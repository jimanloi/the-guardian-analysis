The country\u2019s health ministry said one person was killed and five others, including a child, were wounded. Pro-Iran outlet <strong>Al-Mayadeen</strong> said an Israeli strike targeted an office it had vacated there.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israeli forces have killed 2,574 people and wounded 12,001 others since its attacks across Lebanon, </strong>the country\u2019s health ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. At least 28 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon in the last 24 hours, it said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israeli strikes across Gaza killed 42 people on Wednesday as Israeli forces intensified a siege of northern parts of the Palestinian territory. </strong>Of at least 42 people reported killed by Israeli military strikes across the territory on Wednesday, 37 deaths were in northern Gaza. The health ministry said at least 650 people had been killed since the new Israeli offensive began in the north of Gaza. Gaza\u2019s civil emergency service said all its operations in northern Gaza were suspended after Israeli forces detained five staff members and bombed the only fire truck.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said one of its staff members was killed when an Unrwa vehicle was hit in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Wednesday. </strong>Gaza\u2019s civil emergency service said three of its rescuers were wounded in northern Gaza in what it said was a \u201ctargeted strike\u201d, that aimed to force them out of Jabalia. Health and civil emergency officials said dozens of bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in and around Jabalia were scattered on roadsides and under the rubble where medical teams could not reach them.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel carried out airstrikes on Wednesday in Tyre, one of the largest cities in southern Lebanon,</strong> which had become a refuge over the past year for thousands of families displaced by fighting further south. Israel began to bomb the Unesco-listed city roughly three hours after its military issued an order online for residents to flee central areas.

Huge clouds of thick smoke were seen billowing above residential buildings.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US secretary of state Antony Blinken said his country is tracking \u201cvery, very, very carefully\u201d efforts by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a> to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza</strong>. He accused Israel of previously having fallen back on promises of sustained deliveries. Blinken said Israel\u2019s success against Hamas had come at \u201cgreat cost\u201d to Palestinian civilians.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US believes</strong> <strong>there is a greater chance of a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel now that the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been killed in Gaza by Israeli forces, Blinken said.</strong> Having described Sinwar as \u201cthe primary obstacle\u201d to reaching a deal, it was also announced that Blinken would be in London later this week in order to meet with Arab leaders.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant has told pilots and aircrews at Hatzerim airbase \u201cafter we strike in Iran, everyone will understand what you did in the preparation and training process\u201d</strong>, according to Israeli media reports.

If you want to read more on the strikes in Beirut and the crisis in the Middle East, the latest report from our correspondents on the ground is here: Lebanon\u2019s government said on Wednesday at least 28 people had been killed by Israeli strikes in the previous 24 hours, raising the total death toll since October 2023 to 2,574. Arriving in Lebanon for talks on ending hostilities, Germany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said providing arms to Israel posed a dilemma: On the one hand, Israel is attacked every day and not supporting it would mean that people are not [being] protected ... On the other, it is also Germany\u2019s responsibility to stand up for international humanitarian law.\u201d Baerbock later warned that a complete destabilisation of Lebanon would be \u201cfatal for the most religiously diverse society in the region.\u201d Israel\u2019s army has been able to weaken Hezbollah significantly. Now we need a diplomatic solution.\u201d Syria is teetering on the brink of a \u201cmilitary, humanitarian and economic storm,\u201d a top UN official said on Wednesday, warning of escalating violence within the country and spillover from fighting in neighbouring Gaza and Lebanon. \u201cThe fires of conflict are raging in the occupied Palestinian Territory, including Gaza, and in Lebanon,\u201d Geir Pedersen, special envoy for Syria, told the UN Security Council. \u201cAnd the heat is being felt in Syria too,\u201d he added, warning \u201cregional spillover into Syria is alarming and could get much worse.\u201d While Israel has for years struck Hezbollah positions in Syria, it has increased its air raids as its conflict in Lebanon expands, accusing the group of funnelling weapons to Lebanon from Syria. \u201cThe past month has seen the fastest-paced and broadest-ranging campaign of Israeli airstrikes in the last thirteen years,\u201d Pedersen told the Security Council, adding residential areas, \u201ceven in the heart of Damascus,\u201d have been hit. Meanwhile, airstrikes by Russia, which supports the Syrian government, have resumed for the first time and months, while pro-government forces have \u201csignificantly accelerated\u201d their own drone strikes and shelling, Pedersen added. \u201cWe are seeing all the ingredients for a military, humanitarian and economic storm breaking on an already devastated Syria,\u201d he said. Defence secretary Lloyd Austin has told his Israeli counterpart that the US is deeply concerned about \u201creports of strikes against the Lebanese Armed Forces\u201d. A Pentagon read out of a conversation between Austin and Israeli minister of defence Yoav Gallant stated that US secretary also \u201cemphasized the importance of taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of the Lebanese Armed Forces and UNIFIL (UN peacekeeping) forces.\u201d After reaffirming the US\u2019s \u201cunwavering and enduring support for Israel\u201d, Austin urged Israel to \u201ctake all necessary steps to address the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, and to work to seize opportunities for the release of hostages and a ceasefire presented by the death of Yahya Sinwar.\u201d More on the announcement from the World Health Organization that due to the \u201cescalating violence and intense bombardments\u201d in northern Gaza, the third phase of a vital polio vaccination campaign has been postponed. In a statement, the WHO said a \u201clack of assured humanitarian pauses across most of northern Gaza\u201d meant the final part of the campaign had to be paused on Wednesday. According to the agency, 119 279 children across northern Gaza were due to be vaccinated. The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure continue to jeopardize people\u2019s safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate. Having a significant number of children miss out on their second vaccine dose will seriously jeopardize efforts to stop the transmission of poliovirus in Gaza.\u201d Earlier we reported that US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said his country was tracking \u201cvery, very, very carefully\u201d efforts by Israel to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He accused Israel of previously having fallen back on promises of sustained deliveries. Blinken said Israel\u2019s success against Hamas had come at \u201cgreat cost\u201d to Palestinian civilians. Israel says aid has been delivered in scores of trucks as well as air drops, but Gaza medics say the aid has not reached them. COGAT, the Israeli military unit tasked with overseeing civilian operations in Gaza, said on Tuesday that 237 trucks containing humanitarian aid from Jordan and the international community had been transferred to northern Gaza over the past eight days. Palestinian health officials and residents said no aid has been allowed into Jabalia, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahiya, three towns on the northern edge of Gaza. Hezbollah has said it struck a military manufacturing firm in the Tel Aviv suburbs with rockets, claiming the hit was accurate. The Iran-backed group said it hit a \u201cmilitary industries company in the suburbs of Tel Aviv with qualitative rockets and hit the target accurately\u201d. Around the time of Hezbollah\u2019s claim, air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and neighbouring cities. The Israeli military said four projectiles were identified as having been fired from Lebanon, two were intercepted, one fell in an open area and one was identified as having fallen in the area. There was no immediate indication of any defence facility having been hit around Tel Aviv and no casualties reported according to the IDF. It comes after Hezbollah said in a statement late on Wednesday that it had escalated its attacks on Israel, using \u201cprecision missiles\u201d for the first time and launched new types of drones on Israeli targets, without offering further details. It\u2019s 1am in Beirut, Gaza and Tel Aviv. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Israeli strikes pounded Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on Wednesday night, levelling several buildings and destroying the offices of a Lebanese broadcaster. Lebanese state media reported 17 Israeli raids with six buildings levelled, marking one of the most violent nights in the area since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah escalated a month ago. The country\u2019s health ministry said one person was killed and five others, including a child, were wounded. Pro-Iran outlet Al-Mayadeen said an Israeli strike targeted an office it had vacated there. Israeli forces have killed 2,574 people and wounded 12,001 others since its attacks across Lebanon, the country\u2019s health ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. At least 28 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon in the last 24 hours, it said. Israeli strikes across Gaza killed 42 people on Wednesday as Israeli forces intensified a siege of northern parts of the Palestinian territory. Of at least 42 people reported killed by Israeli military strikes across the territory on Wednesday, 37 deaths were in northern Gaza. The health ministry said at least 650 people had been killed since the new Israeli offensive began in the north of Gaza. Gaza\u2019s civil emergency service said all its operations in northern Gaza were suspended after Israeli forces detained five staff members and bombed the only fire truck. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said one of its staff members was killed when an Unrwa vehicle was hit in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Wednesday. Gaza\u2019s civil emergency service said three of its rescuers were wounded in northern Gaza in what it said was a \u201ctargeted strike\u201d, that aimed to force them out of Jabalia. Health and civil emergency officials said dozens of bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in and around Jabalia were scattered on roadsides and under the rubble where medical teams could not reach them. Israel carried out airstrikes on Wednesday in Tyre, one of the largest cities in southern Lebanon, which had become a refuge over the past year for thousands of families displaced by fighting further south. Israel began to bomb the Unesco-listed city roughly three hours after its military issued an order online for residents to flee central areas. Videos showed large plumes of smoke billowing between residential buildings in the centre of the city. The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said planned airstrikes on Iran will make the world understand Israel\u2019s military might. The Middle East has been braced for more than three weeks for a threatened Israeli response to Iran\u2019s 1 October missile attack, which was in turn a reprisal for Israel\u2019s killing of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Gallant visited aircrews at Hatzerim airbase on Wednesday and made clear that Israel still intended to strike back. Hezbollah confirmed the death of Hashem Safieddine, who was expected to be Nasrallah\u2019s successor. Israel claimed Safieddine had been killed in an airstrike earlier this month, alongside Ali Hussein Hazima, the head of Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence unit. The death of Safieddine, the most senior Hezbollah official killed since the killing of Nasrallah, throws the leadership of the group further into question. In a statement on Wednesday, Hezbollah pledged to carry on in \u201cthat path of resistance and jihad\u201d that Safieddine had spent his life serving. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said his country is tracking \u201cvery, very, very carefully\u201d efforts by Israel to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He accused Israel of previously having fallen back on promises of sustained deliveries. Blinken said Israel\u2019s success against Hamas had come at \u201cgreat cost\u201d to Palestinian civilians. The US believes there is a greater chance of a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel now that the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, has been killed in Gaza by Israeli forces, Blinken said. Having described Sinwar as \u201cthe primary obstacle\u201d to reaching a deal, it was also announced that Blinken would be in London later this week in order to meet with Arab leaders. Senior Hamas official Dr Basem Naim suggested that Blinken had been wasting his time visiting Israel this week. Rescuers recovered the bodies of a woman and her seven-year-old child after an Israeli airstrike near Lebanon\u2019s largest public hospital in southern Beirut on Monday, according to a Lebanese official. At least 18 people, including four children, were killed and more than 60 others wounded after the Israeli strike hit several buildings near the Rafik Hariri university hospital. The Israeli military said it hit a \u201cHezbollah terrorist target\u201d near the hospital, without giving details, and insisted that the hospital was not targeted. The Israel Defense Forces accused six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of \u201cmilitary affiliation\u201d to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reacted with scepticism, saying that \u201cIsrael has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence\u201d. At least five people were killed and 22 others wounded in an explosion and assault at the headquarters of the national aerospace company, Tusa\u015f, outside Ankara on Wednesday. Turkey\u2019s interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said it was likely that the militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party, or PKK, was responsible for the attack, without giving evidence. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said: \u201cI condemn this heinous terrorist attack and wish mercy on our martyrs.\u201d Here are some images coming through the newswires from Gaza where Israeli strikes have killed at least 42,800 people while forcibly displacing nearly 2 million survivors in the past year: Syrians fleeing Israeli strikes in Lebanon are facing a perilous return to their home country. Ali Haj Suleiman and Annie Kelly report for the Guardian: In the past month, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have reversed this refugee flow, pushing an estimated 425,000 people \u2013 mostly women and children \u2013 back over chaotic and overcrowded border crossings, according to the UN. About 70% of those making the crossing are Syrians, but Lebanese civilians \u2013 the majority thought to be from Hezbollah strongholds in south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley \u2013 have also sought safety in a country still beset by economic strife, division and violence. For many of the Syrians returning home after years of living in exile, the journey back home is a perilous one. At border crossings and checkpoints in regime territory, there have been reports of disappearances, interrogations, detentions, forced conscription, bribery, beatings and harassment of returning refugees. For the full story, click here: Israeli strikes destroyed six buildings in Laylaki, a Beirut suburb, according to Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency. \u201cThe Israeli raids on an area surrounding Al-Laylaki destroyed six buildings,\u201d the news agency said on Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reports. NNA added that the attacks were \u201cthe most violent in the area since the beginning of the war\u201d. Israeli forces have killed 2,574 people and wounded 12,001 others since its attacks across Lebanon, the country\u2019s health ministry said in a new statement on Wednesday. The updated death toll comes after Israeli strikes in the country yesterday caused: Eight deaths and 42 injuries in southern Lebanon. Twelve deaths and 68 injuries in Nabatieh. Three deaths and 11 injuries in Bekaa. Five deaths and 17 injuries in Baalbek-Hermel. One injury in Mount Lebanon. Here are some of the latest images sent from the newswires from Beirut after heavy Israeli airstrikes on the Lebanese capital\u2019s southern suburbs. Lebanon\u2019s official National News Agency (NNA) reported at least 10 Israeli strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Four Israeli strikes hit a residential complex near the southern suburb of al-Laylaki, \u201ccompletely destroying it and causing a large fire\u201d, NNA reported. A joint letter signed by the foreign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over bills introduced to Israel\u2019s parliament that would prevent the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) from operating in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza. The Nordic countries urged Israel to ensure that the UN agency has continued and unhindered humanitarian access to Palestinian refugees. The statement reads: In the midst of an ongoing catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, a halt to any of the organisation\u2019s activities would have devastating consequences for the hundreds of thousands of civilians served by Unrwa. It warned that if the UN body was no longer able to exercise its core tasks, it could further destabilize the situation in the region, \u201cand may fundamentally jeopardise the prospects for a two-state solution\u201d. Heavy Israeli strikes have been reported in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, some reportedly with prior warning and others without. According to Al Jazeera Arabic, there have been nine strikes in southern Beirut tonight. Lebanese media said four Israeli strikes destroyed a residential complex in al-Laylaki in Beirut\u2019s southern suburb, AFP reported. Timour Azhari of Reuters shared footage of the strikes: Hezbollah said its missile struck a military factory in the Tel Aviv suburbs, claiming the hit was accurate. The group, in a separate statement on Wednesday, said it used \u201cprecision missiles\u201d and new types of drones for the first time in their clashes against Israeli troops. It said it had been able to push back Israeli troops in clashes in several border villages in southern Lebanon. An Israeli strike on Wednesday night hit an office used by the Lebanese broadcaster Al Mayadeen in southern Beirut, according to the outlet. In a post on X, Al Mayadeen said its office in Beirut was the target of \u201cIsraeli aggression\u201d. It said the office had been evacuated before the strike. The broadcaster\u2019s office was hit in a strike on a multi-storey building in the Lebanese capital\u2019s southern suburbs, Reuters reported, citing sources. Al Mayadeen has previously accused Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists, citing the channel\u2019s pro-Palestinian stance and pro-Iran\u2019s regional military alliance. Israeli authorities have sought to block Al Mayadeen\u2019s websites and seize equipment linked to the station. Lebanese state media reported that an Israeli drone strike hit an apartment in the Jnah neighbourhood in south Beirut on Wednesday. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reported that a strike targeted a residential apartment near the former location of the Iranian embassy. It also reported other strikes in the Ouzai and Haret Hreik neighbourhoods which were not preceded by an Israeli evacuation warning. The Israeli military has issued new evacuation warnings for residents in southern Beirut ahead of expected airstrikes. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, posted maps of specific buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, warning people to leave the area immediately. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has said that \u201can early ceasefire and an end of war in Gaza are the key to easing regional tensions\u201d, according to state media. As we reported earlier, Xi met with his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of a Brics summit in Russia on Wednesday. Chinese state media Xinhua reported that Xi made the comments about a Gaza ceasefire during his meeting with Pezeshkian. Pezeshkian, at a Brics plenary session, urged members to \u201cuse all their collective and individual capacities to end the war in Gaza and Lebanon\u201d. Turkey\u2019s defence minister, Ya\u015far G\u00fcler, earlier also blamed the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) for the deadly attack at the headquarters of the national aerospace company, Tusa\u015f, outside Ankara on Wednesday. Without giving evidence, G\u00fcler said: We give these PKK scoundrels the punishment they deserve every time. But they never come to their senses. We will pursue them until the last terrorist is eliminated. The number of people killed in an apparent terror attack on a Turkish defence facility in Ankara has risen to five, the country\u2019s interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said. A further 22 people have been injured, with two in critical condition, he told reporters. Yerlikaya added that the perpetrators of the attack were \u201cmost likely\u201d members of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). The White House\u2019s national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, has told reporters that the US \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the attack at the Turkish defence firm near Ankara on Wednesday. Kirby said: While we don\u2019t yet know the motive or who is exactly behind it, we strongly condemn this act of violence. The Israeli military said air raid sirens were activated across central Israel after they were triggered by four rockets launched from Lebanon. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said some of the projectiles were intercepted and several impacted, without specifying where. There were no immediate reports of injuries Rescuers recovered the bodies of a woman and her 7-year-old child two days after an Israeli airstrike near Lebanon\u2019s largest public hospital in southern Beirut, according to a Lebanese official. At least 18 people, including four children, were killed and more than 60 others wounded after the Israeli strike hit several buildings near the Rafik Hariri university hospital. The hospital suffered \u201cmajor damage\u201d from the blast. Saad al-Ahmar, the commander of the Lebanese civil defence\u2019s southern district fire and rescue unit, told Associated Press that the mother and child were from the Mokdad family, seven of whom were killed in Monday\u2019s attack. He added that four to five Syrians and one Sudanese individual remain unaccounted for. The Israeli military said it hit a \u201cHezbollah terrorist target\u201d near the hospital, without giving details, and insisted that the hospital was not targeted. Germany has condemned what it called a \u201chorrific terrorist attack\u201d at the headquarters of the Turkish defence firm, Tusa\u015f, near Ankara on Wednesday. \u201cWe condemn all forms of terrorism in the strongest possible terms,\u201d the German foreign ministry wrote in a post to X. Germany has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey. Away from Israel but in a sign of further instability in the region, here are some of the latest images from Ankara, after four people were killed and 14 others wounded in what Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, described as a \u201cheinous terrorist attack\u201d at the headquarters of the national aerospace company, Tusa\u015f, on Wednesday afternoon. Turkey\u2019s interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, blamed a terrorist attack for the explosion and assault at the building, and said two attackers had been \u201cneutralised\u201d and work was under way to determine their identities. It was not clear who was behind the attack. Kurdish militants, Islamic State and leftist extremists have carried out attacks in the country in the past. Four Palestinians have been killed after an Israeli airstrike targeted a house in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood, southwest of Gaza City on Wednesday evening, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported, citing medical sources. There were additional injuries as a result of the Israeli strike, according to Wafa. It is 8pm in Gaza, Tel Aviv and Beirut. This blog will shortly be handed over to the US team. Here is a summary of the day\u2019s news so far: Hashem Safieddine, the top Hezbollah official widely expected to succeed slain secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli attack, the group said on Wednesday. Israel had said on Tuesday that a strike carried out in Beirut three weeks ago had killed Safieddine, but Hezbollah did not confirm the news until today. Heavy Israeli airstrikes have taken place on the historic Lebanese port city of Tyre. Israel began to bomb the Unesco-listed city roughly three hours after its military issued an order online for residents to flee central areas. Huge clouds of thick smoke were seen billowing above residential buildings. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken said his country is tracking \u201cvery, very, very carefully\u201d efforts by Israel to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He accused Israel of previously having fallen back on promises of sustained deliveries. Blinken said Israel\u2019s success against Hamas had come at \u201cgreat cost\u201d to Palestinian civilians. The US believes there is a greater chance of a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel now that the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been killed in Gaza by Israeli forces, Blinken said. Having described Sinwar as \u201cthe primary obstacle\u201d to reaching a deal, it was also announced that Blinken would be in London later this week in order to meet with Arab leaders. Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant has told pilots and aircrews at Hatzerim airbase \u201cafter we strike in Iran, everyone will understand what you did in the preparation and training process\u201d, according to Israeli media reports. Gallant added: \u201cAnyone who dreamed a year ago of defeating us and striking us has paid a heavy price and is no longer in that dream.\u201d There are no indications any employees from the Office of the Secretary of Defense are being investigated for the leak of US intelligence about Israel\u2019s preparations to strike Iran, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no OSD official being named as a part of this investigation,\u201d Austin said while speaking to reporters in Rome. The FBI said on Tuesday it was investigating the public disclosure of a pair of highly classified documents describing Israel\u2019s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran. Austin added that he did not have any indication that \u201cany OSD official will be implicated as a part of this\u201d. Blinken and Jordan\u2019s foreign minister Ayman Safadi discussed, during a call, \u201cthe importance of securing the release of all hostages in Gaza, alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people, and ending the war in a way that provides peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d the US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, shared. He added that Blinken had thanked Jordan for its \u201cleadership in facilitating the delivery of critical aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza\u201d. Senior Hamas official Dr Basem Naim has suggested that Blinken had been wasting his time visiting Israel this week. The interview, shown on the Al Arabiya channel was one of the first interviews with a senior Hamas figure since the killing of Sinwar by Israel. At least 28 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon in the last 24 hours, bringing the total toll since October 2023 to 2,574, the Lebanese government said on Wednesday. Humanitarian workers face surging violence and worsening working conditions, with intensifying global conflicts and respect for international law on the decline, top Red Cross officials warned on Wednesday. Speaking before the IFRC\u2019s general assembly in Geneva, Forbes voiced alarm that 30 of the network\u2019s volunteers had been killed since the beginning of this year alone. The war between Israel and armed group Hezbollah is expected to wipe 9% off Lebanon\u2019s national wealth as measured by GDP, the United Nations said on Wednesday, with the scale of hostilities and the economic fallout set to surpass the last war in 2006. In a statement Hezbollah claimed on Wednesday that it had fired a rocket salvo at an Israeli army base in Haifa. Israel\u2019s military said in a statement on its official Telegram channel that on Wednesday, as of 3pm local time (noon GMT), it had recorded about 85 projectiles being launched towards Israel from the direction of Lebanon. One Israeli woman was lightly injured by shrapnel on Israel\u2019s coast north of Tel Aviv and 50-year-old man was treated for a shrapnel injury to the head in the Nahariya area by the Magen David Adom ambulance service. Smoke, apparently from an intercepted projectile, could also be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken had been staying. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Authority minister of health has said that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were preventing children from receiving their second dose of the polio vaccine. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that Majid Abu Ramadan \u201chighlighted the significant risks faced by both children and healthcare workers, which impede their access to vaccination centres\u201d due to \u201cescalating Israeli aggression\u201d, and \u201cemphasised that the second dose of the vaccine is crucial for achieving full immunity against polio\u201d. Wafa reported that in the past 24 hours, according to medical sources, 74 civilians had been killed and 130 others injured in Gaza in what it described as six separate attacks by Israeli forces. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Western countries have floated the idea of deploying international forces to Lebanon alongside the country\u2019s army in case of a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, a western diplomat told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday. \u201cWhat is needed right now is a ceasefire and a presence trusted by both sides \u2013 this could be the Lebanese army with international forces,\u201d the diplomat told AFP, requesting anonymity as the matter is sensitive. China\u2019s embassy in Lebanon has suspended passport, visa and other services. Germany\u2019s foreign minister said in Beirut on Wednesday that her country was \u201cin a dilemma\u201d when it comes to exporting weapons to Israel, and added that Israel has a responsibility to abide by international law. Annalena Baerbock added that all parties must protect the UN Interim Force In Lebanon (Unifil). Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Qatar\u2019s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, met in Germany yesterday, and called for intensified diplomatic efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the region In parliament in London, the UK\u2019s deputy prime minister Angela Rayner said that British support of Israel\u2019s security remained \u201csteadfast\u201d, but that the government would always support Israel in \u201ca manner consistent with our obligations to domestic and international law\u201d. Describing the humanitarian situation in Gaza as \u201cdire\u201d, Rayner said this was a \u201creally serious and important issue\u201d. Russia\u2019s state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports that a Hamas official was visiting Moscow for talks with officials, according to a diplomatic source. Iran\u2019s president Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday urged members of the Brics grouping to help \u201cend the war\u201d in Gaza and Lebanon. \u201cI call on all members of the influential Brics group to use all their collective and individual capacities to end the war in Gaza and Lebanon,\u201d said Pezeshkian during a speech at a Brics summit in Russia. Russian president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday told Pezeshkian that he wanted to further \u201cstrengthen\u201d ties with Tehran, which has been widely accused of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine. Pezeshkian also met Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a Brics summit in Russia, according to a report by the Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Israel\u2019s national security council called on Israelis on Wednesday to immediately leave some tourist areas in southern Sri Lanka over the threat of a possible terrorist attack. The agency said the warning pertained to the area of Arugam Bay and beaches in the south and west of Sri Lanka. The security council did not specify the exact nature of the threat and called on Israelis in the rest of Sri Lanka to be cautious and refrain from holding large gatherings in public areas. Humanitarian workers face surging violence and worsening working conditions, with intensifying global conflicts and respect for international law on the decline, top Red Cross officials warned on Wednesday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cToday, our work is increasingly difficult,\u201d said Kate Forbes, president of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. She added: Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.\u201d Forbes was speaking before the IFRC\u2019s general assembly in Geneva, bringing together representatives of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies. Together, they count more than 16 million volunteers worldwide. AFP reports that Forbes voiced alarm that 30 of the network\u2019s volunteers had been killed since the beginning of this year alone. Many of those were victims of the war Israel is waging against Hamas in Gaza, while others died in Sudan\u2019s civil war. \u201cEach loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need,\u201d Forbes said. She warned that \u201cthe surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission\u201d. According to AFP, Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, agreed, arguing the movement was being \u201cconfronted with unprecedented challenges to our principles\u201d. \u201cAs we come together today, intense armed conflicts and political turmoil shape the world we operate in,\u201d she told the assembly. She added: The relevance of impartial, neutral, and independent humanitarian action \u2013 which ensure we can reach those most in need \u2013 are being tested at an alarming rate. This is exactly when our commitment to these principles matters most.\u201d Spoljaric\u2019s ICRC will co-organise an international conference with the IFRC next week in Geneva, due to focus heavily on how to boost compliance with international law. She said the planet\u2019s largest humanitarian network was seeing \u201cthe world standing by, allowing for dehumanisation of entire populations\u201d. \u201cThis is precisely when we must work together to put humanity at the centre,\u201d she said. Faced with the rising death toll, Forbes on Wednesday announced the establishment of \u201cthe Red Family Fund\u201d, aimed at providing financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty, reports AFP. \u201cThis is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honour those who care for others,\u201d she said. The war between Israel and armed group Hezbollah is expected to wipe 9% off Lebanon\u2019s national wealth as measured by GDP, the United Nations said on Wednesday, with the scale of hostilities and the economic fallout set to surpass the last war in 2006. Reuters reports that the UN Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) rapid appraisal of the conflict\u2019s impact on Lebanon\u2019s gross domestic product was released a day ahead of a summit hosted by France to help drum up international support for Lebanon. UNDP said it expected the conflict to last until the end of 2024, leading to a 30% jump in the government\u2019s financing needs in a country in dire straits even before violence began. \u201cGDP is projected to decline by 9.2% compared to a no-war scenario, indicating a significant decline in economic activity as a direct consequence of the conflict (around 2 billion dollars),\u201d the report said. UNDP said that even if the war ended in 2024, the consequences would persist for years, with GDP likely to contract by 2.28% in 2025 and 2.43% in 2026. Lebanon was already suffering a four-year-old economic downturn and a political crisis when Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel last year in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas. In late September, Israel dramatically ramped up its bombing across Lebanon, with strikes now regularly hitting Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, major cities in southern Lebanon and parts of the eastern Bekaa valley, including the border with Syria. Hezbollah and Israel last fought in 2006, when a month-long conflict left much of Lebanon\u2019s south and the capital\u2019s southern suburbs in ruins and required international help to rebuild. According to Reuters, the UNDP said the damage to physical infrastructure, housing and productive capacities like factories would probably be close to that estimated for the 2006 war, which was between $2.5bn and $3.6bn. But it warned of larger overall damage to Lebanon. \u201cThe scale of the military engagement, the geopolitical context, the humanitarian impact and the economic fallout in 2024 are expected to be much greater than in 2006,\u201d it said. UNDP\u2019s report said the closure of border crossings critical for trade would bring a 21% drop in trade activities, and that it expected job losses in the tourism, agriculture and construction sectors. It said Lebanon had already sustained \u201cmassive environmental losses\u201d over the last year, including due to unexploded ordnance and contamination from possibly hazardous material, particularly the use of white phosphorus across southern Lebanon. Government revenue is expected to fall by 9% and total investment by more than 6% through both 2025 and 2026. As a result, increased international assistance will be essential for sustainable recovery in Lebanon, UNDP said \u2013 not only to address the spike in humanitarian needs but to stem the long-term social and economic consequences of the conflict. Lebanon\u2019s minister in charge of its crisis response told Reuters that the country needed $250m a month to help more than 1.2 million people displaced by Israeli strikes. In southern Lebanon, Agence France-Presse (AFP) correspondents reported several Israeli airstrikes on the coastal city of Tyre, after the military told people to flee before it targets Hezbollah. The warning sparked a new exodus from the city, where AFPTV footage showed plumes of thick black smoke rising after strikes. \u201cThe situation is very bad, we\u2019re evacuating people,\u201d said Mortada Mhanna, who heads Tyre\u2019s disaster management unit. \u201cYou could say that the entire city of Tyre is being evacuated,\u201d said Bilal Kashmar, the unit\u2019s media officer. At least 28 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon in the last 24 hours, bringing the total toll since October 2023 to 2,574, the Lebanese government said on Wednesday. Chinese president Xi Jinping on Wednesday met Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of a Brics summit in Russia, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP) citing Chinese state news agency Xinhua. China and Iran are political and economic partners, in part due to their stance on the war in Ukraine. William Christou is a Beirut-based journalist reporting on Lebanon for the Guardian. He has shared the following on Hashem Safieddine\u2019s death: Hezbollah confirmed in a statement on Wednesday afternoon, the death of Hashem Safieddine, who was presumed to be the next leader of Hezbollah before being killed by an Israeli strike in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut on 3 October. Hezbollah\u2019s statement confirmed Israel\u2019s claims the night prior which said that Safieddine had been killed in the airstrike earlier in the month, alongside Ali Hussein Huzima, head of the group\u2019s intelligence unit. In the statement, Hezbollah said that Safieddine spent most of his life serving Hezbollah and that he \u201ccompetently managed\u201d the executive council \u2013 the highest political decision-making body in Hezbollah. The group further pledged to carry on in \u201cthat path of resistance and jihad\u201d. The death of Safieddine, who was the senior-most political official killed in Hezbollah since the killing of late-secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, throws the leadership of the group into question. The current de-facto public face of the group is Naeem Qassem, the deputy secretary general of Hezbollah, but he has not yet been picked as its permanent leader. Despite most of its senior military command and top political leaders having been killed by Israel over the past three months, Hezbollah has said that the organisation retains its ability to fight Israel. Hashem Safieddine, the top Hezbollah official widely expected to succeed slain secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli attack, the group said on Wednesday. Hezbollah confirmed that Safieddine was killed in an Israeli airstrike, reports Reuters. According to Reuters, Safieddine had been running Hezbollah alongside its deputy secretary general Naim Qassem since Nasrallah\u2019s assassination and was expected to be formally elected as its next secretary general, although no official announcement had yet been made. A relative of Nasrallah, Safieddine had sat on the group\u2019s Jihad Council \u2013 the body responsible for its military operations. He was also head of its executive council, overseeing Hezbollah\u2019s financial and administrative affairs. According to Reuters, Safieddine assumed a prominent role speaking for Hezbollah during the year of hostilities with Israel that ultimately led to his death, addressing funerals and other events that Nasrallah had long been unable to attend for security reasons. His killing further erodes the group\u2019s top leadership as Israeli strikes pummel Lebanon\u2019s south, eastern Bekaa valley and southern suburbs of Beirut \u2013 all Hezbollah strongholds \u2013 and the group\u2019s fighters seek to push back Israeli ground incursions. Israel has carried out heavy airstrikes on Tyre, a historic port city in Lebanon. The bombardment of the Unesco-listed city began roughly three hours after the Israeli military issued an order online for residents to flee central areas. Huge clouds of thick smoke can be seen billowing above residential buildings in the below video: Tens of thousands of people had reportedly fled Tyre in recent weeks as Israel stepped up its aerial campaign in Lebanon. About 1.2 million people have been displaced in total across the country, according to the Lebanese government. Russian president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday told Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian he wanted to further \u201cstrengthen\u201d ties with Tehran, which has been widely accused of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cOne of the main tasks in our relations is to strengthen the emerging positive trend in trade and economic cooperation,\u201d Putin said. Western countries have floated the idea of deploying international forces to Lebanon alongside the country\u2019s army in case of a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, a western diplomat told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday. About 10,000 peacekeepers with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) are already deployed in the country\u2019s south, but the diplomat said a separate multinational troop deployment was under consideration. \u201cWhat is needed right now is a ceasefire and a presence trusted by both sides \u2013 this could be the Lebanese army with international forces,\u201d the diplomat told AFP, requesting anonymity as the matter is sensitive. \u201cPartners of Lebanon have already been supporting the Lebanese army and are looking very concretely into how they can support it further \u2026 in the context of a ceasefire and long-term diplomatic agreement,\u201d the diplomat added. UN security council resolution 1701, which ended a 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and called for the deployment of only Lebanese government forces Unifil peacekeepers in south Lebanon, has come under fire for its limited implementation, reports AFP. Lebanese media outlets have reported discussions on bolstering the UN resolution\u2019s implementation, dubbing such an option as \u201c1701-plus\u201d. On a visit to Beirut on Monday, US envoy Amos Hochstein said that \u201cboth sides simply committing to 1701 is just not enough.\u201d \u201cWe have to put things in place that would allow for confidence that it will be implemented for everyone,\u201d he added. The western diplomat speaking to AFP said that \u201cthe push towards a 1701-plus is a reflection of the reality that neither side implemented\u201d the resolution. Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati said this month that Lebanon was ready to bolster the army in the south after any ceasefire was reached. The Magen David Adom ambulance service has said it is treating a 50-year-old man for a shrapnel wound to the head in the Nahariya area of Israel after rocket fire from the direction of Lebanon. Earlier, in a separate incident, a woman was injured north of Tel Aviv on Israel\u2019s coast by shrapnel. The Al Arabiya channel is carrying an interview with senior Hamas official, Dr Basem Naim. In the clip, one of the first interviews with a senior Hamas figure since the killing of Yahya Sinwar by Israel, Naim suggests that Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has been wasting his time visiting Israel this week. He says that the trip was \u201ca grand stand to buy more time for the remaining period of the [US] elections, in order to try to contain the situation as much as possible so that they are not getting more, worse pictures from inside Gaza.\u201d Naim says \u201cEither he comes here to say to the Israelis \u2018you have to stop the aggression immediately\u2019, or I would advise him to spare the time to go back to Washington.\u201d Naim has been criticised for previously claiming that the 7 October Hamas attack only targeted \u201cIsraeli military bases and compounds.\u201d Here are some of the latest images from Gaza sent to us over the news wires. Charles Stratford, reporting for Al Jazeera from Beirut, says that today\u2019s Israeli airstrikes on Tyre are likely to lead to further waves of displaced people attempting to find refuge in Lebanon\u2019s capital. He writes: These developments on Tyre are a clear sign of an escalation by the Israeli military. This of course is of huge concern, even here in Beirut, because it\u2019s expected we\u2019re going to see people potentially arriving from those areas in the coming areas and days. Although Beirut is managing, at the moment it is under huge pressure to try and accommodate the hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced [to the capital]. People are being accommodated by friends and relatives, just the generosity of some people willing to accommodate some of these people who have been forced out of their homes, but there are also a lot of people living, for example, on the Corniche in tents without any proper cover. Israel\u2019s military reports that warning sirens have again sounded in the north of the country. In a statement Hezbollah has claimed it fired a rocket salvo at an Israeli army base in Haifa. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Authority minister of health has said that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were preventing children from receiving their second dose of the polio vaccine. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Majid Abu Ramadan \u201chighlighted the significant risks faced by both children and healthcare workers, which impede their access to vaccination centres\u201d due to \u201cescalating Israeli aggression\u201d, and \u201cemphasized that the second dose of the vaccine is crucial for achieving full immunity against polio.\u201d In August a Palestinian baby in Gaza was left partly paralysed from polio in the first case there for 25 years. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller has given details of a call between secretary of state Antony Blinken and Jordan\u2019s foreign minister Ayman Safadi. He said the pair discussed \u201cthe importance of securing the release of all hostages in Gaza, alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people, and ending the war in a way that provides peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d and that Blinken thanked Jordan for its \u201cleadership in facilitating the delivery of critical aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\u201d They also discussed the situation in Lebanon, where over 2,000 people have been killed and 1.2 million people forced from their homes by Israeli air strikes in recent weeks. Tens of thousands have Israelis have also been forced to flee their home in northern Israel due to almost continuous rocket fire from Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups with positions in southern Lebanon. The US statement said Blinken and Safadi \u201cdiscussed the need to reach a diplomatic resolution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that fully implements UN security council resolution 1701 and allows civilians on both sides of the blue line to return to their homes.\u201d Israel\u2019s military has said in a statement on its official Telegram channel that on Wednesday, as of 3pm local time (noon GMT), it had recorded about 85 projectiles being launched towards Israel from the direction of Lebanon. In addition, an earlier statement said that during the course of the day Israel\u2019s military had intercepted five drones attempting to cross into Israel\u2019s airspace. In parliament in London, the UK\u2019s deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has said that British support of Israel\u2019s security remains \u201csteadfast\u201d, but that the government will always support Israel in \u201ca manner consistent with our obligations to domestic and international law.\u201d Describing the humanitarian situation in Gaza as \u201cdire\u201d, Rayner said this was a \u201creally serious and important issue,\u201d telling MPs: The humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is dire, and we need an immediate ceasefire and much more aid allowed to flow in, and an immediate release of all the hostages. We have suspended UK export licenses to Israel for items which might be used in the current conflict, and this government has concluded that there is a clear risk that items exported to Israel might be used in serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza. This does not change our position, of steadfast support for Israel\u2019s security, but we will always do so in a manner consistent with our obligations to domestic and international law. Rayner was responding to a question from Labour colleague Dawn Butler, the MP for Brent East in north-west London, who had asked what \u201ctangible, concrete measures\u201d the government would take if the Israeli government would not listen to pleas from prime minister Keir Starmer for more humanitarian assistance to be directed to Gaza. She told MPs: I watched in horror and condemned the attack on 7 October by terrorist group Hamas. A year later, I watch in horror as 42,000 people are killed in Gaza, 11,000 of them children, people burned alive attached to drips, aid workers killed, and now families are starving. The prime minister has said that the world will not stand by and see this lack of humanitarian assistance. If the Israeli government will not listen to our Prime Minister\u2019s words, what tangible, measurable actions will we take as the UK British government? Israeli media is reporting that defense minister Yoav Gallant has told pilots and air crews at Hatzerim Airbase \u201cafter we strike in Iran, everyone will understand what you did in the preparation and training process.\u201d He added \u201cAnyone who dreamed a year ago of defeating us and striking us has paid a heavy price and is no longer in that dream.\u201d Israel has been expected to retaliate for waves of missiles fired at it by Iran on 1 October. One person in the occupied West Bank was killed, and two people in Israel were wounded during the Iranian strikes, which were mostly deflected by air defences. Tehran launched the assault after Israel\u2019s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for more than three decades, in a series of strikes on the group\u2019s underground headquarters in Dahieh, a southern suburb of Beirut. Earlier today, US secretary of state Antony Blinken told the media that Israel must be careful to retaliate in a way that does not further escalate tension in the region. Israel\u2019s national security council called on Israelis on Wednesday to immediately leave some tourist areas in southern Sri Lanka over the threat of a possible terrorist attack, Reuters reports. The agency said the warning pertained to the area of Arugam Bay and beaches in the south and west of Sri Lanka. The security council did not specify the exact nature of the threat and called on Israelis in the rest of Sri Lanka to be cautious and refrain from holding large gatherings in public areas. The US embassy in Sri Lanka also released a security alert stating it had received \u201ccredible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area\u201d. Germany\u2019s foreign minister said in Beirut on Wednesday that her country was \u201cin a dilemma\u201d when it comes to exporting weapons to Israel, and added that Israel has a responsibility to abide by international law. Annalena Baerbock added that all parties must protect the UN Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL). There are no indications any employees from the Office of the Secretary of Defense are being investigated for the leak of US intelligence about Israel\u2019s preparations to strike Iran, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no OSD official being named as a part of this investigation,\u201d Austin said while speaking to reporters in Rome. The FBI said on Tuesday it was investigating the public disclosure of a pair of highly classified documents describing Israel\u2019s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran. Austin added that he did not have any indication that \u201cany OSD official will be implicated as a part of this.\u201d Iran\u2019s president Masoud Pezeshkian urged Wednesday members of the Brics grouping to help \u201cend the war\u201d in Gaza and Lebanon. \u201cI call on all members of the influential Brics group to use all their collective and individual capacities to end the war in Gaza and Lebanon,\u201d said Pezeshkian during a speech at a Brics summit in Russia. Further to our earlier report about air raid sirens in Israel, smoke, apparently from an intercepted projectile, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where US secretary of state Antony Blinken was staying. Blinken urged Israel to use its recent tactical victories against Hamas to seek a war-ending deal and bring back dozens of hostages, before leaving on Wednesday for Saudi Arabia as part of his 11th visit to the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Heavy Israeli air strikes have taken place on the historic Lebanese port city of Tyre. Israel began to bomb the Unesco-listed city roughly three hours after its military issued an order online for residents to flee central areas. Huge clouds of thick smoke billowed above residential buildings The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said his country is tracking \u201cvery, very, very carefully\u201d efforts by Israel to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into the beseiged Palestinian territory of Gaza. He accused Israel of previously having fallen back on promises of sustained deliveries. Blinken said Israel\u2019s success against Hamas had come at \u201cgreat cost\u201d to Palestinian civilians The US believes there is a greater chance of a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel now that the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been killed in Gaza by Israeli forces, Blinken said. Having described Sinwar as \u201cthe primary obstacle\u201d to reaching a deal, it was also announced that Blinken would be in London later this week in order to meet with Arab leaders Israel\u2019s military has said about 25 projectiles were fired into northern Israel on Wednesday morning from Lebanon. One Israeli woman was lightly wounded by shrapnel on Israel\u2019s coast north of Tel Aviv Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that in the past 24 hours, according to medical sources, 74 civilians have been killed and 130 others injured in Gaza in what it describes as six separate attacks by Israeli forces. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict China\u2019s embassy in Lebanon has suspended passport, visa and other services Germany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock is visiting Beirut. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Qatar\u2019s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, met in Germany yesterday, and called for intensified diplomatic efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the region Russia\u2019s state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports that a Hamas official is visiting Moscow for talks with officials, according to a diplomatic source Heavy Israeli airstrikes have taken place on the historic Lebanese port city of Tyre. Israel began to bomb the Unesco-listed city roughly three hours after its military issued an order online for residents to flee central areas. Huge clouds of thick smoke billowed above residential buildings. Reuters reports that tens of thousands of people had already fled Tyre in recent weeks as Israel steps up its aerial campaign in Lebanon. About 1.2 million people have been displaced in total across the country, according to the Lebanese government. Israel claims to be carrying out targeted strikes on what it describes as \u201cHezbollah terrorist infrastructure. The port is typically described as a bustling hub, but Israel\u2019s evacuation orders this week for the city have for the first time encompassed swathes of it, including right up to its ancient castle. Lebanese media continues to report widespread strikes by Israel across the country, with five reported dead in Bint Jbeil, near northern Israel. During the last two hours, Israel\u2019s military has reported four separate instances of warning sirens sounding in northern Israel. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that in the past 24 hours, according to medical sources, 74 civilians have been killed and 130 others injured in Gaza in what it describes as six separate attacks by Israeli forces. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said his country is tracking \u201cvery, very, very carefully\u201d efforts by Israel to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into the beseiged Palestinian territory of Gaza, accusing Israel of previously having fallen back on sustained deliveries. In words before he left Israel for Saudi Arabia, Blinken told the media: It\u2019s absolutely essential that humanitarian assistance get to the people who need it in Gaza. And as you know, a couple of weeks ago defense secretary Lloyd Austin and I wrote to the Israeli defense minister, the strategic affairs minister, with a list of things that need to happen in order for assistance to get more effectively to people who need that assistance. So we went over that in some detail yesterday, and I can report that there\u2019s progress made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made. And most critically, it needs to be sustained. We\u2019ve had periods before where the Israelis have increased what they\u2019re doing, only to see it fall back. So we\u2019re tracking this very, very, very carefully, and we went over it in some detail. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said he believes there is a greater chance of a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel now that the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been killed in Gaza by Israeli forces. Speaking in Israel ahead of visiting Saudi Arabia, Blinken told the media: When it comes to the hostages, I met again with hostage families last night, including the families of the seven Americans who remain in Gaza. And that reinforces once again for me and for all of us the urgency, the imperative of bringing them home, bringing all of them home. We talked about the plan that we\u2019ve had on the table and the work that we\u2019re doing on that plan, looking at new frameworks of foreign relations as a possibility. We talked about the importance of determining whether Hamas is prepared to engage in moving forward, and the Egyptians, the Qataris are doing just that. But I believe that with [Yahya] Sinwar gone, because he was the primary obstacle for realising the hostage agreement, there is a real opportunity to bring them home and to accomplish the objective. Blinken is to head for talks in London with Arab leaders later this week, after his visit to the Middle East concludes. It has generally been understood that the sticking points between the two sides were that Hamas wished the IDF to completely withdraw from Gaza before it would begin the release of hostages, while Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government has been insisting that it retain continued control of the Philadelphi corridor in southern Gaza, including the Rafah crossing. For its part, Egypt, one of the countries involved in attempting to broker a deal, has said it would not accept any change in the status of the Rafah crossing which links Gaza and Egypt. About 100 of the 250 hostages seized and abducted during the 7 October attack are believed to still be held in captivity in Gaza more than a year after the surprise Hamas attack inside southern Israel. The US state department has issued a full transcript of secretary of state Antony Blinken\u2019s earlier remarks as he departed Israel to head for Saudi Arabia, during which he said Israel\u2019s success against Hamas had come at a \u201cgreat cost\u201d to Palestinian civilians in Gaza During the press briefing, Blinken said: Israel has achieved most of its strategic objectives when it comes to Gaza, all with the idea of making sure that 7 October could never happen again. It has managed to dismantle Hamas\u2019s military capacity. It has destroyed much of its arsenal. It has eliminated its senior leadership, including, most recently, Yahya Sinwar. This has come at the cost \u2013 the great cost \u2013 of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Now is the time to turn those successes into an enduring strategic success, and there are really two things left to do: get the hostages home and bring the war to an end with an understanding of what will follow. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working on this past day and will continue to work on throughout this trip. Blinken has now arrived in Riyadh, where he was greeted by the US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Michael Ratney. China\u2019s embassy in Lebanon has suspended passport, visa and other services, Reuters reports. It will continue to process travel permits for Chinese nationals in Lebanon. News wires are now carrying images from the Lebanese city of Tyre, which has been struck by Israeli forces. Over 2,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks inside Lebanon in the last few weeks according to the Lebanese government. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced. Israel claims it is carrying out targeted strikes on what it describes as \u201cHezbollah terrorist infrastructure.\u201d Unverified images and video are being shared on social media which purport to show the aftermath of Israeli air strikes on the historic Lebanese port city of Tyre. Earlier Israel\u2019s military ordered citizens of the city to evacuate. Within the last thirty minutes Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency has also reported Israeli strikes on Taraya and on Arnon. It also reports that three people have been killed during an Israeli strike on Maarka. Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports that a Hamas official is visiting Moscow. On its Telegram channel, the news agency posted: The deputy head of the Hamas politburo arrives in Moscow on a visit and several meetings with Russian officials are planned, a diplomatic source told RIA Novosti. US secretary of state Antony Blinken will travel to the UK later this week after his Middle East visit concludes. Reuters reports US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken will hold meetings with Arab leaders in London. Blinken is leaving Israel today to head to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. In a statement on its official Telegram channel, Israel\u2019s military has said that about 25 projectiles were fired at central and upper Galilee earlier on Wednesday from the direction of Lebanon. It said \u201cMost were intercepted, fallen projectiles were identified\u201d. There were no immediate reports of any casualties. Earlier one Israeli woman was reported lightly wounded by shrapnel after a rocket attack on Israel\u2019s coast north of Tel Aviv. Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting for Al Jazeera from Deir el-Balah in Gaza has said \u201cwords fail to describe what is going on now in northern Gaza.\u201d Writing for the news network, he said: Civilians are witnessing brutality in one of the deadliest ethnic cleansing campaigns ever witnessed. Witnesses reported horrific details of what is happening this morning in Jabalia, where Israel is demolishing and burning homes to the ground. And in Beit Lahiya \u2013 now turned into one of the most densely populated areas in Gaza after Palestinians fled there from Jabalia \u2013 the situation is dust and smoke coming from every corner with the smell of death everywhere. Al Jazeera has been banned from operating inside Israel by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. Reuters has a quick snap that Israel has launched airstrikes on the port city of Tyre. Israel\u2019s military earlier issued an order for civilians to disperse from the city in the neighbouring country of Lebanon. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has arrived in Beirut. Reuters reports in a statement she said \u201cThe task now is to work with our partners in the US, Europe and the Arab world to find a viable diplomatic solution that safeguards the legitimate security interests of both Israel and Lebanon.\u201d Israeli media reports that earlier one woman was \u201clightly wounded\u201d by shrapnel after a rocket was fired at Herzliya, on Israel\u2019s coast, north of Tel Aviv. In a statement on its official Telegram channel, Israel\u2019s military has claimed that overnight it struck at weapons storage facilities in Beirut in Lebanon. In the message, the IDF said the targets were \u201cmanufacturing facilities and command centres belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization which were located within civilian infrastructure.\u201d It continued \u201cThis strike is part of the efforts to damage Hezbollah\u2019s weapons storage and manufacturing facilities that are embedded beneath residential buildings in the heart of the city of Beirut, endangering the population in the area.\u201d The claims have not been independently verified. Lebanon\u2019s government has said that over 2,000 people have been killed and more than 1.2 million people displaced by Israeli airstrikes on the country in recent weeks. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been forced to flee their homes in northern Israel after a year of sustained rocket fire from Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli forces in southern Lebanon aimed at Israel. The Palestinian Wafa news agency is reporting that \u201cat least eight civilians were killed and others were injured\u201d in ongoing Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday morning. The claims have not been independently verified. Lufthansa has, according to Reuters, announced that it is extending the suspension of flights serving Beirut and Tehran until the end of February 2025. Beirut\u2019s international airport remains open, but Lebanese flag carrier Middle East Airlines is the only airline offering a significant number of departures. US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said the US fully rejects the idea of Israel permanently occupying Gaza, and said that Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government have an opportunity to turn its military campaign against Hamas into \u201can enduring strategic success\u201d. Speaking to reporters on his way from Tel Aviv to Riyadh on the next stage of his Middle East visit, Reuters reports Blinken urged Israel on Wednesday to use the opportunity created by its success in dismantling Hamas\u2019 capacity in Gaza and the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to reach a longer term solution in the conflict. It quoted him saying: Now is the time to turn those successes into an enduring strategic success. And there are really two things left to do, get the hostages home and bring the war to an end with an understanding of what will follow. Blinken said he believed that Israel had made progress in the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, but that more was needed, and the top US diplomat added that his country is working to get a clear understanding of what Israel plans for the governance of Gaza going forward. He said it was necessary for there to be concrete plans for the way ahead. Blinken also said that Israel\u2019s expected response to Iran\u2019s 1 October missile attack on the country needed to be done in a way that did not create greater escalation. Earlier this week the FBI launched an investigation into the unauthorized release of classified documents describing Israel\u2019s preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran. Tehran said it launched its attack on 1 October in retaliation for a series of attacks against Iran and the militias it backs across the Middle East, including Hezbollah, and the assassination by Israel of Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Reuters reports that a German government spokesperson has given a readout of a meeting between Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Qatar\u2019s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The pair stressed the importance of a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and called for intensified diplomatic efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the region during talks in Germany on Tuesday, the spokesperson said. Scholz thanks the Emir for his efforts in negotiating to release Israeli hostages held in Gaza by Hamas for over a year, and said that he hoped the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israel opened up chances for a ceasefire. Members of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government in Israel have repeatedly made clear that they are opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state and harbour an ambition to permanently annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has vowed to fight on after the death of Sinwar, who was considered to be behind the surprise 7 October attack inside southern Israel in 2023 which killed about 1,200 people and during which about 250 people were abducted and seized as hostages, many of whom were subsequently killed. About 100 hostages are believed to still be in Gaza, with Israeli authorities believing that not all of them are alive. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency has reported an Israeli airstrike in Qana, stating that there were no casualties. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for rocket fire towards central Israel on Wednesday, claiming to have targeted an Israeli intelligence base north of Tel Aviv. Israel\u2019s military, in a statement on its official Telegram channel, has claimed to have killed another senior Hezbollah figure. Naming Khalil Mohammad Amhaz as \u201ca terrorist operative in Hezbollah\u2019s Aerial Unit\u201d the IDF claimed he was \u201ca significant source of expertise for Hezbollah\u2019s Aerial Unit, which is responsible for developing and launching explosive and intelligence-gathering UAVs into Israel.\u201d It said he had been killed in the Hermel area of Lebanon, which is in the north-east of the country. The claims have not been independently verified. Israel said on Tuesday a strike it carried out in Beirut three weeks ago killed Hashem Safieddine, the presumed successor to late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also killed in an Israeli attack last month. Safieddine was the head of Hezbollah\u2019s highest political decision-making body, the executive council, and was also a cousin of the former secretary general. And as William Christou, who is filing for the Guardian from Beirut writes, he was seen as having much of the same charisma that inspired the cult of personality around Nasrallah. With the killing of Safieddine, only Naim Qassem, the deputy secretary general of Hezbollah, remains from Hezbollah\u2019s public-facing senior leadership. Qassem has been the face of the group since the assassination of Nasrallah, but he does not enjoy the same popularity among Hezbollah supporters that the late secretary general had. It remains unknown who will take the helm as the next leader of the group. In a speech two weeks ago, Qassem said that appointing a new leader was a complex procedure and would take some time. Alongside blows to its political leadership, almost all of Hezbollah\u2019s senior military cadre has been killed by Israel in the last three months. Despite the losses in its command structure, Hezbollah has insisted that the group has retained its organisational strength. The group has said this is evidenced by what it says is Israel\u2019s lack of progress in south Lebanon. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Middle East conflict. Israel said on Tuesday a strike it carried out in Beirut three weeks ago killed Hashem Safieddine, the presumed successor to late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also killed in an Israeli attack last month. \u201cWe have reached Nasrallah, his replacement and most of Hezbollah\u2019s senior leadership. We will reach anyone who threatens the security of the civilians of the State of Israel,\u201d said Israeli army chief Lt Gen Herzi Halevi. There was no immediate response from Hezbollah. The confirmation of Safieddine\u2019s death came as Antony Blinken was due to visit Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a last-minute change from plans to head to Jordan attributed to scheduling issues. In Tel Aviv on Tuesday, the US secretary of state pressed Israel\u2019s leaders to work towards a ceasefire in Gaza, as fighting continued to rage in the territory\u2019s aid-starved north and as Israeli strikes pounded Lebanon. \u201cI believe very much that the death of Sinwar does create an important opportunity to bring the hostages home, to bring the war to an end and to ensure Israel\u2019s security,\u201d Blinken said as he met Israeli president Isaac Herzog. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer told Blinken in their meeting that Israel is not implementing the so-called General\u2019s Plan aimed at isolating and starving out northern Gaza. Blinken urged Netanyahu to clarify this publicly, but the prime minister demurred, according to a US official that briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. \u201cThey said it\u2019s absolutely not our policy,\u201d the US official said, according to AFP, adding that the Israeli officials were told that they should \u201cgo to greater lengths to actually sort of say that publicly\u201d. In other developments: Israel is weighing the use of private security contractors \u2013 possibly involving UK special forces veterans \u2013 to deliver aid to Gaza, as conditions in the north of the strip worsen dramatically, the Guardian has learned. At least three Israeli strikes targeted Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs Tuesday evening, according to Lebanon\u2019s official ANI news agency. Two of the strikes hit the Laylake district, near a stadium. The strikes came shortly after Israel\u2019s military issued new evacuation warnings for residents in specific buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry on Tuesday revised upward the casualty toll from the Israeli strike near Beirut\u2019s main government hospital on Monday to at least 18 people killed, including four children, and 60 wounded. Israeli jets hit a Hezbollah target close to the Rafik Hariri university hospital in Beirut but did not target the hospital and it was not affected by the strike, the Israeli military said on Tuesday. At least 63 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon over the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 2,530, the Lebanese government said on Tuesday. It also said that more than 11,800 people had been wounded by Israeli strikes on Lebanon since October 2023. Seven Palestinian civilians were killed during Israeli artillery bombardment of a school sheltering displaced people in northern Gaza on Tuesday, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency reported, citing local sources. Separately, at least three Palestinians were killed and several wounded by an Israeli drone strike targeting a group of people in western Gaza City, the Anadolu news agency said. Palestinians under an Israeli siege in northern Gaza \u201care rapidly exhausting all available means for their survival\u201d, the UN\u2019s humanitarian office has warned. The UN\u2019s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of denying its requests to deliver life-saving aid to northern Gaza, as well as of denying requests to help rescue dozens of people trapped under their collapsed homes in the Falouja area of the Jabalia refugee camp in the north. Lebanon will need $250m a month to help more than a million people displaced by Israeli attacks, its minister in charge of responding to the crisis said on Tuesday. Nasser Yassin told Reuters the government response, helped by local initiatives and international aid, only covered 20% of the needs of 1.3 million people. Keir Starmer has accused Vladimir Putin of disrupting food supplies to Gaza after British intelligence suggested Russia had stepped up its attacks on Ukrainian ports. Starmer said it was clear the Russian president was \u201cwilling to gamble on global food security\u201d after several grain ships en route to developing countries were damaged by Russian strikes, and are believed to have delayed a vessel carrying vegetable oil destined for the World Food Programme in Palestine. The FBI is investigating the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel\u2019s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the Washington Post reported. \u201cThe FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,\u201d the FBI said in a statement.",

      "bodyText": "Too often we say an election is historically significant but, in the case of Queensland\u2019s state poll this Saturday, the Sunshine State really is at a crossroads. If the Liberal-National party wins office (as all public opinion polls over the past two years have indicated), it will be the conservatives\u2019 first election victory from the opposition benches in 13 years, and just the second in 67 years. That alone underscores the hegemonic nature of Queensland politics where governments can reign for decades. It\u2019s therefore little wonder that Labor \u2013 often endowed with popular leaders, a strong organisational substructure and regional-friendly infrastructure policy \u2013 should have governed Queensland for 30 of the past 35 years, and for 70 of the past 110. And while the looming defeat for the Labor government \u2013 looking tired after three terms, and now confronting \u201cyouth crime\u201d, the cost-of-living, ambulance \u201cramping\u201d, housing shortages and confusion over Olympic Games infrastructure \u2013 this campaign has nonetheless produced a number of remarkable phenomena. First, with youth crime (especially in north Queensland) dominating the political narrative, we\u2019ve not seen a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign since the 1980s when National party premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen ruled with an iron rod. Anecdotally, it appears voters are more concerned with locking up youth offenders than with cost-of-living relief. Second, despite the LNP gaining enormous traction over youth crime, the opposition has rolled itself into arguably the smallest policy target seen in a generation. While offering voter-friendly aspirations to improve the lot of Queenslanders in its first 100 days, the LNP has been so devoid of costed detail that even conservative stakeholders have voiced concern. Perhaps it\u2019s been Labor\u2019s pungent attacks on the LNP and its moderate leader, David Crisafulli, for that lack of detail that has produced a third remarkable development: a significant closing of the public opinion gap in the campaign\u2019s final days. Where a June-September Resolve Strategic poll pegged Labor\u2019s primary vote as low as 23%, and the LNP\u2019s after-preference vote as high as 58.5% (enough for Crisafulli to win 65 of the parliament\u2019s 93 seats), Resolve Strategic this week found Labor recovering to 32%, the LNP falling to 40% (with the Greens on 11, One Nation on 9, Katter on 2 and other on 6) for an after-preference split of 53 to 47 in the LNP\u2019s favour \u2013 a swing of 6% that would see the LNP just squeak into majority government. Just as remarkable is the recovery in voters\u2019 regard for the premier, Steven Miles \u2013 a softly spoken, self-confessed \u201cintroverted\u201d gym-junkie now presenting as a \u201cdaggy dad\u201d \u2013 whom Resolve Strategic now rates as behind as preferred premier on 37% to Crisafulli\u2019s 39%. Just months ago, Resolve Strategic found Miles, on 27%, trailing Crisafulli on 40%. Indeed, so robust has Miles\u2019s campaign been there\u2019s speculation he might stay on as opposition leader after Saturday. Such revivals underscore the power of a well-oiled campaign \u2013 as Labor\u2019s has been, especially via social media \u2013 to complement such election sweeteners as 50c public transport fares and free lunches for all state primary schoolchildren. But Labor\u2019s recovery also hinges on the question of the LNP potentially unwinding the state\u2019s popular abortion laws. Katter\u2019s Australian party recently pledged to introduce a private member\u2019s bill to repeal the 2018 legislation. It\u2019s a minor party move that would not ordinarily make headlines, except for the fact all but three of the LNP\u2019s then-parliamentary party, including Crisafulli and his deputy, Jarrod Bleijie, voted against removing abortion from the state\u2019s criminal code. Despite Crisafulli promising \u201cno change\u201d to abortion laws, questions are being asked of the LNP leader\u2019s ability quell a potential post-election rebellion among the party\u2019s conservative majority. A YouGov poll published last weekend, also suggesting a recovery for Miles, indicates Labor\u2019s primary vote, at 38%, is ahead of the LNP\u2019s 34% across Brisbane. There\u2019s little doubt fears over a potential repeal of abortion (and voluntary assisted dying) laws have dampened Crisafulli\u2019s appeal among moderate Brisbanites.

The investigation by the National Audit Office (NAO) found that despite record levels of spending there had been no signs of improvement in the lives of children with special educational needs (SEN). The report said local authorities were being forced towards insolvency by rising demand for special school places and \u201chigh-needs\u201d funding for specialists such as therapists, psychologists and teaching assistants. \u201cAlthough the Department for Education has increased high-needs funding, the SEN system is still not delivering for children and their families, and DfE\u2019s current actions are unlikely to resolve the challenges,\u201d said Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO. \u201cThe government has not yet identified a solution to manage local authority deficits arising from SEN costs, which ongoing savings programmes will not address.

Autism spectrum conditions are expected to see the fastest growth, after the number of children diagnosed in England\u2019s state schools shot up from 57,000 in 2015-16 to 132,000 last year. The report said there was no comprehensive explanation for the sharp increase in autism diagnoses but said factors included greater awareness of the condition and needs, \u201cpotentially accelerated\u201d by the impact of Covid, as well as incentives for schools to seek EHCPs for pupils in order to access high-needs funding. Education leaders and experts said the NAO report showed the system was in crisis, with responsibilities and costs heaped upon councils, schools and families. Tom Rees, chief executive of the Ormiston academies trust, said: \u201cThe NAO\u2019s report is more evidence of the urgent and overdue need for the SEN system to be reformed.

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves will announce at the International Monetary Fund a plan to change Britain\u2019s debt rules that will open the door for the government to spend up to \u00a350bn extra on infrastructure projects. After weeks of speculation, the chancellor will confirm at the fund\u2019s annual meetings in Washington on Thursday that next week\u2019s budget will include a new method for assessing the UK\u2019s debt position \u2013 a move that will permit the Treasury to borrow more for long-term capital investment. The change to the debt rule will be welcomed by the IMF, which says spending on UK infrastructure projects should be ringfenced as the government seeks to repair the damage to the public finances caused by the pandemic and the cost of living crisis. Reeves will not specify while in Washington which of the various debt measures under consideration has been chosen, but the Guardian has been told by a senior government source that she will target public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL). This yardstick \u2013 which will replace public sector net debt \u2013 will take into account all the government\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, including student loans and equity stakes in private companies, as well as funded pension schemes. This would give the chancellor room to increase borrowing for investment in long-term infrastructure. Reeves said before leaving for the IMF on Wednesday: \u201cA Britain built on the rock of economic stability is a Britain that is a strong and credible international partner. \u201cI\u2019ll be in Washington to tell the world that our upcoming budget will be a reset for our economy as we invest in the foundations of future growth. \u201cIt\u2019s from this solid base that we will be able to best represent British interests and show leadership on the major issues like the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\u201d Labour inherited a set of fiscal rules from Reeves\u2019s predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, dictating that day-to-day spending be met by revenues and that debt as a share of the economy must be falling in the fifth year of forecasts produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Hunt was only narrowly on course to meet his debt rule, by \u00a38.9bn, after announcing large tax cuts despite spending pressures linked to Britain\u2019s high debt servicing costs, ballooning demand on public services and weak economic growth. Had Hunt adopted a PSNFL target in March, it would have added about \u00a353bn to his borrowing headroom. The Treasury has hinted that it would not initially take advantage of all the extra scope that a change to the debt rule would provide and would put \u201cguard rails\u201d in place to ensure investment projects deliver value for money. Sources said energy and transport projects would be a particular focus of capital spending in the budget on 30 October. Reeves will not go for the most radical rule change by adopting the public sector net worth (PSNW) measure, which also includes non-financial assets such as the road network, schools and hospitals, sources said. The chancellor will say in the budget that the government\u2019s main fiscal rule will be that day-to-day spending should be covered by tax receipts, with borrowing used only for capital spending. The Treasury says this will mean tax increases and spending cuts of up to \u00a350bn. Announcing the changes at the IMF will signal that the chancellor is keeping a traditionally conservative body on board with her plans, while aiming to win over the world\u2019s most powerful finance ministers and central bankers. The push to minimise any reaction in financial markets from a change in the fiscal rules stands in stark contrast to the approach of Liz Truss, who was directly challenged by the fund over her mini-budget in 2022. A government source said that, while in Washington, Reeves would explain why she thought a change to the debt rule was needed but that full details would be provided in the budget. Speaking at a press conference to mark the latest release of the IMF\u2019s Fiscal Monitor publication, V\u00edtor Gaspar, director of its fiscal affairs department, said: \u201cAs in many other advanced economies, public investment [in the UK] as a percentage of GDP has been trending down. \u201cChallenges associated with the energy transition, new technologies, technological innovation and much else mean public investment is badly needed. \u201cThe Fiscal Monitor emphasises that public investment should be protected in budgetary procedures that foster sound macroeconomic performance. The fact that that issue is very much at the centre of the debate in the UK right now is very much welcome.\u201d The IMF has steadily shifted its stance in recent years to favour government borrowing for investment in the right circumstances.",

      "body": "<p>Tesla shares saw a 12% jump after the company reported its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The electric-car manufacturer was able to bounce back from a tough second quarter, beating Wall Street expectations for earnings per share. The company reported an earnings-per-share of $0.72, surpassing investors\u2019 projection of $0.60.</p> <p>At the end of the second quarter, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the nearly 50% drop in profits was temporary and due to difficulty competing with cheaper or price-slashed electric vehicles by rival companies such as BYD. \u201cWe don\u2019t see this as a long-term issue,\u201d Musk said in July, \u201cbut really fairly short term.\u201d</p> <p>Tesla came slightly under expected revenue, however.

      "bodyText": "Tesla shares saw a 12% jump after the company reported its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The electric-car manufacturer was able to bounce back from a tough second quarter, beating Wall Street expectations for earnings per share. The company reported an earnings-per-share of $0.72, surpassing investors\u2019 projection of $0.60. At the end of the second quarter, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the nearly 50% drop in profits was temporary and due to difficulty competing with cheaper or price-slashed electric vehicles by rival companies such as BYD. \u201cWe don\u2019t see this as a long-term issue,\u201d Musk said in July, \u201cbut really fairly short term.\u201d Tesla came slightly under expected revenue, however. The company reported $25.18bn in revenue at the end of the third quarter, just missing Wall Street revenue projections of $25.43bn. \u201cDespite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity,\u201d the company said in a press release. \u201cWe believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.\u201d On the earnings call on Wednesday, Musk said that Tesla had had a record third quarter and believes Tesla will become the most profitable company in the world if they execute on their plans. \u201cTesla is focused on the future of energy, transport, robotics and AI and this is a time where others are focused on just managing on near terms,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe think what we\u2019re doing is the right approach and if we execute on our objectives, and I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company in the world, probably by a long shot.\u201d At the moment, he says he doesn\u2019t know of any electric vehicle manufacturer that is currently profitable. Tesla delivered 462,890 vehicles at the end of the third quarter, up from 443,956 in the second quarter. Investors will be looking to hear more about whether the company is on track to match its 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8m.

The prime minister met with Liberal lawmakers in a closed-door caucus meeting on Wednesday where 20 MPs \u2013 none of them cabinet members \u2013 called on their leader to resign before a likely electoral drubbing in the next election. Two dozen lawmakers also signed a letter calling on Trudeau to make his decision by 28 October, but failed to give any clear consequence. There are 153 Liberal members of parliament, suggesting the mutiny still lacks widespread support. Although questions over Trudeau\u2019s political future are mounting, no alternative leader for the party has stepped forward to oppose him. In his ninth year as prime minister, Trudeau is deeply unpopular and facing calls within his party to step down to avoid an embarrassing electoral loss that could push the party to a distant third-place finish. The CBC Poll Tracker shows the Conservatives have a nearly 20-point lead over the governing Liberals. Two by-election results over the summer gave wary lawmakers even more reason to question Trudeau\u2019s future tenure as leader: the party lost the riding of LaSalle\u2013\u00c9mard\u2013Verdun, a district that had been held almost exclusively by Liberals for more than 50 years and months earlier lost a safe seat in downtown Toronto. The losses reflect a souring public opinion of Trudeau\u2019s government: the cost of living has surged alongside a housing shortage, and policy failures and mismanagement have eroded strong support for immigration. Trudeau has nonetheless said he intends to contest \u2013 and win \u2013 the next federal election, which would happen anytime before fall 2025. Leaving Wednesday\u2019s three-hour meeting, senior figures in cabinet reiterated their support for the embattled prime minister.

      "body": "<p>For a long time, football has heard the voice crying in the wilderness: make way for the coming of the regulator. This has been the hope that has sustained the rump of the game as the rich have disappeared further and further into the distance and clubs have been dragged further and further from their traditional communities. And now, with the launch on Thursday of the football governance bill, it feels a little realer, a little closer. This is actually happening.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/23/premier-league-stadium-sales-football-regulator\">as details emerge</a>, perhaps the most important thing to remember is that just because a regulator exists does not mean that regulations are followed, as the water industry demonstrates all too clearly. Far more important than any individual clause in the bill is what power the regulator will have in practice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/23/premier-league-stadium-sales-football-regulator\">Football regulator given power to block Premier League stadium sales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ticket prices, sustainability, fan representation and equality, diversity and inclusion within the game are important, as is the reduction or abolition of parachute payments, but equally none of the intentions matter much if the regulator lacks teeth. And even if the regulator is given significant power, it can only be as good as the people who run it. Perhaps experienced, intelligent, sensitive and strong-willed individuals do exist in football, but will the regulator be well&nbsp;enough funded to be able to afford them? Or is there a danger, as has happened in other industries, that those being regulated have deeper pockets than those doing the regulating and so can pick off the best people from the regulator?</p> <p>And this is the existential question facing the modern game: is it actually governable? It\u2019s true that some clubs have always been richer than others. But what is new is that modern owners, whether states, oligarchs or the wealthier private equity funds, have the financial might to bully football\u2019s administrators into submission. Might they even sue the regulator?</p> <p>The only way to stand up to financial power of that nature is through government intervention. So it\u2019s a terrible irony that Uefa and Fifa, the very bodies that have failed to tackle the related scourges of sportswashing and inequality, should explicitly outlaw government intervention.</p> <p>Attempting to keep politics and sport separate, trying for instance to prevent a sports ministry overriding a national federation to appoint the national coach with all the kickbacks that may entail, is a laudable aim. But intervening in issues of regulatory oversight plays into the hands of the very wealthy and already powerful. Only last month the Uefa general secretary, Theodore Theodoridis, wrote to the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, warning that England could theoretically be banned from Euro 2028, which it will co-host, should there be \u201cscope creep\u201d by a regulator into areas beyond \u201cthe long-term financial sustainability of clubs and heritage assets\u201d.</p> <p>This, it should be stressed, is not a government regulator but an independent body, albeit one set up by the government in the face of such concern from the Premier League that it has presented gifts worth more than \u00a3100,000 to MPs, including Keir Starmer and nine serving cabinet ministers, over the&nbsp;past three years.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/15/england-will-not-face-euros-expulsion-for-having-football-regulator-key-officials-say\">In reality the prospect of Uefa scuppering the financial viability of its prime international tournament is minimal</a>, but the threat suggested just how wary many within the football establishment are of regulation. Notably the clause about the regulator taking foreign and trade policy considerations into account in club takeovers has been removed from the bill, which should help to assuage Uefa\u2019s overt concerns, although it\u2019s baffling that was included anyway.</p> <p>While it\u2019s realistic to worry about the consequences if a nation with whom Britain has strained relations buys an English club, it\u2019s bewildering that English football should be expected to consider trade policy when deciding whether an owner is appropriate \u2013 even if it is now clear that Boris Johnson, when prime minister, actively supported the Saudi takeover of Newcastle United after being warned by Mohammed bin Salman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/saudis-asked-boris-johnson-to-intervene-in-newcastle-united-bid\">that blocking the deal could damage UK-Saudi relations</a>. The idea of an outside government interfering with the running of football seems not to exercise Uefa and Fifa.</p> <p>In any other era it would have sounded ridiculous. Edward Heath has helped the Shah\u2019s Iran buy Coventry City? What? And yet this is where we are. English football has become a stage on which global politics is played out. That, inevitably, has an impact on integrity \u2013 and sport without integrity is nothing.

      "bodyText": "For a long time, football has heard the voice crying in the wilderness: make way for the coming of the regulator. This has been the hope that has sustained the rump of the game as the rich have disappeared further and further into the distance and clubs have been dragged further and further from their traditional communities. And now, with the launch on Thursday of the football governance bill, it feels a little realer, a little closer. This is actually happening. But as details emerge, perhaps the most important thing to remember is that just because a regulator exists does not mean that regulations are followed, as the water industry demonstrates all too clearly. Far more important than any individual clause in the bill is what power the regulator will have in practice. Ticket prices, sustainability, fan representation and equality, diversity and inclusion within the game are important, as is the reduction or abolition of parachute payments, but equally none of the intentions matter much if the regulator lacks teeth. And even if the regulator is given significant power, it can only be as good as the people who run it. Perhaps experienced, intelligent, sensitive and strong-willed individuals do exist in football, but will the regulator be well enough funded to be able to afford them? Or is there a danger, as has happened in other industries, that those being regulated have deeper pockets than those doing the regulating and so can pick off the best people from the regulator? And this is the existential question facing the modern game: is it actually governable? It\u2019s true that some clubs have always been richer than others. But what is new is that modern owners, whether states, oligarchs or the wealthier private equity funds, have the financial might to bully football\u2019s administrators into submission. Might they even sue the regulator? The only way to stand up to financial power of that nature is through government intervention. So it\u2019s a terrible irony that Uefa and Fifa, the very bodies that have failed to tackle the related scourges of sportswashing and inequality, should explicitly outlaw government intervention. Attempting to keep politics and sport separate, trying for instance to prevent a sports ministry overriding a national federation to appoint the national coach with all the kickbacks that may entail, is a laudable aim. But intervening in issues of regulatory oversight plays into the hands of the very wealthy and already powerful. Only last month the Uefa general secretary, Theodore Theodoridis, wrote to the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, warning that England could theoretically be banned from Euro 2028, which it will co-host, should there be \u201cscope creep\u201d by a regulator into areas beyond \u201cthe long-term financial sustainability of clubs and heritage assets\u201d. This, it should be stressed, is not a government regulator but an independent body, albeit one set up by the government in the face of such concern from the Premier League that it has presented gifts worth more than \u00a3100,000 to MPs, including Keir Starmer and nine serving cabinet ministers, over the past three years. In reality the prospect of Uefa scuppering the financial viability of its prime international tournament is minimal, but the threat suggested just how wary many within the football establishment are of regulation. Notably the clause about the regulator taking foreign and trade policy considerations into account in club takeovers has been removed from the bill, which should help to assuage Uefa\u2019s overt concerns, although it\u2019s baffling that was included anyway. While it\u2019s realistic to worry about the consequences if a nation with whom Britain has strained relations buys an English club, it\u2019s bewildering that English football should be expected to consider trade policy when deciding whether an owner is appropriate \u2013 even if it is now clear that Boris Johnson, when prime minister, actively supported the Saudi takeover of Newcastle United after being warned by Mohammed bin Salman that blocking the deal could damage UK-Saudi relations. The idea of an outside government interfering with the running of football seems not to exercise Uefa and Fifa. In any other era it would have sounded ridiculous. Edward Heath has helped the Shah\u2019s Iran buy Coventry City? What? And yet this is where we are. English football has become a stage on which global politics is played out. That, inevitably, has an impact on integrity \u2013 and sport without integrity is nothing. It\u2019s not just the Saudis, Johnson and Newcastle. A freedom of information request a year ago showed that the UK government had been in contact with the British embassy in Abu Dhabi to discuss the potential fallout of the Premier League charges against Manchester City, but the emails were withheld on the grounds that their release could be prejudicial to the UK\u2019s relationship with the UAE. These are enormous issues, beyond the scope of the football authorities. The truth is, they\u2019re likely to be beyond the scope of a regulator. If the regulator actually does have the remit and resources to begin to address issues such as ticket pricing and sustainability, then it is to be welcomed. A regulator is at least a focal point for resistance and potential action, and should be free of the institutional self-interest that so often blights football. But nobody should think a regulator is a panacea. And, frankly, in terms of the biggest issue facing the game, that of ungovernable wealth, it may already be too late.",

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for joining. What a fun set of games. Until we meet again. And the man himself, Sid Lowe, was in Barcelona. Andy Hunter was in Leipzig. Jamie Jackson was at the Etihad. Ed Aarons is in Istanbul with Erik ten Hag because I was too committed to this live blog. David came off the bench to score two vital goals on a fine night for Lille. A cracking performance from Feyenoord in Lisbon. Barcelona very good, Bayern Munich woeful. Milambo puts the result beyond doubt with a sweeping finish. Heartbreak for the Swiss side. Nunez\u2019s goal is enough for the Reds. Another terrible night for Pep Ljinders. Another memorable night for Lille. David shoots from six yards, it takes a huge deflection and Lille look set to follow up their win over Real Madrid with one at Atletico. HUGE! A late, late winner for Inter as the Frenchman turns home from close range. Job done and more for City. We will be talking about Haaland\u2019s first for a while. Atletico Madrid 1-2 Lille: An incredible block on the line keeps Lille ahead. Blackburn 0-0 West Brom Hull 1-1 Burnley Luton 1-2 Sunderland Millwall 1-0 Plymouth Nunes is taken down in the box. The Portuguese midfielder steps up and sends the goalkeeper the wrong way. Game over in Austria. Petkovic doubles the lead with a fine finish. NO GOAL! RB Leipzig 0-1 Liverpool: Openda taps home at the back post but he is offside. Haaland = competent. Manchester City 4-0 Sparta Prague: Haaland is withdrawn with 10 minutes to go. O\u2019Reilly is sent on in his place for a Champions League debut. Straight down the middle from the spot! RB Salzburg 0-1 Dinamo Zagreb: RED CARD! Goalkeeper Schlager comes out of his area, colliding with a centre-back and striker. He manages to get up briefly and decides to make a save when a few yards out of his box, leading to him being sent off. Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu pounces after a shot is parried in his direction to reduce the deficit. Manchester City 4-0 Sparta Prague: Guardiola brings on Kovacic and McAtee. Gundogan and Silva off. City break up the pitch, concluding with Nunes slipping a pass to Haaland who picks his spot. Zhegrova takes aim from just outside the box, it takes a deflection and ends up in the corner. OOOOOOOF! Nunes whips in a cross and Stones perfectly directs it into the top corner. Benfica 0-2 Feyenoord: NO GOAL! Trauner taps in a rebound but he is offside. Barcelona 4-1 Bayern Munich: Kompany makes a quadruple change. I am not sure that will sort anything. Lamine Yamal produces a cracking pass to find the Brazilian, he takes it on the chest and sprints into the box before slamming a shot into the corner. Bayern\u2019s defending is woeful. GOAL! Manchester City 2-0 Sparta Prague: I need to take a second to work out how to describe it. Savinho does well to get to the byline before chipping a cross to the near post where Haaland leaps into the air and backheels it in. Absolutely incredible. WHAT A FINISH! Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague: Savinho picks out Haaland in the box, everyone seems to think the striker will head home but the goalkeeper makes a fine save. Benfica 0-2 Feyenoord: John Doxey is emotional: \u201cSitting here in my Manchester student accoms nearly in tears at how well Feyenoord are playing. Brian Priske\u2019s been criticised a lot since taking over from Slot but tonight his plan is working brilliantly. Simply glorious!\u201d Barcelona 3-1 Bayern Munich: K\u00e1ri Tulinius emails: \u201cThe defensive organisation of Kompany\u2019s Bayern is so weird. I get they\u2019re trying to set up a W shape as a way to stop counterattacks, but putting Upamecano at the middle top of that W makes no sense. He\u2019s a great defender, but you want him stopping the attack from the back, not running frantically towards his own goal. That said, the whole of the Bayern defence has been in poor form for at least the past two seasons, so maybe Kompany is trying to patch things together, but hasn\u2019t found a solution yet.\u201d Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague: The hosts are still working on securing a vital second goal, which might help Guardiola to start making changes. Young Boys 0-0 Internazionale: PENALTY SAVE! Arnautovic sends the ball to the goalkeeper\u2019s left but it is a smart stop from Von Ballmoos. Kulenovi\u0107 finds the bottom corner. NO GOAL! Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague: An inswinging corner is flicked to the back post where Haaland is waiting, he knocks it back across goal and Ake finishes from a yard out but VAR rules it out after spotting a handball from the Dutchman. You can join Rob Smyth for some pure Liverpool reporting. Not bad \u2026 Half-time reading \u2026 Atletico Madrid 1-0 Lille Barcelona 3-1 Bayern Munich Benfica 0-2 Feyenoord Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague RB Leipzig 0-1 Liverpool RB Salzburg 0-0 Dinamo Zagreb Young Boys 0-0 Internazionale Barcelona 3-1 Bayern Munich: The Bayern defence does remind me of Burnley\u2019s last season. Kompany really has not learned anything. A crossfield pass finds Raphinha on the left wing, he drives for the box and curls the ball beyond Neuer. Barcelona 2-1 Bayern Munich: It is end-to-end stuff at Catalonia. I am not sure either side know exactly how to defend. Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague: Nunes crosses the ball and it is blocked by Vitik. The City midfielder seems to think it is worth of a penalty but it is the worst claim for handball I have ever seen. Foden takes a shot from 20 yards but it flashes wide. Kim fails to deal with a high ball, Fermin Lopez nips in, Neuer comes to close him down but the midfielder lays the ball on a plate for Lewandowski to tap into an empty net. VAR checks to see if Fermin Lopez has pushed Kim in the back but says there is no offence. Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague: Savinho cuts in from the right and beats a couple of defends. He eventually finds enough space to shoot but drags his shot wide. Half-time Championship scores: Blackburn 0-0 West Brom Hull 1-0 Burnley Luton 0-0 Sunderland Millwall 1-0 Plymouth What a performance from Feyenoord this has been. Milambo bundles his way through the Benfica defence and then thrashes the ball home. Barcelona 1-1 Bayern Munich: CLOSE! The Germans pass it around in their own box but it almost ends in disaster when Neuer kicks it straight at Lamine Yamal. The goalkeeper looks mightily relieved as the ball bounces wide. Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague: Ortega is forced into a decent save as Sparta enjoy a good few moments and put City under pressure. Salah heads a cross towards the corner, it looks like it is going in but Nunez makes sure on the line. NO GOAL! Benfica 0-1 Feyenoord: The goalkeeper makes two saves in quick succession but Ayase pounces to score from close range. VAR checks and spots a foul in the buildup, causing the ref to ruling it out. \u201cSpeaking of professors, I have to point out that Julian is wrong: the anagram would come out the slightly scatological Nun will wi. Frankly, I always assumed that they did,\u201d says Adrian Goldman, PhD, FRSB. Bayern have been on top for a long time and this one will not be ruled out. Gnabry finds Kane in the box, allowing him to volley home from six yards. RB Leipzig 0-0 Liverpool: Kelleher comes 30 yards out of his goal and fails to deal with the situation. Sesko picks up the ball and takes aim for the empty net but misses the target. Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague: The hosts have had 81% possession thus far. Ewan Murray was in Bergamo to watch Celtic earn a point. Here is his report. The striker sidefoots a first-time shot into the corner from a pullback. NO GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Bayern Munich: Bayern go from one end of the pitch to the other, ending with a great cross that Kane heads home but the England striker is offside and VAR rules the goal out. Alvarez gives the hosts the lead. Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague: Haaland leaps a good four feet into the air and sends a header towards the corner but Vindahl produces a world class save to keep it out. Atletico Madrid 0-0 Lille: Sorloth breaks through the Lille defence and is one-on-one with the goalkeeper but his shot from six yards out is shanked out for a throw-in. Quite impressive, in a way. Manchester City 1-0 Sparta Prague: Funnily enough, I can\u2019t see Sparta getting back into this. City are in complete control. Stones gets a booking for a mistimed challenge on the halfway line. The Brazilian is sent through on goal, he goes around the goalkeeper and slots home. The midfielder receives the ball around 22 yards from goal, spins and takes aim for the bottom corner. Manchester City 0-0 Sparta Prague: I feel Sparta will be looking to be direct and turn City\u2019s defence. They have what looks like a flat back five at the moment. The whistles are peeping around Europe. \u201cI had a little smile reading the team sheet for Man City and your mention of two goalies on the subs bench,\u201d writes Tim Smith. \u201cDoes Scott Carson not have the very best job in football? I mean, what are the chances of facing a shot in anger. Thinking further, he may have the best job/career ever.\u201d Yes he does. TNT have sent Andy Brassell to Barcelona. What a gig for the great man. The points are also shared in France. Celtic hold on for a point after having their backs to the wall in injury-time. It feels like a fair result. Julian Scott Yeomans, who claims to be a professor, emails: \u201cI believe that the gauntlet has now been thrown down. In response to Peter Oh\u2019s seven-year-olds\u2019 question of \u201cwho will unwin?\u201d and not wishing to provoke an entire session devoted to your name, but a sufficiently juvenile response to his question is use an anagram of Will Unwin to reply that \u201cnun will win\u201d.\u201d Atalanta 0-0 Celtic: Four minutes added on. Atalanta 0-0 Celtic: Rodgers\u2019 side are currently looking relatively comfortable in Bergamo. They are defending well and creating a chance or two. Peter Oh emails acting like some of the seven-year-olds I was at school with: \u201cAfter Borussia Dortmund\u2019s entertaining second-half implosion at Real Madrid yesterday, the question to you, Will Unwin, is, who will unwin today?\u201d I will say \u2026 Lille. I should say we have five Championship fixtures this evening. Blackburn v West Brom Hull v Burnley Luton v Sunderland Millwall v Plymouth Middlesbrough v Sheffield United Atalanta 0-0 Celtic: De Roon has a shot from just outside the area but Schmeichel is equal to it. If you want RB Leipzig v Liverpool then Rob Smyth has you covered. City make the bold decision to name seven subs, including two goalkeepers. Whoever designed this scarf was very lazy. I think they could have been a touch more original than \u2018Come On You Blues\u2019 and Haaland. Half time scores in the early games: Atalanta 0-0 Celtic Brest 1-1 Bayer Leverkusen I am so committed to this blog that I went to hang out at the hotel where Sparta Prague are staying in Manchester earlier today. I found out that 21-year-old Martin Vit\u00edk is the man to watch. The centre-back has a big future and we can expect him to move to one of the big five leagues in Europe in the coming years. Tonight he will most likely be up against Erling Haaland to add to his education. Get your Manchester City pre-match reading material. There are a few fun fixtures around this evening.

And the more games UEFA can fit into the calendar the better, right? Surely only a matter of time before the final is played on 4th July in New York at 8pm (Eastern time).\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve enjoyed it and particularly Villa, though I think that\u2019s more because of their newness than the format. My main gripe is the extra games; it\u2019ll never happen but a way to make the league stage <em>really </em>interesting would be to have 12 teams qualifying rather than 24. The top four go straight to the quarters, the next eight playoff to join them.

      "bodyText": "Andy Hunter\u2019s match report is in, so it\u2019s time to wrap things up. Thanks for your company - goodnight! In other news, Erling Haaland scored a unique goal \u2013 good luck trying to describe it \u2013 in Manchester City\u2019s 5-0 win over Sparta Prague. The Champions League table is taking shape, and the top end looks a lot like the Premier League. \u201cMalcolm Macdonald once ran the 100 metres in 10.9 seconds on 70s and 80s TV staple Superstars,\u201d says Simon McMahon, \u201cfaster I\u2019m sure than fellow Superstar Geoff Capes, Olympic shot putter, twice World\u2019s Strongest Man, Highland Games champion and former President of the Budgerigar Society, who has sadly died today, bringing back childhood memories of Brian Jacks, Lynn Davies, Kevin Keegan, Daley Thompson, John Conteh, Jackie Stewart, Tony Jacklin\u2026 \u201cCan you imagine that today? Jude Bellingham, Lewis Hamilton, Tommy Fleetwood, Tyson Fury riding bikes and doing squat thrusts on a Wednesday night on Channel 5. I\u2019d watch.\u201d Are you sure he didn\u2019t let someone else run the first 98 metres and then charge over the line with his hands in the air? The Slot machine spits out another three points. Darwin Nunez\u2019s first-half goal has given Liverpool a deserved victory in Leipzig, one that takes them to second in the fledgling Champions League table. It was a strong Liverpool performance overall, even if they needed Caiomhin Kelleher to make three difficult saves in the second half. Both keepers played well and were it not for Peter Gulacsi, Liverpool might have been out of sight by half-time. That\u2019s 11 win 12 games under Arne Slot, including six out of six away from home. Pretty, pretty good. 90+3 min Diaz\u2019s wobbling shot from the edge of the area isn\u2019t held by Gulacsi, but he gets away with it. 90+1 min Baumgartner puts Openda right through on goal with a glorious pass. Openda inexplicably declines to shoot, tries to square the ball to Poulsen and makes a mess of that as well. It was a dreadful pass, well behind Poulsen, though as it transpired Openda was again offside. He\u2019s missed the chance to complete his hat-trick! 90 min Liverpool are five added minutes away from their 11th victory in 12 games under Arne Slot. 89 min Gakpo cuts inside from the left and scorches a rising drive that is tipped over one-handed by Gulacsi, leaping to his left. Excellent save. 87 min \u201cIf Openda gets a third disallowed goal,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cthen Liverpool will probably sign him.\u201d 85 min: Leipzig substitution Eljif Elmas replaces the impressive Amadou Haidara. Time to go for broke. 84 min It feels like Liverpool have been comfortable for most of the game, yet Caoimhin Kelleher has made three vital saves in the second half. I guess it\u2019s because Leipzig have played in moments; at no stage have they had Liverpool under sustained pressure. Henrichs did brilliantly, collecting Konate\u2019s headed clearance before surging round the outside of the Liverpool defence. Then he struck a fierce cross-shot that was pushed away superbly by Kelleher. Openda had an open goal but he had gone too soon and was clearly offside. 83 min: Openda has another goal disallowed! 81 min Szoboszlai\u2019s sweet chest-volley is well blocked by Bitshiabu. 80 min One impressive thing about Liverpool under Arne Slot is their ability to manage the tempo of a game. They still have the capacity to overwhelm teams in a five- or ten-minute period but they can also slow things down and keep the opposition at arm\u2019s length. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing right now. 78 min: Another Leipzig substitution Yussuf Poulsen replaces Xavi Simons, who appears to have turned his ankle and needs help leaving the field. 77 min Gakpo has gone to centre forward for Liverpool, with Diaz on the left and Szoboszlai (I think) playing from the right. Gakpo belts over the bar from distance. 75 min: Triple substitution for Liverpool Andy Robertson, Joe Gomez and the in-form Curtis Jones come on for Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kostas Tsimikas and the excellent Darwin Nunez. 74 min: Triple substitution for Leipzig Christoph Baumgartner, Kevin Kampl and El Chadaille Bitshiabu replace Arthur Vermeeren, Benjamin Sesko and Lutsharel Geertruida. 73 min: Another good save by Kelleher! Simons\u2019 shot from the edge of the area takes a nasty deflection and loops over the head of Kelleher, who jumps backward to tip it over the bar. The first save was the better of the two but it was another piece of excellent, assured goalkeeping. 72 min: Fine save by Kelleher! Leipzig almost equalise out of nothing. Konate lost the ball in a dangerous area to Haidara, whose tackle diverted the ball to Simons. He moved the edge of the area and played an angled pass to Sesko, whose low shot was kicked away by Kelleher. Excellent reflexes. 70 min: Mac Allister hits the bar! Lovely play from Liverpool. Mac Allister plays a nice pass to Szoboszlai, who drags his studs over the ball to return it to Mac Allister. He curls a fine shot from 25 yards that beats Gulacsi and hits the top of the bar. 68 min Openda gets behind Konate on the left side of the area, chops back outside onto his right foot and hits a shot that deflects off Konate and spins not far over the bar. The flag then goes up against Openda, though the replay suggested he might have been onside. 66 min Nunez receives a short pass from Gakpo on the edge of the area, opens his body and pings an awkward, dipping shot that Gulacsi saves at the second attempt. 63 min: Liverpool substitution Luis Diaz replaces Mo Salah, who isn\u2019t happy about being taken off. Liverpool visit Arsenal on Sunday, hence the management of his minutes. 62 min In other news, Barcelona lead Bayern Munich 4-1 thanks to a hat-trick from Robert Lewand- Raphinha. The Barcelona team includes four 21-year-old and two 17-year-olds. Is something brilliant happening? 60 min \u201cThe travesty of the Champions League is not the format,\u201d says Krishnamoorthy V, \u201cbut the fact that you mislead so many teams about winning this trophy which is then collected by Real Madrid come May. (Doubters may please talk with BVB Dortmund.)\u201d The format doesn\u2019t make football any more undemocratic, does it? Please don\u2019t make me shout at that cloud again. 59 min Salah controls a crossfield pass, shuffles infield and wafts a trademark curler over the bar from 20 yards. Liverpool look very comfortable at the moment. 58 min As things stand \u2013 I know, I know \u2013 Liverpool are second in the Champions League table, behind Aston Villa on goal difference. A 2-0 win would send them top. 57 min \u201cI reckon K\u00e1ri Tulinius is onto something with a fully Swiss-system Champions League,\u201d writes Andy Flintoff. \u201cWe just need a venue which has 16 pitches in close proximity, such as Hackney Marshes, and each round could be held there. Solves the logistics instantly (aside from about a million fans descending on East London every week). Do the same in two other locations for the Europa League and the Conference League. Or you could rotate between the three venues each matchday. \u201cPS I am not mad.\u201d Couldn\u2019t we just play the whole thing on Football Manager? 56 min A fierce long-range shot from Henrichs hits Mac Allister flush in the masculinity. That looks seriously painful, and he\u2019s lying on his back receiving treatment. Not sure you can really treat that; he just needs a bit of time to get his breath back. 54 min Alexander-Arnold farts around near the byline and is dispossessed by Simons. The attack peters out but Simons continues to look Leipzig\u2019s biggest threat. Aside from one spectacular effort apiece, Openda and Sesko have been quiet. 51 min \u201cWill Darwin\u2019s strike mean survival of the fittest\u201d wonders Peter Oh. \u201cOr will Red Bull roar back and ensure survival of the fizziest?\u201d Hang on, Red Bull is fizzy? I am so out of touch, I don\u2019t even know which one\u2019s Dec. 50 min Good defending from Gravenberch, who slides to concede a corner and stop Simons\u2019 low cross reaching Sesko in the middle. Van Dijk embraces him like a goalscorer. 49 min: Big save by Gulacsi! Nunez goes after another lost cause, this time down the right. He screws a cutback that is cut out at the near post, only for Vermeeren and Geertruida to make a complete Horlicks of the situation and present the ball to Gakpo six yards out. His shot is stopped by the outstretched right leg of Gulacsi. 49 min A scruffy start to the second half, nothing to report except that there\u2019s nothing to report. 47 min \u201cJust looked up Malcolm Macdonald\u2019s career stats, mighty impressive they are too,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cAnd he was outstanding in A Clockwork Orange.\u201d Ah, a bit of the old ultrabanter. 46 min Peep peep! Leipzig begin the second half. \u201cNot to get into the weeds, I say while getting into the weeds, but Uefa chose to use a Pots System rather than a Swiss System,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cIf it were truly a Swiss System, then teams would face an opponent with the same number of points, or as close to as possible, each round. It would ensure a lot more matches between the big clubs, and fewer meet-ups between sharks and minnows. Of course, that would mean more actual jeopardy, so that won\u2019t happen, unless UEFA does a bait and switch next year and says the clubs had agreed to a Swiss System, so there. It would be logistically difficult, but a lot more fun to watch.\u201d Half-time reading Liverpool started slowly and looked susceptible to counter-attacks, but Darwin Nunez\u2019s 27th-minute goal, nicked from Mo Salah, changed the game. It was one-way traffic after that: Peter Gulacsi saved brilliantly from Nunez, who might* have had a penalty after a dodgy tackle from Willi Orban, and the impressive Cody Gakpo flashed a shot just wide. * Edit: should have had a penalty. We\u2019ve just seen a few replays and it looked a clear foul. 45 min \u201cGlad to see Nunez bring his traditional touch of chaos to Salah\u2019s effort,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cStealing goals is a dangerous game. I have rarely found anything on a football pitch funnier than Nani trying to steal Ronaldo\u2019s goal against Spain, only to be flagged offside. Ronaldo \u2018scored\u2019 an outrageous outside-of-the-boot chip from a preposterous position, and Nani sauntered in to ruin it. Cue the Look Of Death. Magnificent stuff.\u201d Oh yes! Had totally forgotten that. Ronaldo\u2019s reaction is marvellous. 44 min Gakpo moves infield with purpose, gives the ball to Szoboszlai and makes for the penalty area. Szoboszlai plays a cute return pass and Gakpo sweeps a first-time shot just wide from about 15 yards. He\u2019s been full of menace. 43 min Haidara\u2019s deflected long-range shot is held comfortably by Kelleher, diving to his right. 41 min Football is rarely dull when Darwin Nunez is on the pitch. He\u2019s been a persistent pain in Leipzig\u2019s derriere in the last 20 minutes or so, and the penalty appeal came from a typically determined pursuit of an apparently lost cause. Everyone, including Orban, thought the ball was going behind for a goalkick. 40 min Leipzig are hanging on to a 1-0 deficit. A very dangerous cross towards Nunez is cleared either brilliantly or fortuitously by Orban, who was facing his own goal and pulled down a ball that came towards him at a very awkward height. 39 min: No penalty Hmm, Orban\u2019s a bit fortunate there. Nunez definitely got to the ball first and, though he was happy to run into Orban\u2019s leg, ultimately he didn\u2019t initiate the contact. We\u2019ve only seen one replay though. 38 min Nunez goes flying in the area after scooting past Orban near the byline. The referee isn\u2019t interested but this may well be overturned by VAR. 37 min Tsimikas\u2019s corner from the right is met at the near post by Van Dijk, whose header is tipped over by Gulacsi. That was a more comfortable save than the one from Nunez. 36 min Liverpool have been well on top since the goal. Alexander-Arnold receives possession 25 yards from goal, walks past a defender and rakes a shot that deflects behind for a corner. 34 min \u201cThis might be too old for most of your readers,\u201d says Espen Bommen, \u201cbut that\u2019s a Malcolm Macdonald goal from Nunez if I\u2019ve ever seen one.\u201d 32 min: Terrific save by Gulacsi! Alexander-Arnold sprays an effortless crossfield pass out to the increasingly influential Gakpo. He flicks a lovely cross towards Nunez, whose powerful close-range header is tipped over acrobatically by Gulacsi; that\u2019s a brilliant reaction save. 29 min Imagine if Nunez had been offside though. Nunez has achieved what Craig Johnston couldn\u2019t quite manage in the 1986 FA Cup final. Liverpool won\u2019t care as it was a well-worked goal. Gakpo combined nicely with the underlapping Tsimikas, who stood up a good cross towards the far. Salah strained his neck muscles to power a head back across goal and Nunez made sure on the line. I\u2019m 99 per cent sure it would have gone in off the inside of the post, but I guess Nunez needs the goal more than Salah. Darwin Nunez has stolen a goal from Mo Salah! 26 min: Disallowed goal! Openda beats Kelleher with a spectacular rising drive on the turn\u2026 and then the flag goes up. He was miles offside in fairness. Just before that Konate made another important intervention, this time to dispossess Sesko just outisde the area. He\u2019s been excellent. 25 min \u201cI remember the Champions League group stages coming in during the nineties including the few seasons where they had back to back group stages. The joy of the European Cup prior to this, was that the two-legged ties were filled with jeopardy. It did, of course mean that big clubs or star players could exit the competition early doors (I\u2019m thinking Maradona\u2019s Napoli). But it was worth it for the fact that every game was meaningful. Amusingly the response to the general indifference created by the group stages has been to bloat the thing even further. It\u2019s like asking Noel Gallagher to correct the excesses of Be Here Now by taking more cocaine.\u201d Arf. While I\u2019d love to go back to unseeded jeopardy, I\u2019ve given up shouting at this particular cloud. I mean look at it. 23 min Leipzig remind me a little of the Romania side of 1994 in that they\u2019re like a coiled spring, always on the lookout for counter-attacks. So far, for all Liverpool\u2019s possession, Leipzig have carried the greater threat. 22 min Geertruida is booked for a hack at Gakpo. 20 min At the other end Salah pokes wide of the near post. It wasn\u2019t really a chance, though it is Liverpool\u2019s first attempt at goal. 19 min: Just wide from Sesko! A fantastic effort from the big man. Kelleher came out of his area to head the ball away but didn\u2019t get enough on it to concede a throw-in. Sesko collected by the left touchline, turned and hit an extravagant curling shot just wide of the far post. Kelleher was still running back towards goal and would have had no chance. That was almost a glorious goal. 16 min Leipzig have had only 35 per cent possession but all three attempts at goal. So now you know. 15 min Here\u2019s more on Celtic\u2019s impressive, hard-fought draw in Bergamo. 14 min The corner is half cleared and Leipzig come again. The ball is screwed back to the edge of the D, where Haidara hits a sweet first-time shot with his left foot. Kelleher gets down smartly to his left to make a confident save. Moments later, Sesko gets behind Liverpool on the right side of the area but cuts the ball behind the man in the middle. 13 min Haidara plays a quick pass through to Openda, who tries to go past Konate in the area and gets no change. The assistant gives a corner, a decision with which Konate is less than thrilled. 13 min Mac Allister is booked for diving. Looked like a foul to me, but I haven\u2019t got the whistle. 12 min There have been two early goals in the match between Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Will Unwin will give you chapter and verse. 10 min Leipzig are full of intent on the counter attack, charging forward as soon as they win the ball. Nunez runs the channel to win Liverpool\u2019s first corner. Tsinikas takes it and Orban heads away well under pressure. 8 min Castello Lukeba is booked for standing on Szoboszlai\u2019s foot. 7 min Simons cuts inside from the left and curls a nice cross towards Sesko, who flicks a header straight at Kelleher. It was a tough chance because he had to generate power while also trying to place it in the corner. 4 min Liverpool have taken the centre of the ring early on, moving the ball around with a relaxed confidence. Nunez finds Gakpo on the left; he beats his man but overhits a cross towards the unmarked Salah at the far post. 2 min Simons curls over from the edge of the area after a promising Leipzig break, sparked by a loose touch from Tsimikas near the halfway line. It looks like Leipzig have started with a back four by the way; Henrichs is at left-back. Leipzig (4-3-2-1) Gulacsi; Geertruida, Orban, Lukeba, Henrichs; Haidara, Vermeeren, Nusa; Sesko, Simons; Openda. 1 min And they\u2019re off. Liverpool are kicking from left to right as we watch. A reminder of the teams Leipzig (possible 3-4-2-1) Gulacsi; Geertruida, Orban, Lukeba; Henrichs, Haidara, Vermeeren, Nusa; Simons, Sesko; Openda. Substitutes: Vandevoordt, Bitshiabu, Elmas, Poulsen, Baumgartner, Andre Silva, Kampl, Gebel. Liverpool (4-3-3) Kelleher; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk, Tsimikas; Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Nunez, Gakpo. Substitutes: Jaros, Gomez, Endo, Diaz, Jones, Robertson, Quansah, Morton, Nyoni, Davies. Referee Sandro Scharer (Switzerland) Leipzig are second in the Bundesliga, behind Bayern on goal difference. Like Liverpool they\u2019ve been superb in defence, concedingly only twice in seven games. But it hasn\u2019t worked out quite so well in the Champions League: they lost 2-1 to Atletico Madrid and 3-2 to Juventus, having been ahead in both games. Another defeat tonight and they\u2019ll be needing snookers. \u201c\ufeffSo, Rob, what\u2019s your verdict so far on the Swiss Model?\u201d asks Simon McMahon. \u201cLoath as I am to give UEFA credit for anything, if nothing else it\u2019s mixed things up a bit, and given teams like, say, Aston Villa, Brest and Slovan Bratislava top billing, at least for a while. \u201cNo doubt the last 16 will look pretty familiar, and Real Madrid will beat Man City in the final anyway, but it feels like the chances of an outsider, or maybe even two, making the latter stages have increased. And the more games UEFA can fit into the calendar the better, right? Surely only a matter of time before the final is played on 4th July in New York at 8pm (Eastern time).\u201d I\u2019ve enjoyed it and particularly Villa, though I think that\u2019s more because of their newness than the format. My main gripe is the extra games; it\u2019ll never happen but a way to make the league stage really interesting would be to have 12 teams qualifying rather than 24. The top four go straight to the quarters, the next eight playoff to join them. That would mean fewer games and loads more jeopardy, which is frankly how I prefer to roll. The two early games were both drawn. That\u2019s a fine result for Celtic, especially after their humiliation in Dortmund last time out. Atalanta 0-0 Celtic Brest 1-1 Leverkusen And this is the updates Champions League table. Liverpool and Benfica, who play Feyenoord, can both go top tonight. Ibrahima Konate is the only player on either side who\u2019s on a yellow card. If he\u2019s booked tonight he\u2019ll miss Leverkusen at home in a fortnight. Pre-match bits and bobs Arne Slot makes three changes from Sunday\u2019s win over Chelsea. Andy Robertson and Curtis Jones are rested, with Kostas Tsimikas and Alexis Mac Allister coming into the side. Darwin Nunez replaces the injured Diogo Jota up front and Cody Gakpo is again preferred to Luis Diaz. Plenty of familiar names in the Leipzig team, including Benjamin Sesko and Xavi Simons, but they are without the Germany international Lukas Klostermann in defence. Leipzig (possible 3-4-2-1) Gulacsi; Geertruida, Orban, Lukeba; Henrichs, Haidara, Vermeeren, Nusa; Simons, Sesko; Openda. Substitutes: Vandevoordt, Bitshiabu, Elmas, Poulsen, Baumgartner, Andre Silva, Kampl, Gebel. Liverpool (4-3-3) Kelleher; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk, Tsimikas; Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Nunez, Gakpo. Substitutes: Jaros, Gomez, Endo, Diaz, Jones, Robertson, Quansah, Morton, Nyoni, Davies. Referee Sandro Scharer (Switzerland) There are loads of other Champions League games tonight, including Barcelona v Bayern Munich. Will Unwin has drawn the Clockwatch straw. Hello, good evening and welcome to live coverage of Leipzig v Liverpool at the Red Bull Arena. You win nothing in October, unless it\u2019s 1988 and the Mercantile Credit Cententary Trophy is up for grabs, but there\u2019s never a bad time to be top of the league. If Liverpool win tonight, and other results that would not stretch credulity go their way, they will be top in both England and Europe. For now it still feels strange to talk about teams being top of the Champions League. That\u2019ll soon pass \u2013 group stages were weird once \u2013 and the new competition is starting to take shape. The league stage is essentially a giant game of snakes and ladders and Liverpool would love to get to nine points ahead of the toughest bit of their fixture list: Leverkusen and Real Madrid at Anfield. Kick off 8pm.",

      "bodyText": "In the goalfest that is Erling Haaland\u2019s remarkable career, the reverse-flick while airborne that beat Peter Vindahl while facing away from Sparta Prague\u2019s goalkeeper is surely a glittering standout. It was Manchester City\u2019s second, coming on 58 minutes, and Haaland\u2019s nonchalant, whadda-you-expect grin illustrated just how impressed he was with his own work. Asked if the 24-year-old\u2019s strike was normal, Pep Guardiola said: \u201cFor a human being I would say not. It\u2019s unbelievable. He made an incredible goal, similar to [against Borussia] Dortmund a few years ago. I don\u2019t know which one is more difficult but I would say both [are equal].\u201d City now have seven points and \u2013 as Opta\u2019s \u201csupercomputer\u201d calculates nine should secure progress to the playoff round, and 15 to the last 16 \u2013 Guardiola\u2019s relentless team are in cruise control. On Tuesday Guardiola said Phil Foden \u201cwill be back soon\u201d \u2013 meaning to his finest \u2013 and he started here by gliding past three Sparta players and sweeping the opener into the left corner, his wand of a left foot beating Vindahl from 18 yards or so. John Stones and Manuel Akanji knitted the play for the midfielder\u2019s strike. Soon after they were backpedalling as Sparta broke along the right where Veljko Birmancevic had a shot blocked. Lars Friis\u2019s men hoped to prosper on the breakaway, but had to be ruthless to do so. Haaland is the master when it comes to ruthlessness and, on leaping to meet a cross from the left and heading down to Vindahl\u2019s right, thought he had doubled the score. The effort drew a gasp followed by a louder exhortation as the goalkeeper, Gordon Banks-like, dived to his right to scoop the ball to safety from under the bar. Sparta\u2019s packed away end pogoed despite how City looked to eviscerate their side via 81% possession and the travelling faithful\u2019s party nearly ratcheted up when Victor Olatunji raced into enemy territory. The forward sent a chip over Stefan Ortega but it was too high. Guardiola, resplendent in a natty woollen turtleneck, was at his usual technical area station. He wanted more goals \u2013 as always \u2013 and a second dipping Haaland header in a crowded Sparta area went close. It was repelled and, after a fleeting bit of pinball around the six-yard box, City went close to being sucker-punched as, again, Birmancevic skated from his half toward goal. With Matheus Nunes and Rico Lewis puffing behind, he aimed across Ortega, from the right, but the keeper tipped away. The highlights of what was left of the first half were a Foden attempt Vindahl beat out, and a Savinho twist-and-unload. As the interval arrived, the Czech champions of the last two seasons had kept the deficit to one. As with Wolves on Sunday, Sparta were a low-block proposition. City had to find a way past again to make themselves comfortable. The order was to go more direct: Foden dropped a corner in from the right, Olatunji inadvertently flicked on, Haaland tipped the ball back from the far post and Nathan Ak\u00e9 converted. Except he was culpable of handball, so the finish was chalked off. It appeared harsh \u2013 his hand had nowhere to go \u2013 and Guardiola\u2019s chuntering in the ear of Andrea Colombo, the fourth official, underlined the point. Guardiola is quick to point out when sides defend in a bank and quick to follow up with a line about not judging them. A second Foden corner \u2013 from the same right quadrant \u2013 again caused disarray and, knowing how shrewd the 53-year-old is, it seemed a ploy to attack the flanks in the hope of breaching the opposition defence aerially. Savinho skipped along the right, scooped the ball high and Haaland jumped and saw Vindahl save again. Not so, the Norwegian phenom\u2019s next act. Once more Savinho jogged down his corridor, pivoted and floated the ball over. What followed was supreme: Haaland, back to goal, let go the flying backheel that went into the turf and bounced over and beyond Vindahl. Stones was the match winner at Wolves and he hopped to meet a clever dink from Nunes and head in City\u2019s third.

      "bodyText": "The rise of an almost untreatable superbug has been linked to a common antibiotic, an Australian-led study has found. The study \u2013 published in Nature \u2013 found that rifaximin, an antibiotic used to treat liver disease, causes resistance to another antibiotic, daptomycin. Daptomycin is one of the few drugs that is effective against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), a contagious bacterial infection that can cause serious reactions in hospitalised patients. Dr Adrianna Turner, the study\u2019s lead author, said the \u201creally surprising\u201d finding was the first recorded instance of an antibiotic causing resistance to one in a different class. It was previously thought that the risk of antibiotic resistance only applied to the one antibiotic. The findings also overturned the widely held idea that rifaximin was a low-risk antibiotic. Last month international leaders committed to decisive action on antimicrobial resistance \u2013 the development of bacteria to resist treatment. This included the aim of reducing the estimated global 4.95m deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance annually by 10 percentage points by 2030. Turner said when bacteria became resistant to an antibiotic, \u201cit\u2019s a bit like gaining a new ability in a video game\u201d. \u201cBut when exposed to rifaximin, the VRE bacteria don\u2019t just get one boost \u2013 they gain multiple abilities, like super-speed and super-strength, allowing them to easily defeat even the final boss, which in this case is the antibiotic daptomycin.\u201d Rifaximin use triggers changes in an enzyme within the bacteria, which then leads to changes in the VRE\u2019s cell membrane, causing cross-resistance, researchers from the Doherty Institute and Austin Health found. Turner did not rule out the possibility that other antibiotics could create resistance to antibiotics in different classes. Researchers are now investigating whether daptomycin-resistant strains of VRE may be transmitted to other patients within the hospital. The eight-year study involved genomic analyses of isolates from patients from Australia and Germany, and used animal models to support the hypotheses. Turner said the findings highlighted the need for surveillance and investigation into how bacteria become antibiotic-resistant, allowing researchers to create diagnostic tests and genomic surveillance to understand the prevalence of such bacteria. Prof Jason Kwong, from Austin Health, emphasised that rifaximin is still effective when used appropriately and those taking it to treat advanced liver disease should continue to do so. \u201cBut we need to understand the implications going forward both when treating individual patients and from a public health perspective,\u201d he said. He advised clinicians treating patients with VRE who have taken rifaximin to confirm that daptomycin is working via a lab test, as its efficacy may be affected. Kwong emphasised the importance of drug regulators considering whether the use of one drug makes another less effective when approving new drugs. Prof Martina Sanderson-Smith, a molecular bacteriologist at the University of Wollongong, said the finding that antibiotic resistance can affect different types of antibiotics was \u201creally concerning and interesting\u201d. She said the findings highlighted the difficulties in the responsible use and prescription of antibiotics, and the need to balance safety with clinical need. \u201cWe need to better understand the possible sort of consequences of prescribing all classes of antibiotics on this idea of shared resistance across antibiotic classes, so that clinicians can make more informed decisions,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Nearly a decade after filing a federal antitrust lawsuit against the Ultimate Fighting Championship, more than 1,000 former and current professional mixed martial artists should begin receiving payments from a pool of $260m starting next June.</p> <p>Federal judge Richard F Boulware granted preliminary approval of a negotiated settlement between the two parties on Tuesday. Once final, the $375m agreement would end the proceedings in Le, et al v Zuffa LLC, one of two classes Boulware certified last year that cover UFC fighters from the end of 2010 through the present day. The other, Johnson, et al v Zuffa LLC, represents the interests of fighters beginning in July 2017, and is ongoing.</p> <p>The fighters\u2019 co-lead class counsel, who are expected to receive close to a third of the Le settlement in fees and expenses pending Boulware\u2019s approval, will have a chance to collect more than a hefty sum in Johnson since hard questions about the UFC\u2019s contract and business model are on the table.</p> <h2><strong>What is the UFC?</strong></h2> <p>Founded in 1993, the Ultimate Fighting Championship is the world\u2019s foremost mixed martial arts promotion featuring more than 600 fighters from nearly 80 countries on its current roster. In January 2001, an ownership group led by brothers and Las Vegas casino magnates Frank and Lorenzo Feritta embarked on a journey that lifted the UFC and the sport of MMA from the shadows to the global mainstream.</p> <p>After purchasing the struggling company for $2m from its original owners, Semaphore Entertainment Group, the Fertitta-owned Zuffa LLC, spearheaded by president and CEO Dana White, began knocking down doors and building its business. Fifteen years later, the Fertittas sold the UFC to sports and entertainment giant Endeavor in a $4.2bn deal. Under the publicly traded TKO Group Holdings, the UFC lives alongside the WWE and is valued at more than $12bn.</p> <h2><strong>Why was the UFC sued in a class-action federal antitrust case?</strong></h2> <p>On the way to becoming a politically and culturally important business, the UFC proudly outlasted numerous would-be rivals, often absorbing their assets in the process, namely valuable fighter contracts. Many UFC stars from the past 20 years joined the company as a result of the misfortune of another promoter.</p> <p>This consolidation gave Zuffa tremendous leverage over the MMA labor market. For most people watching the sport, the one way a fighter could be perceived as a \u201cworld champion\u201d is to hold a UFC belt, meaning only fighters who signed a promotional contract with White\u2019s company were eligible.</p> <p>The original civil suit was filed in 2014, by former UFC fighters Cung Le, Nathan Quarry, Jon Fitch, Brandon Vera, Javier Vazquez, and Kyle Kingsbury. According to the plaintiffs, Zuffa schemed to lock fighters into restrictive long-term contracts while capping the revenue paid to the athletes, effectively suppressing wages.</p> <p>Fighters represented in the lawsuit \u2013 1,952, all told \u2013 allege that Zuffa pulled this off by eliminating options on the buyer side, absorbing and shuttering the competition, while paying no more than 20% of UFC revenue to the athletes \u2013 a significantly lower wage share than those found in major US-based professional sports (in the NFL, for example, <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/players-share-of-revenue-can-go-as-high-as-48-8-percent\">players receive around half of league revenue</a>).</p> <p>Combining restrictive contracts and business tactics that limited fighters\u2019 mobility in the marketplace (technically, they are independent contractors but are exclusively bound to the UFC), the labor side amounted to an industry dominated by a single buyer, making the UFC a \u201cmonopsony\u201d in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.</p> <h2><strong>Why did the UFC pay $375m to fighters?</strong></h2> <p>In his 80-page order granting the fighters\u2019 class status in 2023, Boulware wrote the plaintiffs had established that they \u201csuffered economic injury as a result of defendant\u2019s anti-competitive conduct.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the litigation process, during hearings, and in the language of the settlement document, lawyers for the UFC echoed White by disputing the notion that the company had done anything wrong. Nonetheless, Boulware denied a motion to dismiss the case and allowed it to survive summary judgment. Before the decade-long litigation battle was originally set for a jury trial in April 2024, a settlement agreement materialized through a mediator.</p> <p>Maintaining that they are not liable for the claims and that they would have a good defense in front of a jury, attorneys for the UFC said it had agreed to settle, in part, to \u201cavoid further expense, inconvenience, and the distraction of protracted litigation.\u201d</p> <p>The global settlement in July would have delivered $335m to fighters and resolved both the Le and Johnson lawsuits.</p> <p>For the UFC, the tax-deductible settlement payments carried significantly less risk than a jury trial, where a guilty verdict in Le had the potential of $811m to $1.6bn in damages, which could have also then been trebled by the court.</p> <p>But in mid-July, Judge Boulware balked and declined preliminary approval, saying he wanted to see \u201clife-changing money.\u201d He described the payout, split 90/10 between the two cases, as insufficient and declared that the interests between the two classes were actually in conflict.</p> <p>Where Le became solely about damages, Johnson has the potential for injunctive relief, namely concrete changes to contracts and the UFC business model.</p>    <h2><strong>What made fighters from 2010 to 2017 settle instead of present their case to a jury?</strong></h2> <p>Based on 158 declarations filed with the court as part of the revised settlement agreement, the disbursements can\u2019t come fast enough for many fighters who are among the more than 1,000 members of the Le class.</p> <p>Boulware said the sheer volume of declarations was unlike anything he had seen during hundreds of antitrust cases he previously presided over, calling the heart-wrenching statements a \u201cquite significant\u201d factor in his decision.</p> <p>Pushing forward to trial, which was set for February 2025, would have presented an all-or-nothing situation for the athletes. Even victory could have led to lengthy appeals by the UFC.</p> <p>Instead, Le class members will receive 25% more than under the prior agreement. The gross settlement amounts to roughly 70% of the total compensation the UFC paid to the entire roster of fighters during the class period ($375m out of $538m), and more than 40% of the estimated damages, which the plaintiffs attorneys noted \u201cis better than any other worker-side monopsonization case in the history of class action jurisprudence in this country.\u201d</p> <p>A formula that factors a fighter\u2019s competitive compensation plus $14,000 per bout determines the disbursement, which comes out to around 30% of what he or she made during the class period. Payments to fighters will vary. Thirty-five are in line to net over $1m. Five hundred will receive in excess of $100,000.

      "bodyText": "Nearly a decade after filing a federal antitrust lawsuit against the Ultimate Fighting Championship, more than 1,000 former and current professional mixed martial artists should begin receiving payments from a pool of $260m starting next June. Federal judge Richard F Boulware granted preliminary approval of a negotiated settlement between the two parties on Tuesday. Once final, the $375m agreement would end the proceedings in Le, et al v Zuffa LLC, one of two classes Boulware certified last year that cover UFC fighters from the end of 2010 through the present day. The other, Johnson, et al v Zuffa LLC, represents the interests of fighters beginning in July 2017, and is ongoing. The fighters\u2019 co-lead class counsel, who are expected to receive close to a third of the Le settlement in fees and expenses pending Boulware\u2019s approval, will have a chance to collect more than a hefty sum in Johnson since hard questions about the UFC\u2019s contract and business model are on the table. What is the UFC? Founded in 1993, the Ultimate Fighting Championship is the world\u2019s foremost mixed martial arts promotion featuring more than 600 fighters from nearly 80 countries on its current roster. In January 2001, an ownership group led by brothers and Las Vegas casino magnates Frank and Lorenzo Feritta embarked on a journey that lifted the UFC and the sport of MMA from the shadows to the global mainstream. After purchasing the struggling company for $2m from its original owners, Semaphore Entertainment Group, the Fertitta-owned Zuffa LLC, spearheaded by president and CEO Dana White, began knocking down doors and building its business. Fifteen years later, the Fertittas sold the UFC to sports and entertainment giant Endeavor in a $4.2bn deal. Under the publicly traded TKO Group Holdings, the UFC lives alongside the WWE and is valued at more than $12bn. Why was the UFC sued in a class-action federal antitrust case? On the way to becoming a politically and culturally important business, the UFC proudly outlasted numerous would-be rivals, often absorbing their assets in the process, namely valuable fighter contracts. Many UFC stars from the past 20 years joined the company as a result of the misfortune of another promoter. This consolidation gave Zuffa tremendous leverage over the MMA labor market. For most people watching the sport, the one way a fighter could be perceived as a \u201cworld champion\u201d is to hold a UFC belt, meaning only fighters who signed a promotional contract with White\u2019s company were eligible. The original civil suit was filed in 2014, by former UFC fighters Cung Le, Nathan Quarry, Jon Fitch, Brandon Vera, Javier Vazquez, and Kyle Kingsbury. According to the plaintiffs, Zuffa schemed to lock fighters into restrictive long-term contracts while capping the revenue paid to the athletes, effectively suppressing wages. Fighters represented in the lawsuit \u2013 1,952, all told \u2013 allege that Zuffa pulled this off by eliminating options on the buyer side, absorbing and shuttering the competition, while paying no more than 20% of UFC revenue to the athletes \u2013 a significantly lower wage share than those found in major US-based professional sports (in the NFL, for example, players receive around half of league revenue). Combining restrictive contracts and business tactics that limited fighters\u2019 mobility in the marketplace (technically, they are independent contractors but are exclusively bound to the UFC), the labor side amounted to an industry dominated by a single buyer, making the UFC a \u201cmonopsony\u201d in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Why did the UFC pay $375m to fighters? In his 80-page order granting the fighters\u2019 class status in 2023, Boulware wrote the plaintiffs had established that they \u201csuffered economic injury as a result of defendant\u2019s anti-competitive conduct.\u201d Throughout the litigation process, during hearings, and in the language of the settlement document, lawyers for the UFC echoed White by disputing the notion that the company had done anything wrong. Nonetheless, Boulware denied a motion to dismiss the case and allowed it to survive summary judgment. Before the decade-long litigation battle was originally set for a jury trial in April 2024, a settlement agreement materialized through a mediator. Maintaining that they are not liable for the claims and that they would have a good defense in front of a jury, attorneys for the UFC said it had agreed to settle, in part, to \u201cavoid further expense, inconvenience, and the distraction of protracted litigation.\u201d The global settlement in July would have delivered $335m to fighters and resolved both the Le and Johnson lawsuits. For the UFC, the tax-deductible settlement payments carried significantly less risk than a jury trial, where a guilty verdict in Le had the potential of $811m to $1.6bn in damages, which could have also then been trebled by the court. But in mid-July, Judge Boulware balked and declined preliminary approval, saying he wanted to see \u201clife-changing money.\u201d He described the payout, split 90/10 between the two cases, as insufficient and declared that the interests between the two classes were actually in conflict. Where Le became solely about damages, Johnson has the potential for injunctive relief, namely concrete changes to contracts and the UFC business model. What made fighters from 2010 to 2017 settle instead of present their case to a jury? Based on 158 declarations filed with the court as part of the revised settlement agreement, the disbursements can\u2019t come fast enough for many fighters who are among the more than 1,000 members of the Le class. Boulware said the sheer volume of declarations was unlike anything he had seen during hundreds of antitrust cases he previously presided over, calling the heart-wrenching statements a \u201cquite significant\u201d factor in his decision. Pushing forward to trial, which was set for February 2025, would have presented an all-or-nothing situation for the athletes. Even victory could have led to lengthy appeals by the UFC. Instead, Le class members will receive 25% more than under the prior agreement. The gross settlement amounts to roughly 70% of the total compensation the UFC paid to the entire roster of fighters during the class period ($375m out of $538m), and more than 40% of the estimated damages, which the plaintiffs attorneys noted \u201cis better than any other worker-side monopsonization case in the history of class action jurisprudence in this country.\u201d A formula that factors a fighter\u2019s competitive compensation plus $14,000 per bout determines the disbursement, which comes out to around 30% of what he or she made during the class period. Payments to fighters will vary. Thirty-five are in line to net over $1m. Five hundred will receive in excess of $100,000. Nearly 800 can expect more than $50,000. Meanwhile, members of the Johnson class, including hundreds of fighters covered in the Le settlement, can still pursue additional damages and, crucially, injunctive relief as that case moves forward. Why did it take nearly a decade to set a trial date? Pursuing an antitrust class action lawsuit was always going to take time. Fighters were told five to six years as a estimate when they were pitched by attorneys in 2013. No one could have foreseen the pandemic. Nor could they have known that before Bouleware could issue a key ruling in Le v Zuffa LLC, the Barack Obama appointee would have to wait while another case involving the price-fixing of tuna worked its way through an appeals court. Does the settlement impact UFC\u2019s business practices? No. Anyone hoping for hard and fast changes to the UFC\u2019s contract and single-entity business model will need to wait for an outcome in the Johnson case, which is early in the discovery phase and remains years away from resolution. Injunctive relief \u2013 the discretionary power of the court to restrain or require certain remedies to prohibit the kind of restrictive conduct that the fighters alleged UFC was guilty of \u2013 went out the window in Le as a consequence of delays and the addition of the Johnson case. When Boulware denied the previous settlement, he made it a point to say that the two classes had different stakes and had to be untangled from one another. A new class counsel has been added to the case to help address the judge\u2019s concerns. Is any of this legally significant? The initial settlement included minor changes to contracts, but that \u201cprospective relief\u201d left a lot to be desired. Those issues are on the table in Johnson, though many fighters in that class became party to class-action waivers when they signed contracts with the UFC. After a US supreme court ruling in 2018 that deemed such waivers constitutional, more than half of the fighters in that class have those clauses in their contracts. Boulware sounded keen on seeing these clauses challenged by the plaintiffs, and the Johnson action could put the issue in front of an appeals court. Writing in support of the fighters, professor Eric Posner of the University of Chicago Law School noted that Le \u201cis the first [labor-side claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act] ever to survive summary judgment, reach class certification, or even survive a motion to dismiss,\u201d therefore the \u201cplaintiffs secured important judicial opinions that will help litigants and future courts adjudicate Section 2 [Sherman Act] labor antitrust cases.\u201d Counsel for the fighters declared that the case and settlement are \u201cremarkable, groundbreaking achievements\u201d compared to other cases. While the monetary awards in the Le settlement should prove meaningful, the chance for structural changes to the UFC business as a result of the Johnson action could go a long way in determining whether or not that\u2019s true.",

It is an extension of communications safety measures that have been turned on by default since iOS 17 for Apple users under 13 but are available to all users. Under the existing safety features, an iPhone automatically detects images and videos that contain nudity children might receive or attempt to send in iMessage, AirDrop, FaceTime and Photos. The detection happens on devices to protect privacy.</p> <p>If a sensitive image is detected, the young user is shown two intervention screens before they can proceed, and given the offer of resources or a way to contact a parent or guardian.</p>    <p>With the new feature, when the warning comes up, users will also have the option to report the images and videos to Apple.</p> <p>The device will prepare a report containing the images or videos, as well as messages sent immediately before and after the image or video. It will include the contact information from both accounts, and users can fill out a form describing what happened.</p> <p>The report will be reviewed by Apple, which can take action on an account \u2013 such as disabling that user\u2019s ability to send messages over iMessage \u2013 and also report the issue to law enforcement.</p> <p>Apple said the plan would be initially to roll out the feature in Australia in the latest beta update, but that it would be released globally in the future.</p> <p>The timing of the announcement as well as picking Australia as the first region to get the new feature coincides with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/22/apple-security-child-sexual-images-accusation\">new codes coming into force</a>.

      "bodyText": "Apple is introducing a new feature to iMessage in Australia that will allow children to report nude images and video being sent to them directly to the company, which could then report the messages to police. The change comes as part of Thursday\u2019s beta releases of the new versions of Apple\u2019s operating systems for Australian users. It is an extension of communications safety measures that have been turned on by default since iOS 17 for Apple users under 13 but are available to all users. Under the existing safety features, an iPhone automatically detects images and videos that contain nudity children might receive or attempt to send in iMessage, AirDrop, FaceTime and Photos. The detection happens on devices to protect privacy. If a sensitive image is detected, the young user is shown two intervention screens before they can proceed, and given the offer of resources or a way to contact a parent or guardian. With the new feature, when the warning comes up, users will also have the option to report the images and videos to Apple. The device will prepare a report containing the images or videos, as well as messages sent immediately before and after the image or video. It will include the contact information from both accounts, and users can fill out a form describing what happened. The report will be reviewed by Apple, which can take action on an account \u2013 such as disabling that user\u2019s ability to send messages over iMessage \u2013 and also report the issue to law enforcement. Apple said the plan would be initially to roll out the feature in Australia in the latest beta update, but that it would be released globally in the future. The timing of the announcement as well as picking Australia as the first region to get the new feature coincides with new codes coming into force. By the end of 2024, tech companies will be required to police child abuse and terror content on cloud and messaging services that operate in Australia. Apple had warned that the draft of the code would not protect end-to-end encryption and would leave the communications of everyone who uses the services vulnerable to mass surveillance. The Australian eSafety commissioner ultimately watered down the law, allowing companies that believe it would break end-to-end encryption to demonstrate alternative actions to tackle child abuse and terror content they would take instead. Apple has faced strong criticism from regulators and law enforcement across the globe over its reluctance to compromise end-to-end encryption in iMessage for law enforcement purposes. Apple abandoned plans to scan photos and videos stored in its iCloud product for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in late 2022, eliciting further rebuke. Apple, WhatsApp and other advocates for encryption say that any backdoors to encryption endanger users\u2019 privacy globally. The UK\u2019s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) had accused Apple of vastly undercounting how often CSAM appears in its products, the Guardian revealed in July. In 2023, Apple made just 267 reports of suspected CSAM on its platforms worldwide to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), which is vastly lower compared to other tech giants in the industry, with Google reporting more than 1.47m and Meta reporting more than 30.6m, the NCMEC\u2019s annual report states. \u2022 In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help. For adult survivors of child abuse, help is available at ascasupport.org. In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331. In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380. Other sources of help can be found at Child Helplines International",

UAW members in Michigan \u2013 the center of the US auto industry \u2013 support Harris over Trump by 20 percentage points, with 54% supporting Harris over 34% supporting Trump, the poll found. The union claimed in 2020 that UAW members accounted for 84% of Joe Biden\u2019s margin of victory in Michigan. The poll also found that support among non-college-educated men \u2013 a key demographic where Harris has been lagging \u2013 gave Harris a 14-point margin over Trump. Both Trump and Harris have courted the UAW\u2019s members. The UAW president, Shawn Fain, has backed Harris and become a target of Trump\u2019s ire. Biden supported the UAW in its strike against the US\u2019s big three auto companies last year, becoming the first president to walk a picket line. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage.

The Venom franchise, which launched in 2018 to surprise success, had already felt like a throwback to an earlier time \u2013 a glossy and light-hearted burst of mid-00s nostalgia \u2013 but now, with its third and final chapter releasing at such a fraught time, it also feels like a reminder of a more recent time when these films used to mean more to audiences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/10/conclave-movie-review-ralph-fiennes\">Conclave review \u2013 Ralph Fiennes takes charge of tense papal election thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether or not something like Venom: The Last Dance will jolt enough of a response remains to be seen (the second film saw a $350m drop at the global box office and the third is tracking for a franchise-low opening) but it\u2019s at least a smartly planned conclusion to an inoffensively silly and low-stakes series, Tom Hardy and his quippy alien symbiote leaping off a sinking ship with a spring in their step. It\u2019s not as catastrophic as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/13/madame-web-marvel-movie-review\">Madame Web</a> or as redundant as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/08/the-marvels-review-captain-marvel-brie-larson\">The Marvels</a> or as annoying as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jul/23/deadpool-wolverine-review-ryan-reynolds-and-hugh-jackman-mcu\">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</a>, it\u2019s <em>just</em> about passable in a throwaway kinda way, blessed by a surprisingly brief runtime that doesn\u2019t allow it to grate or exhaust. If only it amused and excited us a little bit more.</p> <p>The novelty of Hardy sparring with a dance-loving, head-eating, chocolate-guzzling alien that lives within him wore off in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/30/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review\">the middling second outing</a>, where the first film\u2019s co-writer Kelly Marcel took sole credit. She returns here, also debuting as director, and brings the same struggles with her, failing to find the funny in the absurdist conceit, her dialogue quite staggeringly refusing to make us laugh even once. The franchise\u2019s lack of portentousness has always been one of its major selling points yet it\u2019s not translated into enough genuine humour, something that becomes far more glaring this time around. Hardy intensely commits, as ever, returning as the journalist Eddie Brock who we left last time as he was zapped into the multiverse, one where Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-Man had just been outed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyIyd9joTTc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HyIyd9joTTc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>But his time there is short, returning to his world after just one scene and a jab at how tiresome the multiverse is (it\u2019s hard to tell if this was always the intention or a rethought result of a shrinking genre). A clunky and convoluted cold open tees us into the threat of an impending war as Eddie and Venom are on the run not just from the authorities but also another alien, tracking them to obtain a magic cortex that would help free a new Big Bad.

      "bodyText": "The recent, long-awaited, cratering of the superhero movie (with a notable Deadpool-sized exception) has led to a mad scramble \u2013 release dates pushed, marketing strategies tweaked, Robert Downey Jr bribed \u2013 and a concerned question mark over what the future might hold for Hollywood\u2019s most commercially lucrative contemporary genre. The Venom franchise, which launched in 2018 to surprise success, had already felt like a throwback to an earlier time \u2013 a glossy and light-hearted burst of mid-00s nostalgia \u2013 but now, with its third and final chapter releasing at such a fraught time, it also feels like a reminder of a more recent time when these films used to mean more to audiences. Whether or not something like Venom: The Last Dance will jolt enough of a response remains to be seen (the second film saw a $350m drop at the global box office and the third is tracking for a franchise-low opening) but it\u2019s at least a smartly planned conclusion to an inoffensively silly and low-stakes series, Tom Hardy and his quippy alien symbiote leaping off a sinking ship with a spring in their step. It\u2019s not as catastrophic as Madame Web or as redundant as The Marvels or as annoying as Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, it\u2019s just about passable in a throwaway kinda way, blessed by a surprisingly brief runtime that doesn\u2019t allow it to grate or exhaust. If only it amused and excited us a little bit more. The novelty of Hardy sparring with a dance-loving, head-eating, chocolate-guzzling alien that lives within him wore off in the middling second outing, where the first film\u2019s co-writer Kelly Marcel took sole credit. She returns here, also debuting as director, and brings the same struggles with her, failing to find the funny in the absurdist conceit, her dialogue quite staggeringly refusing to make us laugh even once. The franchise\u2019s lack of portentousness has always been one of its major selling points yet it\u2019s not translated into enough genuine humour, something that becomes far more glaring this time around. Hardy intensely commits, as ever, returning as the journalist Eddie Brock who we left last time as he was zapped into the multiverse, one where Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-Man had just been outed. But his time there is short, returning to his world after just one scene and a jab at how tiresome the multiverse is (it\u2019s hard to tell if this was always the intention or a rethought result of a shrinking genre). A clunky and convoluted cold open tees us into the threat of an impending war as Eddie and Venom are on the run not just from the authorities but also another alien, tracking them to obtain a magic cortex that would help free a new Big Bad. Their journey intersects with an alien-seeking family (led by Rhys Ifans), the military (led by Chiwetel Ejiofor) and some scientists (led by Juno Temple) as well as a figure from his past (Stephen Graham). Arguably the strangest film about a film so thirsty to be defined as strange is the amount of British actors playing American \u2026 It\u2019s quick and brash and seemingly aware of how goofy so much of it is but it\u2019s also awkwardly overstuffed. There are jokes without punchlines (a tertiary character\u2019s obsession with Christmas goes nowhere), unnecessary backstories (Temple\u2019s scientist gets a dead brother we never needed to know about) and a villain we never really get to see in full (he will allegedly be part of Sony\u2019s upcoming, much-delayed Kraven the Hunter). While it\u2019s a mercy to watch a superhero film of such brevity at a time when even evil clown horrors are running over two hours, it also has the stop-and-start choppiness of something that has caused endless headaches in the cutting room. Marcel is a director of ho-hum competence, and like many within this world, gets lost in a frantic, hard-to-follow finale of gloop and guns. An abrupt, Maroon 5-soundtracked joke of an ending shows it all to be one big lark, a relief in a way that even the alleged conclusion of the series wouldn\u2019t aim for out-of-reach emotion but also a reminder of its utter disposability. You might remember where this franchise started but you\u2019ll be hard pressed to remember how it ends. Venom: The Last Dance is out in Australia now and in US and UK cinemas on 25 October",

It was only to intensify.</p> <p>Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s next move raised eyebrows. Retegui, the top scorer in Italy\u2019s top flight, was withdrawn shortly before the hour. Lookman soon exited, too, having failed to properly influence proceedings against a team who tried to sign him in his youth. Rodgers responded by replacing Adam Idah with Kyogo Furuhashi. The Irishman had been a surprise choice to lead the Celtic attack from the outset. Idah spent 68 minutes on the periphery of the game, which he could reasonably argue was hardly his fault. Furuhashi\u2019s movement did visibly concern Atalanta.</p> <p>Gasperini was increasingly agitated. Davide Zappacosta found Schmeichel\u2019s side net with teammates screaming for a pass. Celtic\u2019s test with 20 minutes to play was one of mental fortitude and physical strength. Valle found Furuhashi with a glorious ball from deep, with the Japanese miscuing his attempted lob of Atalanta\u2019s custodian. Celtic had no further chances, which barely concerned them.</p> <p>Hien headed over Schmeichel\u2019s bar in stoppage time. Celtic knew they had secured a point. Jubilation despite exhaustion from those in green and white suggested what transpired here meant a great deal more than that. \u201cWe took a practical approach,\u201d Schmeichel said.</p> <p>Whatever the label, it was also a highly effective one. Celtic can shoot for the Champions League stars once again. Maybe Rodgers will enjoy the last laugh by ensuring Dortmund is the outlier of this campaign.</p>",

Celtic had been semi-threatening on the counter against a team who are known to give up opportunity. Alex Valle almost snatched an unlikely opener for Celtic within five minutes of the restart. Instead, the full-back\u2019s deflected shot flew narrowly over with Marco Carnesecchi scrambling. Isak Hien headed wide and Marten de Roon forced Schmeichel into action from long range as Atalanta looked to douse frustration in the stands. It was only to intensify. Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s next move raised eyebrows. Retegui, the top scorer in Italy\u2019s top flight, was withdrawn shortly before the hour. Lookman soon exited, too, having failed to properly influence proceedings against a team who tried to sign him in his youth. Rodgers responded by replacing Adam Idah with Kyogo Furuhashi. The Irishman had been a surprise choice to lead the Celtic attack from the outset. Idah spent 68 minutes on the periphery of the game, which he could reasonably argue was hardly his fault. Furuhashi\u2019s movement did visibly concern Atalanta. Gasperini was increasingly agitated. Davide Zappacosta found Schmeichel\u2019s side net with teammates screaming for a pass. Celtic\u2019s test with 20 minutes to play was one of mental fortitude and physical strength. Valle found Furuhashi with a glorious ball from deep, with the Japanese miscuing his attempted lob of Atalanta\u2019s custodian. Celtic had no further chances, which barely concerned them. Hien headed over Schmeichel\u2019s bar in stoppage time. Celtic knew they had secured a point. Jubilation despite exhaustion from those in green and white suggested what transpired here meant a great deal more than that. \u201cWe took a practical approach,\u201d Schmeichel said. Whatever the label, it was also a highly effective one. Celtic can shoot for the Champions League stars once again. Maybe Rodgers will enjoy the last laugh by ensuring Dortmund is the outlier of this campaign.",

      "bodyText": "A pay-per-mile road pricing system must be brought in now, according to Tony Blair\u2019s thinktank, which is urging the chancellor to overhaul motoring taxes. Rachel Reeves is widely expected to confirm the end of a temporary 5p cut in fuel duty, and possibly announce an inflationary rise in the tax paid on petrol and diesel at the pumps, in her budget next Wednesday. However, the Tony Blair Institute has suggested that instead of restoring fuel duty rates as planned, Reeves should introduce a simple road pricing system of 1p a mile for cars and vans, and 2.5p to 4p for lorries and heavy goods vehicles. A new report from the institute argues that the change would generate the same revenue from motorists as the Treasury expects to raise from an end to the 2022 temporary cut in fuel duty \u2013 and thus acting now could be less politically toxic than later. Attempts by the Blair government in 2007 to introduce widespread road tolling were met with an enormous public backlash and a record number of people signed a parliamentary petition objecting. However, the expected switch to electric cars and the subsequent decline in fuel duty, which brings in about \u00a325bn a year to the exchequer, has reinvigorated calls for reform. The institute said bringing in a low-level road pricing scheme would be \u201ca crucial step in reforming the UK\u2019s system of motoring taxation for the electric-vehicle era [and] help prevent a growth-stifling rise in road congestion\u201d. It envisages the early level of charging to cost the average motorist about \u00a370 a year, which would be payable based on mileage readings taken from cars\u2019 odometers at their annual MOT check. Fuel duty would not be abolished but frozen and eventually become redundant as vehicles become zero-emission, with the price per mile rising to about 10-12p a mile by 2050, the report suggests. There have been weeks of speculation about reforms, intensified after the head of the National Infrastructure Commission, Sir John Armitt, said road pricing was \u201cinevitable\u201d. Groups including the Campaign for Better Transport have also urged reform to bring in pay-per-mile charges for electric vehicles. Reeves has warned that the country faces a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in its finances. The Tony Blair Institute also urged her to change fiscal rules to allow for investment, and to overhaul stamp duty while raising council tax on more expensive houses.

Both defendants pled guilty to these charges.\u201d In cases like Erickson\u2019s, the circumstances need to be taken into account, said Berry of the Brennan Center. \u201cThese are honest mistakes. That\u2019s not fraud,\u201d he said. Until then, people like Laurie Erickson are living with the consequences. Speaking about her experience, Erickson is forlorn, but she is also angry. She says she\u2019ll never vote again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the system,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf they can wait two years and come after me, they can wait two years to come after me again. And I\u2019m not giving them no reason.\u201d",

Brianna, aged 16, was stabbed to death in a \u201csadistic\u201d and \u201cexceptionally brutal\u201d murder in a Warrington park on 11 February 2023 by Ratcliffe and Scarlett Jenkinson, who were both 15 at the time.

      "body": "<p>Those we didn\u2019t know we would miss. Those we didn\u2019t know we had loved, even.</p> \n<p>Westminster can be a brutal place. Somewhere ambition collides with reality. Where egos come to die. But just occasionally there is a crack in its tough facade. A crack that lets the light in. To a world where politicians show their softer side. Respect may be pushing it a bit far. So let\u2019s call it a common humanity. A recognition that they are all in it together.</p> \n<p>With Keir Starmer en route to Samoa for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, prime minister\u2019s questions were handed over to the two deputies. Angela Rayner and Oliver Dowden. An occasion for everyone to be demob happy. When no one need try too hard. Where nothing really matters too much. Where power goes hand in hand with irresponsibility. A time for everyone to let their hair down.</p> \n<p>Rayner is a known quantity at deputy PMQs. A force of nature. She can dish it out with the best of them, while retaining a smile on her face. Somehow she pulls off the impossible, by appearing not to take herself too seriously while actually taking herself very seriously indeed. No one gets away with taking any liberties with her. Cut away the laughter and you quickly get to steel. The Tory benches are littered with the bodies of MPs who have underestimated her. Make that the Labour benches as well.</p> \n<p>It was Dowden who was the revelation at this PMQs. Three months in opposition has done Olive, as almost everyone calls him, nothing but good. In government he had to try just that bit too hard merely to stand still. Imagine being that guy on such a ship of fools. The one who couldn\u2019t even keep up with Liz Truss or James Cleverly. Let alone Honest Bob Jenrick. The shame.</p> \n<p>So Olive always used to struggle in the chamber. Terrified of being found out, his face used to look permanently pinched. It was uncomfortable watching him trying to live up to the person he clearly was never going to be. Every outing was just another dance with failure.</p> \n<p>But now he is a liberated soul. There is no longer any artifice involved. Instead, he has embraced his own failure. Has owned the essential futility of his existence. The Dialectics of Being Oliver Dowden.

      "bodyText": "Those we didn\u2019t know we would miss. Those we didn\u2019t know we had loved, even. Westminster can be a brutal place. Somewhere ambition collides with reality. Where egos come to die. But just occasionally there is a crack in its tough facade. A crack that lets the light in. To a world where politicians show their softer side. Respect may be pushing it a bit far. So let\u2019s call it a common humanity. A recognition that they are all in it together. With Keir Starmer en route to Samoa for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, prime minister\u2019s questions were handed over to the two deputies. Angela Rayner and Oliver Dowden. An occasion for everyone to be demob happy. When no one need try too hard. Where nothing really matters too much. Where power goes hand in hand with irresponsibility. A time for everyone to let their hair down. Rayner is a known quantity at deputy PMQs. A force of nature. She can dish it out with the best of them, while retaining a smile on her face. Somehow she pulls off the impossible, by appearing not to take herself too seriously while actually taking herself very seriously indeed. No one gets away with taking any liberties with her. Cut away the laughter and you quickly get to steel. The Tory benches are littered with the bodies of MPs who have underestimated her. Make that the Labour benches as well. It was Dowden who was the revelation at this PMQs. Three months in opposition has done Olive, as almost everyone calls him, nothing but good. In government he had to try just that bit too hard merely to stand still. Imagine being that guy on such a ship of fools. The one who couldn\u2019t even keep up with Liz Truss or James Cleverly. Let alone Honest Bob Jenrick. The shame. So Olive always used to struggle in the chamber. Terrified of being found out, his face used to look permanently pinched. It was uncomfortable watching him trying to live up to the person he clearly was never going to be. Every outing was just another dance with failure. But now he is a liberated soul. There is no longer any artifice involved. Instead, he has embraced his own failure. Has owned the essential futility of his existence. The Dialectics of Being Oliver Dowden. By hurtling towards the very worst of himself \u2013 the bits from which he used to run \u2013 he somehow now manages to present the best of himself. This is Olive Unplugged. A man at one with his limitations. Who no longer cares if he\u2019s a fraud. Deep down he knows he should never have been a politician. He should have been a maitre D at a Pizza Express. Not many politicians have that level of self-acceptance. Dowden began by acknowledging this was the last time he would be speaking from the opposition frontbench.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons because he is under 18, appeared before magistrates in Bristol on Tuesday. Ch Insp Vicks Hayward-Melen said: \u201cOur thoughts are foremost with Luka\u2019s family at this hugely difficult time. We are providing them with support through a specialist family liaison officer and they have been updated with the charging decision, which marks significant progress in this murder investigation. \u201cThe family have understandably asked for privacy as they attempt to come to terms with what has happened over the past 48 hours and we\u2019d ask people to please respect their wishes.\u201d She added: \u201cWe know tragic incidents like this one can cause significant concerns within any community, and therefore we encourage anyone who is worried to please make themselves known to officers in the area who are carrying out additional patrols. They will be able to provide assistance and reassurance to anyone who has concerns.\u201d",

A rapist can also be in the family, among our friends.\u201d</p> \n<p>After hearing wives or girlfriends or friends in court saying the accused did not seem capable of rape, she said: \u201cWe have to progress on rape culture in society \u2026 People should learn the definition of rape.\u201d</p> \n<p>Addressing her ex-husband but saying she refused to turn her head to look at him in the dock, she said: \u201cHow can the perfect man have got to this?

She said she had not noticed falling under sedation and must have passed out very quickly.</p> \n<p>She told the court: \u201cHe made a lot of meals. I saw that as him being attentive. I know that one night he came to collect me at Avignon station after 10 days with my grandchildren. He had already prepared the meal \u2013 mashed potato. Two plates were already in the oven. I put olive oil on my potatoes and he put butter, so it was easy to see which plate was his.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cWe would have a glass of white wine together. I never found anything strange about my potatoes. We finished eating. Often when it\u2019s a football match on TV, I\u2019d let him watch it alone. He brought my ice-cream to my bed, where I was, my favourite flavour, raspberry. And I thought, how lucky I am, he\u2019s a love.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI never felt my heart flutter, I didn\u2019t feel anything, I must have gone under very quickly. I would wake up with my pyjamas on. The mornings, I must have been more tired than usual, but I walk a lot and thought it was that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pelicot said she had noticed problems with her health. She feared she was having neurological problems or could have Alzheimer\u2019s, and she had really appreciated her husband apparently standing by her through that.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe took me to a neurologist, to scanners when I was worried. He also went with me to the gynaecologist. For me, he was someone I trusted entirely.\u201d She said to Dominique Pelicot in court: \u201cSo many times, I said to myself how lucky am I to have you at my side.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/a-soldier-a-nurse-a-lorry-driver-and-dozens-more-who-are-the-men-accused-over-and-assault-of-gisele-pelicot\">A soldier, a nurse, a lorry driver and dozens more: who are the men accused over rape and assault of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>She said she had also noticed gynaecological problems, which he had also supported her through. \u201cI consulted three gynaecologists.

I say it\u2019s not bravery, it\u2019s will and determination to change society.\u201d She said she wanted to lift the shame felt by rape victims. \u201cI wanted all woman victims of rape \u2013 not just when they have been drugged, rape exists at all levels \u2013 I want those women to say: Mrs Pelicot did it, we can do it too. When you\u2019re raped there is shame, and it\u2019s not for us to have shame, it\u2019s for them.\u201d She said: \u201cThe profile of a rapist is not someone met in a car park late at night. A rapist can also be in the family, among our friends.\u201d After hearing wives or girlfriends or friends in court saying the accused did not seem capable of rape, she said: \u201cWe have to progress on rape culture in society \u2026 People should learn the definition of rape.\u201d Addressing her ex-husband but saying she refused to turn her head to look at him in the dock, she said: \u201cHow can the perfect man have got to this? How could you have betrayed me to this point? How could you have brought these strangers into my bedroom?\u201d She said: \u201cI always tried to lift you higher, you who plumbed the depths of the human soul, but you made your own choices.\u201d Dominique Pelicot has admitted the charges against him and said that for almost a decade he was in contact with men on an online chatroom titled \u201cwithout her knowledge\u201d where he would organise for strangers to come to the couple\u2019s home in Mazan to rape his wife while she was in a comatose state in her bed. He has said he administered drugs to her at mealtimes or in bowls of ice-cream he brought to her as she watched TV after dinner. \u201cI am a rapist, like the others in this room,\u201d Pelicot has told the court, saying the other men on trial were aware they were being invited to rape his wife. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was asked in court if she had noticed moments when he might have drugged her food or drinks. She said she had not noticed falling under sedation and must have passed out very quickly. She told the court: \u201cHe made a lot of meals. I saw that as him being attentive. I know that one night he came to collect me at Avignon station after 10 days with my grandchildren. He had already prepared the meal \u2013 mashed potato. Two plates were already in the oven. I put olive oil on my potatoes and he put butter, so it was easy to see which plate was his.\u201d She said: \u201cWe would have a glass of white wine together. I never found anything strange about my potatoes. We finished eating. Often when it\u2019s a football match on TV, I\u2019d let him watch it alone. He brought my ice-cream to my bed, where I was, my favourite flavour, raspberry. And I thought, how lucky I am, he\u2019s a love.\u201d \u201cI never felt my heart flutter, I didn\u2019t feel anything, I must have gone under very quickly. I would wake up with my pyjamas on. The mornings, I must have been more tired than usual, but I walk a lot and thought it was that.\u201d Pelicot said she had noticed problems with her health. She feared she was having neurological problems or could have Alzheimer\u2019s, and she had really appreciated her husband apparently standing by her through that. \u201cHe took me to a neurologist, to scanners when I was worried. He also went with me to the gynaecologist. For me, he was someone I trusted entirely.\u201d She said to Dominique Pelicot in court: \u201cSo many times, I said to myself how lucky am I to have you at my side.\u201d She said she had also noticed gynaecological problems, which he had also supported her through. \u201cI consulted three gynaecologists. Several times I had woken up and felt like I had lost my waters \u2013 as happens when you give birth.\u201d She said of the druggings: \u201cIn the morning I take my breakfast in the kitchen, it\u2019s basic, orange juice, toast, jam, honey. He could have put it in my orange juice or my coffee. But I didn\u2019t feel that moment where I went under [as sedated].\u201d She said she once went for a morning hairdressing appointment and her husband insisted on driving her. She had what seemed like a blackout, she said, and did not remember the haircut or styling. In almost two months of testimony, the court has heard from dozens of accused men. The majority have denied rape. Some said they thought that she was pretending to be asleep or was playing a game, or felt the fact her husband had consented was sufficient. A total of 50 men were identified by police from films meticulously labelled and stored by Dominique Pelicot. The men on trial alongside him could face sentences of up to 20 years in prison if convicted. In total, 49 men are accused of rape, one of attempted rape and one of sexual assault. Five others are also accused of possessing child abuse imagery. Aged between 26 and 74, the accused include a nurse, a journalist, a prison officer, a local councillor, a soldier, lorry drivers and farm workers. The trial is expected to run until 20 December.",

Here is an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Keir Starmer is wholly correct when he says it is normal for Labour party staffers and former Labour party staffers to volunteer their own time in US presidential campaigns.</p> <p>But the big and important difference now is that Donald Trump is a very different kind of politician. In the unlikely event that Poilievre loses the next Canadian general election, Justin Trudeau, leader of the Liberals, would not freeze out a Jenrick-led British government. Clinton and John Major worked well on a range of issues, as did Tony Blair and George W Bush. Trump is mercurial, unpredictable and chaotic. </p> <p>If Trump does return to the White House in November, that will, I think, be the defining moment in the life of the Labour government. Any hope of a return to \u201cnormal\u201d politics will die alongside Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential ambitions. Starmer\u2019s government will have to find a new way of approaching the US-UK relationship: and what has, until now, been a \u201cnormal\u201d exchange of volunteers between the two countries\u2019 major centre-left parties may soon become a major diplomatic liability.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6718b6548f087dde7205ea57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-23T08:50:46.770Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Steve Reed</strong>, the environment secretary, has said that when he accepted free football tickets from a company last year, he did not know it was <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/25/environment-secretary-accepted-donation-company-linked-water-pollution-21674180/\">owned by a firm that owns most of Northumbria Water.</a></p> <p>Reed accepted the tickets, donated by a phone company, last year, when he was shadow environment secretary.</p> <p>In an interview with Sky News this morning, asked if he knew that CK Hutchison Holdings, who donated the tickets, owned 75% of CK Infrastructure Holdings, the owner of Northumbrian Water, Reed replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was nobody from a water company that was involved in offering those tickets.

Details were briefed out last night, here is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/governments-launch-largest-review-of-sector-since-privatisation\">the news release</a>, and here is <strong>Helena Horton</strong>\u2019s story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/22/new-commission-may-ban-england-water-companies-from-making-a-profit\">New commission may ban English water companies from making a profit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But instead Reed has spent the morning fending off a rather bizarre story about the Trump campaign filing a complaint with election regulators in the US alleging that the Labour party is interfering in the US presidential election. <strong>Eleni Courea</strong> has the details here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/23/keir-starmer-donald-trump-labour-election-interference-claim\">Starmer insists he can have a \u2018good relationship\u2019 with Trump despite election \u2018interference\u2019 claim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview with the Today programme, <strong>Reed</strong> said that it was \u201cperfectly normal\u201d for political activists to volunteer in election campaigns in other countries. In an interview with the Today programme, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s up to private individuals what they do with their free time, and it\u2019s actually perfectly normal for people who are interested in politics to go from one country to campaign for a sister party in another country.

This is just individuals using their own time and their own money.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about <a href=\"https://x.com/PolitlcsUK/status/1846859483428856266\">a post on LinkedIn</a> from Sofia Patel, head of operations at the Labour party, inviting more people to volunteer and saying their housing would be sorted out, Reed said Today programme would have to be speak to her, but \u201cthe Labour party has nothing to do with organising this\u201d.</p> <p>When it was put to him that the fact that the post has been taken down was an admission that it was badly worded, Reed just said he had not seen it.</p> <p>Reed is right, of course. Volunteering like this is routine (Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, helped out with the Bill Clinton campaign at one stage in 1992), and the Trump campaign don\u2019t seem too bothered about British inteference when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/17/farage-given-free-team-of-us-pr-advisers-by-former-bannon-aides-firm\">the person doing the interfering</a> is Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader. In one respect, the most interesting feature of the story is the fact that Donald Trump and his campaign team appear to be the only people on the planet who<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/57c91c25-bbf4-4c3d-b094-ff18557dd12f\"> think that Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party is \u201cfar left\u201d.</a></p> <p>But Trump may well win the US presidential election in two weeks\u2019 time and, although Starmer has been scrupulous about being respectful towards him as PM, and describes their relationship as \u201cgood\u201d, Trump is unpredictable and vindictive, and so this could be a story with repercussions.</p> <p>Starmer is spending all day travelling to the Commonwealth summit in Samoa, so we are not going to hear much more from him on this. But we\u2019ve got PMQs, and so the topic may come up there.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> John Healey, the defence secretary, holds a press conference with his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, after they signed a UK-Germany defence pact.</p> <p><em>Noon:</em> Angela Rayner, the deputy PM, faces Oliver Dowden, the shadow deputy PM, at PMQs.</p> <p><em>After 12.30pm:</em> MPs debate regulations relating to the infected blood compensation scheme.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media.

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has insisted he wants to \u201clook forward\u201d rather than have \u201cvery long endless discussions about reparations on the past\u201d in his first comments on the issue before the Commonwealth summit. Keir Starmer has insisted he can maintain a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Donald Trump after the Republican candidate\u2019s campaign accused Labour of \u201cblatant foreign interference\u201d in the US election. A member of the shadow cabinet, John Lamont, accused Labour of a \u201cdiplomatic car crash\u201d. (See 2.42pm.) But Robert Buckland, a former Tory justice secretary, defended Labour and said that he had been campaigning for the Democrats himself because he thought Trump was \u201cnot fit for office\u201d. (See 5.32pm.) Alastair Campbell, the former Labour communications chief, said the whole row was just an attempt by the Trump campaign to distract attention from the fact Trump\u2019s former chief of staff has described him as a fascist who in private has praised Hitler. (See 1.51pm.) There is more on this story in our US election extra podcast. The identities of armed police officers charged after opening fire at suspects are likely to stay secret in future unless they are convicted, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has announced. Labour is considering making solar panels optional on new homes in England, after pressure from housebuilders, in a move that would weaken low-carbon regulations, the Guardian has learned. Kemi Badenoch, favourite in the Tory leadership contest, has said that she is a \u201cnet zero sceptic\u201d and suggested that an adaption strategy might be a better solution to the climate crisis than just focusing on cutting carbon emissions. (See 3.58pm.) Ben Wallace, the Conservative former defence secretary, has criticised the Trinity House Agreement, the defence pact agreed with Germany. (See 5.06pm.) He posted these on social media. If the new UK/ German \u201cTrinity House\u201d agreement is to mean anything then Germany would have agreed with UK requests to send Taurus to Ukraine AND they would lift any export veto on potential Typhoon sales to Turkey - a Nato member. Otherwise it is pretty hollow 1/2 and made up of stuff we are already doing or had started. This has more to do with \u201cSPD is our sister party\u201d than real military mutual benefit. It does however confirm that Kier Starmer is the UK\u2019s own Olaf Scholz ! -2/2 Labour is not the only party with members who have been out in the US actively campaigning to stop Donald Trump being elected. Robert Buckland, the Conservative former justice secretary, has been campaigning for Democrats in the US too. In an interview with Radio 4\u2019s PM programme, Buckland said that Trump was \u201cnot fit for office\u201d and that he thought the Trump campaign\u2019s complaint about Labour was just \u201ca bit of electioneering\u201d rather than a serious allegation about a breach of the rules. Buckland said that he was in the US in September as part of a Havard fellowship, but while he was there he decided to visit friends in Connecticut who were standing as Democracts in various state, congressional and senate elections. \u201cSo I went out on the stump to see what it was all about and do a bit of campaigning.\u201d Explaining why he was opposed to Trump, he said: I\u2019m free to say what I like. I\u2019m a member of the public now, and I\u2019m not in a government \u2026 I feel that the record of Donald Trump in the presidency is an affront to those who believe in traditional Republicanism. His behavior around 6 January [the attack on Capitol in 2021] makes it clear to me he\u2019s not somebody who believes in the rule of law either and is not fit for office. Asked about the complaint about Labour activists, Buckland said: \u201cI do think that this is a bit of electioneering.\u201d He said the LinkedIn message by a Labour staff encouraging people to volunteer \u201cmight have given a false impression there was an organised visit here being funded, which I don\u2019t think is the case at all\u201d. But Buckland did accept that the perception that there was an organised Labour operation going on was \u201cdamaging\u201d. The UK and Germany failed to respond to the threat posed by Vladimir Putin for too long, Berlin\u2019s defence minister said as the two countries signed a new co-operation agreement. As PA Media reports, the deal is a way of strengthening European security at a time when the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House could see US military resources diverted away from the Nato alliance. Speaking at a press conference alongside John Healey, the defence secretary, the German defence minister Boris Pistorius said the allies had failed to respond to the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and were now being forced to catch up in the wake of the full-scale war in Ukraine. I always stress that the Baltics and Scandinavian countries, they woke up (in) 2014 to the annexation of the Crimea. We woke up, too: Germany, Britain, France and other countries in Europe; but what we did was we pushed the snooze button and turned around. All the other countries stayed awake, and they did what was necessary to do. And so we lost almost eight years and have now to speed up. Healey said European nations needed to take \u201cmore responsibility for the heavy lifting and the leadership within the Nato alliance\u201d. Commenting on the deal, known as the UK-Germany Trinity House Agreement, the said: The Trinity House Agreement is a milestone moment in our relationship with Germany and a major strengthening of Europe\u2019s security. It secures unprecedented levels of new cooperation with the German Armed Forces and industry, bringing benefits to our shared security and prosperity, protecting our shared values and boosting our defence industrial bases. As PA reports, under the deal, , German submarine-hunting planes will operate from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and arms giant Rheinmetall is set to open a factory producing artillery gun barrels using British steel. Defence AI firm Helsing will also make a \u00a3350 million investment in the UK. The two countries will also collaborated on developing long-range, strike weapons that can travel further than the UK\u2019s existing Storm Shadow missiles, and on new land-based and aerial drones. The text of the agreement is here and the joint communique is here. Kemi Badenoch has said lots of commentators \u201cdo not understand downward social mobility\u201d. She made the comment in her interview with Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast, when she was asked about her claim that she was working class when she came to the UK as a teenager and had a job in McDonald\u2019s while she was also attending school. Badenoch was mocked for the claim when she first made it because she had a middle-class upbringing in Nigeria, where her father was a doctor and her mother a professor of physiology. But at the Tory conference she doubled down, saying that it was not working at McDonald\u2019s that made her working class, but that because she was working class at that stage in her life she ended up doing that job. (Badenoch implied it was like a main job, and that she was so poor she had to work; another account, in a biography of Badenoch published by Lord Ashcroft, says it was a part-time job, and that Badenoch did not need to work because her food and rent were being paid for.) Badenoch told Robinson that the controversy generated by her remarks showed how some journalists did not understand downward social mobility. She explained: A lot of people in the commentariat classes do not understand downward social mobility, and they think that where you are is what you are and that\u2019s that, and people don\u2019t move between them. But my understanding of class as it is today is that it is different from what it was during Downton Abbey. People actually do move in between them and, given the level of migration that we\u2019ve had into the country, the old class system doesn\u2019t work and people like me don\u2019t fit into it. How many people have you met who are doctors in their country who are driving cabs here, for example, what class are they? And if you are trying to shoehorn people into an outdated class system, you\u2019re going to run into trouble. Describing her situation now, Badenoch, who is married to a banker, said that she would describe herself as \u201ccomfortable\u201d, but added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re rich.\u201d Kemi Badenoch, the favourite in the Conservative leadership contest, may wait up to two years before coming up with detailed policies, it has been reported. In his Daily Mail interview with her, Jason Groves writes: If she wins \u2026 Mrs Badenoch plans to spend up to two years \u2018renewing\u2019 the party before coming forward with a detailed policy platform. In her Political Thinking podcast interview, Badenoch said she would use policy commissions to decide where the party will go next. I have said that we are going to set up just like David Cameron did, and just like Margaret Thatcher did, policy commissions where we\u2019re going to pick each of these issues through. We\u2019re going to have an internal debate within the party and then we\u2019re going to come to a conclusion and unite behind it. She also said that she would not force shadow cabinet ministers to agree with her on policy from the start. She said: What I\u2019m not doing is what my opponent [Robert Jenrick] has done and said, \u2018I have these ideas and people are going to need to sign up to them if they\u2019re in this, if they go into the shadow cabinet.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that you can get a party together that way. Politics is not like other businesses. It is something that requires consensus. You can\u2019t sack the people who are there. They\u2019re still going to be there. So you need to bring people together. Badenoch herself first got properly involved with the Conservative party contributing to a policy commission on globalisation and global poverty, chaired by Peter Lilley. Kemi Badenoch, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, has repeatedly been accused of avoiding the media by her opponent, Robert Jenrick. But in the last 24 hours or so she has done two biggish interviews \u2013 with Nick Robinson, for his BBC Political Thinking podcast, and with Jason Groves, political editor of the Daily Mail. In the interviews Badenoch said that she is a \u201cnet zero sceptic\u201d and suggested that an adaption strategy might be a better solution to the climate crisis than just focusing on cutting carbon emissions. In the write-up of his interview, Groves also said Badenoch \u201cdoes not completely rule out revisiting the 2050 net target [the UK government\u2019s legal pledge to get net carbons emissions down to zero by 2050]\u201d, but Groves did not include a direct quote from Badenoch on this. Speaking to Robinson, Badenoch said she was a net zero sceptic, but not a climate change sceptic. She said she accepted there was a problem to be addressed, but that she was not convinced net zero was the solution. What I\u2019m saying is that climate change is a serious issue that needs work. But what strategy should we pick? We could pick an adaptation strategy, that this is going to happen. How do we build lives that will work within that? We\u2019ve chosen the strategy, which is to reduce carbon emissions. There is no guarantee that that will work. I want to see something, if we are going down that path, something that has other benefits. So energy security. Badenoch said that, for her, the question was: \u201cIs net zero a solution or is it a slogan?\u201d She implied she thought it was more of the latter. If you have a target and you can\u2019t meet it, it\u2019s not real. Just putting something in law doesn\u2019t make it real. And she also said that her experience of growing up in Nigeria, when there were regular power cuts even though the country was energy rich, helped to explain why she was a net zero sceptic. I am a net zero sceptic \u2026 because I grew up somewhere where the lights didn\u2019t come on, where we ran out of fuel frequently, despite being an oil producing country, there was often petrol scarcity. That is when a system is broken and I see us making similar decisions here. Let\u2019s do something because it looks good, before we figured out how to do it, let\u2019s make an announcement and I don\u2019t want us doing that. I will post more lines from Badenoch\u2019s interviews shortly. The Department for Work and Pensions has published a document explaining how it will go about drawing up a child poverty strategy. The plan will shape the work of its child poverty taskforce. According to the document, the work will focus on four themes. 1) Increasing incomes: Examining how government and business can work together to support parents into secure employment, and support progression in the labour market, building on our plans to Make Work Pay and to Get Britain Working. This will include childcare as a key enabler of parental employment. We will consider how social security reforms could support people into work and help alleviate poverty. 2) Reducing essential costs: Working with business and organisations to understand and tackle the key cost drivers for low-income families (such as housing, energy, food). Looking at where these costs are a barrier to education and employment (like childcare and transport), including addressing the poverty premium and where increased costs of disability exacerbates poverty. 3) Increasing financial resilience: Working with a range of stakeholders, including financial institutions, charities, and consumer representatives to find solutions to problem debt and enabling families to build savings \u2026 4) Better local support, focussed especially on children\u2019s early years: Our society, through our local institutions and our local communities, is at the heart of tackling the impacts of poverty. The document also gives some details of how employers, unions, thinktanks and other experts will be consulted by the taskforce over the coming months. In their legal complaint about Labour activists campaigning for the Democrats, Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers quote newspaper reports saying Morgan McSweeney, who is now Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, and Matthew Doyle, Starmer\u2019s communications chief, went to the Democrats\u2019 convention to advise Kamala Harris\u2019s team. As Steven Swinford from the Times reports, Labour says McSweeney and Doyle were not there as advisers. Labour denies Morgan McSweeney, Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, and Matthew Doyle, his director of communications, advised the Harris campaign team when they attended the DNC convention in August They confirm that McSweeney\u2019s costs were paid for by the Labour Party and that Doyle\u2019s costs were met by the Progressive Policy Institute, a Democrat thinktank. Donald Trump\u2019s six-page filing directly accuses them of trying to \u2018exercise direction and control over elements of Harris\u2019s campaign\u2019, in breach of US federal law John Lamont, shadow Scottish secretary, told Radio 4\u2019s the World at One that the Trump team complaint about Labour activists campaigning in the US was \u201ca diplomatic car crash\u201d for the government. He said: It\u2019s a diplomatic car crash by this Labour government. There\u2019s now somebody who could potentially be the next president of the United States who\u2019s lodged an official complaint with the American authorities about the Labour party, the Labour government, and their involvement in their election \u2026 If Donald Trump were to win for the election in a few weeks, how on earth is the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, going to rebuild that relationship with one of the most important countries in the world, not least from a diplomatic perspective, but also from a trading perspective. The culture minister Chris Bryant, who was being interviewed alongside Lamont, responded: What a load of hyperbole and exaggeration. I think the Conservative party in opposition is going to have to learn how to not sound so shrill. Bryant said that there was nothing unusual about activists volunteering in foreign election campaigns. And he said in this case people were going to the America in their own time, at their own expense, without Labour funding. He said the story was \u201ca massive fuss about nothing\u201d. Pointing out that Liz Truss went to the Republican convention to support Donald Trump, he told Lamont the Tories were guilty of \u201carrant hypocrisy\u201d. Lamont said there was no complaint about Truss going to the Republican convention, but that in this case there was a complaint about the party in government. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has told MPs that the identities of armed police officers charged after opening fire at suspects are likely to stay secret in future unless they are convicted. Vikram Dodd has the story. Daniel Knowles, an Economist correspondent in the US, agrees with the Alastair Campbell analysis. (See 1.35pm.) He has posted these on Bluesky. Sorry but nobody in America gives a shit about a few Labour activists door-knocking or whatever. The Trump complaint is entirely cynical, and one of dozens of random speculative press releases I was sent yesterday. I\u2019m not surprised British media is as ever just fucking delighted for a local angle The story here isn\u2019t \u201cis door knocking actually an illegal contribution,\u201d, etc. The legitimate UK angle to cover is, \u201cDonald Trump will pick massive fights with the British government over nothing if it wins him a nice headline.\u201d Which we know, from his conduct in office This is the same Donald Trump who is currently doing private diplomacy with Benjamin Netanyahu and (he didn\u2019t deny when asked by Bloomberg last week) Vladimir Putin. He also isn\u2019t being transparent at all about who is buying &amp; what money he getting from his random commercial licensing deals atm Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief who now co-hosts the Rest is Politics podcast, told Radio 4\u2019s the World at One that the Trump allegations about the Labour party were just an attempt to distract attention from other campaign stories, like Trump\u2019s former chief of staff calling him a fascist. It was a \u201cnon-story\u201d, Campbell told the programme: I think it\u2019s one of the biggest non-stories of this campaign. And I\u2019ll tell you why. Because the one thing I will give to the Trump campaign, they are very good at divert and distract, and the media tend to fall for their diversions and distractions all the time. We have just had a situation where the former chief of staff, who worked with Donald Trump more than any other chief of staff, has warned the American people that if they vote for Trump, they\u2019re electing a fascist. Now is that more or less significant? Is this situation more or less significant than the Russian interference that we had last time around? Is it more or less significant than the Musk millions that are being poured into this? What Angela Rayner said [at PMQs \u2013 see 12.17pm] is right. Since time immemorial, people on the right have gone to America to support Republican candidates. People on the left and the centre-left have gone to support Democrats. There is no evidence whatsoever of the Labour party using resources or money [to campaign for the Democrats]. Campbell was referring to John Kelly, a former general who was Trump\u2019s chief of staff between 2017 and 2019. Kelly made his comments in an interview with the New York Times. Asked if Trump was a fascist, Kelly told the paper: Well, looking at the definition of fascism: It\u2019s a far-right authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy \u2026 So certainly, in my experience, those are the kinds of things that he thinks would work better in terms of running America \u2026 Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he\u2019s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators \u2014 he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure \u2026 He certainly prefers the dictator approach to government. Kelly also told the New York Times he had heard Trump praise Hitler. Kelly said: [Trump] commented more than once that, \u2018You know, Hitler did some good things, too.\u2019 As Chris Stein reports on this blog\u2019s US equivalent, the Trump campaign are dismissing Kelly\u2019s comments. John Healey, the defence secretary, has said the Labour government is determined to have a good relationship with the next US administration, whichever party is in power. Speaking at a press conference this morning, he defended the right of activists to volunteer in the US election, and argued that having Labour people campaigning for Kamala Harris should not affect relations with a possible Donald Trump administration. Healey said: Any individual Labour supporters that are over in the US, being part of the Democratic election campaign, are there as individuals. They\u2019re there at their own time. They\u2019re there at their own expense, and if they\u2019ve got accommodation out there that will be also provided by volunteers. This happens in every election. It\u2019s commonplace. It is very different to the determination and the way the government will work with whoever the American people elect next month as their president. And just as the UK and the US have a special, deep relationship, and have had for decades, that\u2019s a relationship that has withstood the political ups and downs on both sides of the Atlantic, and we\u2019re determined to make that work in the future. In an interview this morning Healey suggested that the Republican legal complaint was just an election gimmick. (See 10.33am.) Asked if it was still his view that the Republicans were just \u201ccreating controversy\u201d, Healey replied: This is in the middle of an election campaign. That\u2019s the way that politics works. You\u2019ve been around almost as long as I have. These are volunteers doing their bit, gaining a bit of experience out there, but doing so as individuals. It is nice to see politicians from opposing parties being nice about each other for a change, but maybe Angela Rayner and Oliver Dowden were taking the bonhomie just a little too far. John Crace, who as the Guardian\u2019s sketch writer is paid to take the mick, sounds a bit discombulated by it all. This PMQs between Angela Rayner and Oliver Dowden was almost tender And Tom Harwood from GB News was pitched into \u2018get a room\u2019 mode watching. This flirting is getting out of hand. They were set off by this exchange in particular. Dowden, a diehard monarchist (even by Conservative party standards), ended his questions sucking up to the king, but he started with the budget, and the charge that raising employers\u2019 national insurance (something Rachel Reeves has not ruled out) would clobber small business owners. On another day, he might have made some progress with this. But Dowden is expecting to be out of the shadow cabinet by the end of next week, and Rayner\u2019s not chancellor or PM, and somehow it felt that he was not really trying. And, even if he had been, Rayner\u2019s opening joke about Dowden\u2019s pushing for an early election \u2013 \u201cif his own side hasn\u2019t offered him a peerage, I certainly will\u201d \u2013 was so good it would have knocked him off course anyway. Otherwise, it was all rather unremarkable. The best question came from the SNP\u2019s Stephen Flynn. (See 12.17pm.) And the worst questions? Hard to say, but it was not just King Charles getting the sycophancy treatment, and the number of \u2018Isn\u2019t the government brilliant?\u2019 questions asked by Labour MPs seemed a bit higher than usual. It is hard to know if that is just an impression, or whether No 10 is tightening up on message discipline under the new Morgan McSweeney regime. John Hayes (Con) says onshore windfarms are a threat to farmland in his Lincolnshire constituency. He says energy security should not compromise food security. Rayner says the government is committed to energy security. Kim Johnson (Lab) asks about a hospice threatened with closure in her constituency. Does Rayner agree they should get statutory funding, not just charity funding? Rayner says the government is aware of the importance of hospices. She promises a ministerial meeting on this. Rachel Blake (Lab) asks if Rayner agrees that the renters\u2019 rights bill will transform opportunities for renters. Rayner does agree with that. James MacCleary (Lib Dem) asks what the government is doing to cut Brexit red tape for businesses. Rayner says the government is turning the page on its relationship with Europe. It wants to tear down unnecessary barriers to trade. But that won\u2019t involve rejoining the single market or customs union, she says. Anna Dixon (Lab) says the employment rights bill will help care workers. Rayner says, as a former care worker, she will always champion care workers. They will get a fair pay agreement that will give them the recognition they deserve, she says. Asked about support for farmers affected by flooding, Rayner says the government inherited a flood defence system that was inadequate. Meg Hillier (Lab) asks if Rayner will take a personal interest in ensuring that unsafe cladding gets removed from buildings more quickly. Rayner says she is taking an interest in this. She will ensure action is taken, she says. Mike Tapp (Lab) says two more people have died trying to cross the Channel in a small boat. What is the government doing to stop these crossings? Rayner says the government has set up Border Security Command to break up the gangs behind these crossings. Carolyn Harris (Lab) asks if Rayner will join her in welcoming the appointment of Mariella Frostrup as a menopause employment adviser. Rayner does welcome this, and says the government wants to help conditions for menopausal women. Rayner says the humanitarian situation in Northern Gaza is \u201cdire\u201d. She says much more aid needs to get in. The government has concluded that arms sent to Israel could contravene humanitarian obligations in Gaza, she says. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks if Rayner will join him in applauding \u201cthe brave Labour staff members\u2019\u201d who have gone to the US to campaign against Donald Trump. Rayner says there are people from all parties who cross the Atlantic to campaign in their own time, with their own money. UPDATE: Flynn said: Will the deputy prime minister join me in applauding the brave Labour staff members who travelled across the Atlantic to campaign against Donald Trump? And Rayner replied: People in their own time often go and campaign, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen. It happens in all political parties, people go and campaign and they do what they want to do with their own time, with their own money. Daisy Cooper, the deputy Lib Dem leader, asks if the government will consider her party\u2019s idea for a winter taskforce for the NHS to ensure that more care places are available for people leaving hospital. Rayner says the government does want to improve care, and get the NHS back on its feet. Cooper says the Lib Dems will work with the government as a \u201cconstructive opposition\u201d. But 18,000 small care providers would be affected if employers\u2019 national insurance goes up. Rayner says she will not speculate on the budget. But it will a budget to rebuild Britain, she says. Rachael Maskell (Lab) asks if the government will set up a commission to consider how everyone who needs it can get proper end-of-life palliative care. Rayner says, from her time as a carer, she knows how important this is. She says she will arrange a meeting with a minister for Maskell about this. Dowden jokes about the Commonwealth being an organisation of countries united by a common culture, like him and Rayner. Rayner says, while the Tories are fighting among themselves, Labour is rebuilding Britain. Dowden says business owners will be worried by Rayner\u2019s answers. He says he wants to use his final questions to Rayner to ask her to join him in praising the king and the work he has done with the Commonwealth. Rayner says she is happy to join him in praising that. Dowden asks if Rayner agrees that working people will pay if employers\u2019 national insurance goes up. Those are her words, he says. Rayner again says working people were let down by the Tories. Dowden claims Rayner is saying small business owners aren\u2019t working people. But they will be affected if the government puts up employers\u2019 national insurance, he says. Rayner says the Tory approach to business was \u201cf\u2026 business\u201d. Dowden asks if the five million people who own small businesses are working people. Rayner says people like that were let down when the Tories crashed the economy. Oliver Dowden, the shadow deputy PM, asks Rayner how she defines working people. Rayner starts by saying this is their first PMQs together since Dowden pushed for an early election. If the Tories do not give him a peerage, she will, she says. She says working people are people let down by the Tories. Angela Rayner starts by saying Keir Starmer will be discussing shared economic opportunities at the Commonwealth summit. She says the UK has today signed a defence agreement with Germany. And she expresses her support for Chris Hoy, the Olympic cyclist who has disclosed his terminal cancer, and expresses sympathy for the victims of the train crash in Wales. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. With Keir Starmer flying to Samoa for the Commonwealth summit, Angela Rayner, the deputy PM, is taking PMQs. Lord Alli, the Labour donor, has been ordered to write a letter of apology after a Lords committeed found he had committed four \u201cminor\u201d breaches of the rules relating to registering interests. Three of them related to interests that Alli believed he did not need to register for technical reasons, and the fourth was in interest that was registered late. In a report, the Lords commissioner for standards, Martin Jelley, says: I consider these to be minor breaches for which remedial action is appropriate \u2026 While I consider each individual breach of the code to be minor, I have found there to be four breaches in total, and have therefore recommended that Lord Alli write a letter of apology to the chair of the conduct committee, Baroness Manningham-Buller. Alli\u2019s apology is included as an appendix in the report. In it he says: I am writing to you today to offer my apology for my breach of conduct by not registering my interests correctly. I will endeavour to keep to the Code of Conduct at all times to avoid such circumstances again. Alli is the donor who contributed clothing, accommodation and glasses to Keir Starmer before the general election, which became embarrassing when reports about the extent of what Starmer was getting were published over the summer, at the same time as the government was cutting the winter fuel payment for pensioners. The Labour party has put out a statement rejecting allegations that it broke US election law because activists and staff members have been volunteering to help the Democrats. A Labour spokesperson said: It is common practice for campaigners of all political persuasions from around the world to volunteer in US elections. Where Labour activists take part, they do so at their own expense, in accordance with the laws and rules. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has said that \u201cthe main taxes that working people pay\u201d will not be going up in the budget. In an interview with Matt Chorley for his Radio 5 Live show being broadcast this afternoon, asked if people earning more than \u00a3100,000 would have to pay more tax under the measures in next week\u2019s budget, Reeves replied: We said that because working people had already paid the burden under the last government, we wouldn\u2019t increase the taxes, the main taxes that working people pay, so income tax - all rates - national insurance and VAT. So those taxes that working people pay, we\u2019re not increasing those taxes in the budget. She also said there would be no return to austerity. We go into this budget with a number of challenges - the \u00a322bn black hole just this year, in the public finances, the unfinanced company compensation schemes, for example on infected blood and Horizon, it\u2019s really important that we honour but they weren\u2019t in the forecasts from the previous government. The fact that the previous government had baked in austerity to our public spending settlements in the years to come, and we committed to not return to austerity. And so all of those things mean that, yes, we do need to find additional money. Greg Swenson, chair of Republicans Overseas UK, has said that, even if the Labour volunteering effort for the Democrats was not illegal, it was a mistake. In an interview on Times Radio, asked if the initiative would backfired, he replied: It\u2019s hard to disagree with that. It is election interference. I think it\u2019s a mistake. I think it will backfire not only on the Democrats here, on Kamala Harris, but I think it will backfire on Labour in some respects. So, yeah, I think it\u2019s uncool. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s illegal, but I think it\u2019s uncool. He also claimed it was unfair to compare what the Labour volunteers were doing with Nigel Farage backing Donald Trump. He said: [Trump and Farage] have been friends a long time. So the fact that Nigel supports Trump is just because they were friends long before the recent election. So anyway, I think it\u2019s apples and oranges. And I don\u2019t think it ends up hurting Trump to have him. The health secretary Wes Streeting is to vote against the assisted dying bill, saying he had concluded that end-of-life care was currently not fit to deliver it safely. Speaking to Labour backbenchers, Streeting said he had initially believed in the right to choose by terminally ill patients but said that he had changed his mind given the degraded state of the health service. The move by the health secretary is likely to seed some doubt among MPs ahead of the free vote at the end of November. The justice secretary Shabana Mahmood has also said she will vote against the bill from the backbencher Kim Leadbeater, citing her faith as a reason to oppose it. She told The Times that she had an \u201cunshakeable belief in the sanctity and the value of human life\u201d. Keir Starmer, whose mother suffered from a degenerative illness, has said he is in favour of assisted dying and had promised there would be a parliamentary vote \u2013 though said it should come via a private members\u2019 bill. Streeting has previously spoken publicly about his doubts about legalising assisted dying, but confirmed his decision to vote against in comments at the Labour PLP meeting on Monday night, according to the Times. Sources close to Streeting confirmed that was his decision. Cabinet ministers have been told they are allowed to express an opinion on the matter but have been cautioned against getting involved heavily in one side of the debate. Leadbeater\u2019s bill, which will be debated on 29 November, would restrict assisted dying to terminally ill patients and requires two doctors and a judge to sign off the procedure. Streeting told the FT Weekend festival earlier this year that he was unusually torn over the decision \u2013 having voted for it in the past. He told the FT Weekend Festival last month: Underneath that philosophical ethical question are a whole series of practical ones about which I am deeply uncomfortable. Candidly, when I think about this question of being a burden, I do not think that palliative care, end-of-life care in this country is in a condition yet where we are giving people the freedom to choose, without being coerced by the lack of support available. That is one of the reasons why I can buy into the principle and think about people in my own life who have really suffered at the end of life and not want to impose my views on assisted dying as to whether they should have a choice. But I am not sure as a country we have the right end-of-life care available to enable a real choice on assisted dying. John Healey, the defence secretary, has suggested that the Trump campaign complaints about Labour are little more than an electoral stunt. As the BBC reports, Healey told BBC Radio Sheffield that the Trump campaign \u201cgot this wrong\u201d and that there was no organised effort to interfer with the election, against electoral law. Healey said the people going to the US were individual Labour members. He added: There\u2019s no organised deal on this - they\u2019re all volunteers, they pay their way \u2026 This is Trump\u2019s campaign doing what campaigns do, creating controversy during an election. Healey also said Labour would \u201cwork with whatever president the American people elect\u201d. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader who has spoken in support of Donald Trump at rallies in the US, has claimed that when a Labour official encouraged people working for the party to volunteer in support of Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign, that was against US law. Speaking on GB News, Farage said: They have perfectly clear rules that whilst people from overseas can come take part in campaigns, make statements, appear on media, all things incidentally that I\u2019ve done over the years, what they can\u2019t do is do it if they\u2019re being funded. Now, the important thing about the LinkedIn advert that went out to Labour employees and supporters is no mention was made that you\u2019d have to pay your own air fare. No mention was made that you\u2019d have to take time off work and not have your salary paid. And of course, on top of that, they were told free accommodation would be provided. If you take that at face value, it is a very clear breach of American electoral law, and that is what the Trump campaign is complaining about. Farage also said that, when he spoke at a major Trump rally in 2016, he made a point of telling the audience he was not telling them how to vote. And he was not paid, he says. But in the register of members\u2019 interests Farage declares as a donation worth \u00a332,836 flights and accommodation paying for him to visit the Republican convention in July. Under purpose of the visit, he says: \u201cTo support a friend who was almost killed and to represent Clacton on the world stage.\u201d The donation was from a British cryptocurrency investor, Christopher Harborne. And, as Rowena Mason revealed in the Guardian last week, in the register Farage did not mention the free PR support he got from a Republican PR firm during the trip, or the fact that the company settled his $3,531.10 hotel bill. Opinion in the commentator class is divided as to whether the Trump/Labour election interference row is just largely confected nonsense, or whether it is really quite serious. In his Inside Politics briefing for the Financial Times, Stephen Bush inclines to the latter view. Here is an excerpt. Keir Starmer is wholly correct when he says it is normal for Labour party staffers and former Labour party staffers to volunteer their own time in US presidential campaigns. But the big and important difference now is that Donald Trump is a very different kind of politician. In the unlikely event that Poilievre loses the next Canadian general election, Justin Trudeau, leader of the Liberals, would not freeze out a Jenrick-led British government. Clinton and John Major worked well on a range of issues, as did Tony Blair and George W Bush. Trump is mercurial, unpredictable and chaotic. If Trump does return to the White House in November, that will, I think, be the defining moment in the life of the Labour government. Any hope of a return to \u201cnormal\u201d politics will die alongside Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential ambitions. Starmer\u2019s government will have to find a new way of approaching the US-UK relationship: and what has, until now, been a \u201cnormal\u201d exchange of volunteers between the two countries\u2019 major centre-left parties may soon become a major diplomatic liability. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has said that when he accepted free football tickets from a company last year, he did not know it was owned by a firm that owns most of Northumbria Water. Reed accepted the tickets, donated by a phone company, last year, when he was shadow environment secretary. In an interview with Sky News this morning, asked if he knew that CK Hutchison Holdings, who donated the tickets, owned 75% of CK Infrastructure Holdings, the owner of Northumbrian Water, Reed replied: There was nobody from a water company that was involved in offering those tickets. There was nobody from a water company at that event. Asked if he would take the tickets again, Reed replied: I probably wouldn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t know at the time and it hasn\u2019t influenced a single decision that I\u2019ve taken. Asked why he would not do the same thing again, he told the presenter, Kay Burley: The implication, Kay, is it somehow influences the decisions that I\u2019m taking \u2026 I wasn\u2019t aware that there was any relationship with a water company. Water wasn\u2019t discussed even for one second at that event. I\u2019m doing the best by the public: The things that we said we do in the general election. My intention is to reset a failing water sector so it serves customers and the environment in a way it hasn\u2019t done for decades. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has said that Britain will start running short of drinking water in about 10 years if action is not taken to improve infrastructure. In an interview with LBC to defend the need for the review of the water industry he is launching today, Reed said: The lack of water infrastructure is now holding back economic growth in this country, so we can\u2019t build the homes that we need in parts of the country. Cambridge, for instance, lacks clean water supply. Oxford lacks sewage systems sufficient to allowed house building to go ahead. And a third point here is that by the mid-2030s unless we take action to increase water supply \u2013 reservoirs as well as infrastructure \u2013 then the demand for drinking water will start to outstrip supply, in a way that already happens in some Mediterranean countries. We cannot allow the water system, the water sector, to continue in this way. Good morning. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has been doing the morning interview round, and he expected to be talking about the appointment of an independent commission, led by the former Treasury official and former deputy governor of the Bank of England Sir Jon Cunliffe, to consider the future of the water industry. Details were briefed out last night, here is the news release, and here is Helena Horton\u2019s story. But instead Reed has spent the morning fending off a rather bizarre story about the Trump campaign filing a complaint with election regulators in the US alleging that the Labour party is interfering in the US presidential election. Eleni Courea has the details here. In an interview with the Today programme, Reed said that it was \u201cperfectly normal\u201d for political activists to volunteer in election campaigns in other countries. In an interview with the Today programme, he said: It\u2019s up to private individuals what they do with their free time, and it\u2019s actually perfectly normal for people who are interested in politics to go from one country to campaign for a sister party in another country. I\u2018ve seen Americans in the UK doing that in our elections. He also said the pro-Democrat volunteering effort had not been official organised or funded by the Labour party. None of this has been organised or paid for by the Labour party. This is just individuals using their own time and their own money. Asked about a post on LinkedIn from Sofia Patel, head of operations at the Labour party, inviting more people to volunteer and saying their housing would be sorted out, Reed said Today programme would have to be speak to her, but \u201cthe Labour party has nothing to do with organising this\u201d. When it was put to him that the fact that the post has been taken down was an admission that it was badly worded, Reed just said he had not seen it. Reed is right, of course. Volunteering like this is routine (Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, helped out with the Bill Clinton campaign at one stage in 1992), and the Trump campaign don\u2019t seem too bothered about British inteference when the person doing the interfering is Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader. In one respect, the most interesting feature of the story is the fact that Donald Trump and his campaign team appear to be the only people on the planet who think that Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party is \u201cfar left\u201d. But Trump may well win the US presidential election in two weeks\u2019 time and, although Starmer has been scrupulous about being respectful towards him as PM, and describes their relationship as \u201cgood\u201d, Trump is unpredictable and vindictive, and so this could be a story with repercussions. Starmer is spending all day travelling to the Commonwealth summit in Samoa, so we are not going to hear much more from him on this. But we\u2019ve got PMQs, and so the topic may come up there. Here is the agenda for the day. 11.30am: John Healey, the defence secretary, holds a press conference with his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, after they signed a UK-Germany defence pact. Noon: Angela Rayner, the deputy PM, faces Oliver Dowden, the shadow deputy PM, at PMQs. After 12.30pm: MPs debate regulations relating to the infected blood compensation scheme.

The US company Wolfspeed and the German car parts supplier ZF have postponed plans to build an EV chip factory, adding to problems caused by a delay to two large-scale factories belonging to the US chip giant Intel and possible factory closures being considered by Volkswagen. Wolfspeed and ZF have put the project, in Ensdorf, in the western state of Saarland, on hold due to disappointing consumer demand. The US company said that \u201csolid progress\u201d in production at its domestic factories had also led to the decision to suspend the German plans. \u201cWith our improved productivity, coupled with the currently forecasted slower ramp of the EV marketplace, we believe we have the capacity we need for the foreseeable future,\u201d a company spokesperson said. A ZF spokesperson said it had been the US company that had taken the decision not to move ahead with construction, which was originally slated to begin in summer 2023 and eventually employ up to 1,000 people. \u201cAfter Wolfspeed delayed the factory project in Ensdorf indefinitely, the planned Wolfspeed-ZF cooperation on the factory is now on ice,\u201d the spokesperson said in an statement. The suspension of the project compounds the bleak national economic outlook signalled by the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday. The organisation said German economic growth would flatline this year and climb just 0.8% in 2025, making it the worst performer among highly industrialised countries. A slowdown in demand for electric vehicles has sent a chill through the European manufacturing sector, causing a further headache for carmakers, including Wolfsburg-based Volkswagen, struggling to adapt to the transition away from fossil fuels. Last month, Intel said it would delay work on two big factories in the eastern German city of Magdeburg, planned at a cost of \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn), for which it agreed \u20ac10bn in subsidies with the German government. The company cited a cost-cutting drive, due to global complications in boosting semiconductor production, for the freeze in plans intended to make Europe less dependent on Asia in the sector. In February 2023, Wolfspeed and ZF said in the presence of Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the economy minister, Robert Habeck, they would build the \u201cworld\u2019s largest, most advanced\u201d silicon carbide components factory at a cost of \u20ac2.75bn. Federal and state subsidies were slated to amount to \u20ac515m. At the time, Scholz hailed the project as part of a \u201creturn of the industrial revolution\u201d to Germany. The newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine reported that, in addition to slack demand, Wolfspeed had been hit by technical difficulties at its US plants and experienced a dramatic slump in its share price in the last two years. ZF, whose electromobility division has reported severe problems, plans to cut a quarter of its 54,000-strong German workforce by 2028 in the face of slow demand for EVs. It had planned to contribute about \u20ac170m to the Wolfspeed joint venture. The suspension of the plant project is also a severe setback for the small state of Saarland, on the French border, which had undergone a successful transformation over several decades away from coal mining and weathered the steel crisis, with the help of the automotive industry. The Ensdorf research and development centre had been scheduled to be built on the site of a former coal-fired power plant. The US carmaker Ford recently announced plans to stop production in the state. Scholz, a Social Democrat whose three-way coalition has been hobbled by infighting and sinking popularity, has been attempting to jumpstart the flagging German economy in cooperation with industry. On Wednesday, the magazine Der Spiegel ran an article with the stark headline \u201cIs mass unemployment coming back?\u201d, citing fears of the kind of catastrophic slump last seen in the early years of the millennium, as companies including BASF, Thyssenkrupp and Miele cut well-paid positions.

      "body": "<p>Erin Kellem\u2019s Asheville, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a> neighborhood is a short drive from the city center, but feels remote. The Haw Creek area\u2019s culs-de-sac are fronted by spacious yards and surrounded by thick woods that give the illusion of isolation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene\">Hurricane Helene</a> changed that, dropping an ocean of rain on the southern Appalachian mountains. Floods of biblical proportions killed dozens. Power outages left thousands without electricity for at least two weeks in most places. There was no gas or cellphone service for days following the storm, and most of the city is still without potable water. Roads disappeared under rushing water and mud. The help that was on its way had no way in, and those stranded in their homes had no way of checking on loved ones.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone in the neighborhood with a chainsaw came out to help clear the roads,\u201d said Kellem, whose family has lived in Haw Creek for 22 years. \u201cWhen it became obvious that we weren\u2019t getting power back any time soon and our freezers were beginning to thaw, we collectively said: \u2018Well, what do we have in our freezers? And what can we all make with it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Like so many around town, Kellem and her neighbors dug through their fridges and freezers, pooled their wilting veggies and thawed meats to feed one another.</p> <p>\u201cOur neighbors told us they were also planning what they called a \u2018freezer burn\u2019, and told us to bring a grill or camp stove if we had one,\u201d said Taylor Aurilio, who lives near the Smith Mill Creek neighborhood, on the western side of the city.</p> <p>\u201cI think they were expecting maybe a dozen people, but it ended up being about 30 people. Neighbors were wheeling their grills down from their houses, bringing all the meat from their freezers. And the next thing you know you\u2019ve got a grill doing Mexican food, one doing Asian food, another doing barbecue. We all ate and brought things back to put on the ice in our coolers. It was awesome.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Wingo is a social worker who lives in West Asheville, on a small block between the interstate and the Pisgah View public housing community. She proudly said, \u201cWe are a super diverse neighborhood. We are a community of Russian-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and English-speaking families,\u201d and some neighbors had a history of exceptional potlucks even before the storm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We shared what we had. Over that grill, wine and banana bread, I realized we\u2019re all going to be okay.</p> <footer> <cite>Rachel Wingo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were all checking in on each other, seeing what everyone needed,\u201d said Wingo. \u201cWe all had to clean out our freezers and refrigerators pretty quickly.\u201d They picked the vegetables from their gardens as there was a cold snap just around the corner in the forecast. \u201cWe had some tomatoes, I had some garlic, a few onions \u2026 My garden washed away in the rains, so I could only gather what was left. But that turned into our first meal.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s not a big meat eater, but had bought a food subscription box from a local farmer. She didn\u2019t really know how to cook the meat that came with the groceries. So all that beef was in her freezer and in danger of going bad.</p> <p>She walked the meat across the street to Salvadoran neighbors. \u201cAnd they made carne asada with it. They explained to me that they cooked it very dry \u2026 and it didn\u2019t have to be refrigerated. And you could still eat it for a couple of days. So I had multiple days of carne asada.\u201d</p> <p>In some neighborhoods, there were multiple days of community meals. While Aurilio\u2019s area enjoyed one big bonfire, Kellem\u2019s family attended a cookout every night for a week. For Wingo and her neighbors, it has been three weeks and counting. The power is back on, but many challenges remain and multiple sources of food have been disrupted. So they\u2019re still cooking for each other. She marveled: \u201cWe did all of this with no money. We just used whatever we already had.\u201d</p> <p>Her favorite meal of the whole affair was one evening at the home of Marty Gutierrez and her family. Gutierrez runs a home-based custom cake shop, Marty\u2019s Cakes &amp; Desserts. She served banana bread, grilled meats and veggies for tacos. Someone else fried nopales, a kind of edible cactus. The owner of a local natural wine shop called Crocodile Wines showed up with a case of wine. \u201cThat one was at the center of the neighborhood, and everyone showed up. Adults, kids, older folks, people I\u2019d never met, people who didn\u2019t speak the same languages but just showed up anyway!\u201d Wingo remembered.</p> <p>It was a moment. Generosity won. And a community bonded over the shared distress of living in a city where wrecked infrastructure means you can\u2019t drink from the tap, cook with its water or just pop out to the grocery store due to road closures or power outages.

      "bodyText": "Erin Kellem\u2019s Asheville, North Carolina neighborhood is a short drive from the city center, but feels remote. The Haw Creek area\u2019s culs-de-sac are fronted by spacious yards and surrounded by thick woods that give the illusion of isolation. Hurricane Helene changed that, dropping an ocean of rain on the southern Appalachian mountains. Floods of biblical proportions killed dozens. Power outages left thousands without electricity for at least two weeks in most places. There was no gas or cellphone service for days following the storm, and most of the city is still without potable water. Roads disappeared under rushing water and mud. The help that was on its way had no way in, and those stranded in their homes had no way of checking on loved ones. \u201cAnyone in the neighborhood with a chainsaw came out to help clear the roads,\u201d said Kellem, whose family has lived in Haw Creek for 22 years. \u201cWhen it became obvious that we weren\u2019t getting power back any time soon and our freezers were beginning to thaw, we collectively said: \u2018Well, what do we have in our freezers? And what can we all make with it?\u2019\u201d Like so many around town, Kellem and her neighbors dug through their fridges and freezers, pooled their wilting veggies and thawed meats to feed one another. \u201cOur neighbors told us they were also planning what they called a \u2018freezer burn\u2019, and told us to bring a grill or camp stove if we had one,\u201d said Taylor Aurilio, who lives near the Smith Mill Creek neighborhood, on the western side of the city. \u201cI think they were expecting maybe a dozen people, but it ended up being about 30 people. Neighbors were wheeling their grills down from their houses, bringing all the meat from their freezers. And the next thing you know you\u2019ve got a grill doing Mexican food, one doing Asian food, another doing barbecue. We all ate and brought things back to put on the ice in our coolers. It was awesome.\u201d Rachel Wingo is a social worker who lives in West Asheville, on a small block between the interstate and the Pisgah View public housing community. She proudly said, \u201cWe are a super diverse neighborhood. We are a community of Russian-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and English-speaking families,\u201d and some neighbors had a history of exceptional potlucks even before the storm. \u201cWe were all checking in on each other, seeing what everyone needed,\u201d said Wingo. \u201cWe all had to clean out our freezers and refrigerators pretty quickly.\u201d They picked the vegetables from their gardens as there was a cold snap just around the corner in the forecast. \u201cWe had some tomatoes, I had some garlic, a few onions \u2026 My garden washed away in the rains, so I could only gather what was left. But that turned into our first meal.\u201d She\u2019s not a big meat eater, but had bought a food subscription box from a local farmer. She didn\u2019t really know how to cook the meat that came with the groceries. So all that beef was in her freezer and in danger of going bad. She walked the meat across the street to Salvadoran neighbors. \u201cAnd they made carne asada with it. They explained to me that they cooked it very dry \u2026 and it didn\u2019t have to be refrigerated. And you could still eat it for a couple of days. So I had multiple days of carne asada.\u201d In some neighborhoods, there were multiple days of community meals. While Aurilio\u2019s area enjoyed one big bonfire, Kellem\u2019s family attended a cookout every night for a week. For Wingo and her neighbors, it has been three weeks and counting. The power is back on, but many challenges remain and multiple sources of food have been disrupted. So they\u2019re still cooking for each other. She marveled: \u201cWe did all of this with no money. We just used whatever we already had.\u201d Her favorite meal of the whole affair was one evening at the home of Marty Gutierrez and her family. Gutierrez runs a home-based custom cake shop, Marty\u2019s Cakes &amp; Desserts. She served banana bread, grilled meats and veggies for tacos. Someone else fried nopales, a kind of edible cactus. The owner of a local natural wine shop called Crocodile Wines showed up with a case of wine. \u201cThat one was at the center of the neighborhood, and everyone showed up. Adults, kids, older folks, people I\u2019d never met, people who didn\u2019t speak the same languages but just showed up anyway!\u201d Wingo remembered. It was a moment. Generosity won. And a community bonded over the shared distress of living in a city where wrecked infrastructure means you can\u2019t drink from the tap, cook with its water or just pop out to the grocery store due to road closures or power outages. How long the recovery will take, no one knows. \u201cNone of us are hoarding supplies. None of us are being weird about it,\u201d said Wingo. \u201cWe\u2019re all prepared for the worst. We all had pantries, but we shared what we had. Over that grill, wine and banana bread, I realized we\u2019re all going to be okay. \u201cBefore this, I probably knew the names of the dogs in our neighborhood more than I did their parents,\u201d she said with a laugh. It took a catastrophic hurricane and weeks of power and water outages to turn those neighbors into friends \u2013 at least for a short time. Wingo\u2019s Buttonwood Court is slated for demolition due to a massive interstate expansion that will gut the neighborhood like a knife.",

As more attendees arrived, organizers gave them electric tea candles and flowers to hold during the vigil, held for the estimated <a href=\"https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-22-october-2024\">42,000 </a>Palestinians who have been killed since 7 October 2023. The event, organized by UMiss for Palestine, a student activist group at the University of Mississippi, marked a striking departure from its previous solidarity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/04/university-of-mississippi-counter-protesters\">demonstration in May</a>, which drew hundreds of counter-protesters, many of who spewed racist vitriol at the students.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s event was reverent, with solemn expressions of grief and remembrance befitting a funeral. According to organizers, those who gathered did so to \u201chonor the martyrs, commit to fight for the living, and stand in solidarity with Palestinians in [their] community and in the rest of the world\u201d.</p> <p>The May event, which was held on the University of Mississippi\u2019s campus, saw student organizers calling for the state\u2019s flagship college to disclose its endowment investments that pertain to Israel. They demanded that the school divest from military contracts and academic partnerships with Israel, and condemn the genocide in Gaza.</p> <p>At some point during the protest, the UMiss for Palestine demonstrators were surrounded by counter-protesters who jeered, threw items and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/06/university-of-mississippi-palestine-counter-protest-investigation\">made racist remarks</a> before police evacuated the pro-Palestinian students.</p> <p>One student who made monkey noises at a Black woman was expelled from Phi Delta Theta, his fraternity, which is now on an interim <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/ole-miss-fraternity-suspended-over-hazing-allegations-after-video-surfaces-report\">suspension</a> from the university following a separate incident last month.

      "bodyText": "On Sunday night, about 40 people gathered outside of city hall in Oxford, Mississippi, near the town\u2019s famed statue of William Faulkner, in front of a Palestinian flag that read \u201cFree Palestine\u201d. As more attendees arrived, organizers gave them electric tea candles and flowers to hold during the vigil, held for the estimated 42,000 Palestinians who have been killed since 7 October 2023. The event, organized by UMiss for Palestine, a student activist group at the University of Mississippi, marked a striking departure from its previous solidarity demonstration in May, which drew hundreds of counter-protesters, many of who spewed racist vitriol at the students. Sunday\u2019s event was reverent, with solemn expressions of grief and remembrance befitting a funeral. According to organizers, those who gathered did so to \u201chonor the martyrs, commit to fight for the living, and stand in solidarity with Palestinians in [their] community and in the rest of the world\u201d. The May event, which was held on the University of Mississippi\u2019s campus, saw student organizers calling for the state\u2019s flagship college to disclose its endowment investments that pertain to Israel. They demanded that the school divest from military contracts and academic partnerships with Israel, and condemn the genocide in Gaza. At some point during the protest, the UMiss for Palestine demonstrators were surrounded by counter-protesters who jeered, threw items and made racist remarks before police evacuated the pro-Palestinian students. One student who made monkey noises at a Black woman was expelled from Phi Delta Theta, his fraternity, which is now on an interim suspension from the university following a separate incident last month. The counter-protesters were widely condemned for their actions, though some, including Mississippi\u2019s governor, Tate Reeves; the Georgia representative Mike Collins; and Donald Trump celebrated their actions. Sunday\u2019s vigil, however, was monitored by at least half a dozen police officers and a legal observer, and was uninterrupted by outside parties. Dua\u2019a Matalgah, a psychology major and media liaison for UMiss for Palestine, said that they had a different goal this week. \u201cThis event was more about the community and giving space to that community for feeling and sharing our grief and honoring the lives of the martyrs,\u201d she said. Aala\u2019a, a student with UMiss for Palestine, opened the vigil with a reading of the poem A Prayer for Palestine. \u201cWe weep. We scream. We listen. We pray. We pour into the streets. We make phone calls. We boycott. We divest. Yet it does not feel like enough. As a people are being turned to rubble,\u201d she read. Matalgah followed, reading the names of 50 Palestinians who had been killed by Israeli forces since 7 October, before leading a moment of silence. Another student highlighted the interconnectedness of liberation movements, and called for those gathered to remain hopeful. \u201cWe let the people of Palestine and Lebanon know that their voices are heard, even here in our small town in Mississippi,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, we honor the martyrs who were promised to those still living. Free Lebanon, free Syria and free, free Palestine.\u201d The impending US election loomed over the demonstration, as an adult speaker who identified himself as Chuck noted that Israel\u2019s war on Gaza did not begin on 7 October. \u201cThe cause of Palestinian genocide does not fall on one US president, does not fall on one imperialist prime minister and does not fall on one sole event,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a long, complicated, historical and systemic process that necessitates an international movement to defeat the imperialist powers that propagate genocide. From South Africa to Vietnam to Ireland to Cuba, us together fight for Palestine to be freed from the river to the sea.\u201d Matalgah told the Guardian that the focus on the election obfuscated the real problem. \u201cA lot of people are scared about the results of the election, and I think because of that, they are focusing a lot on it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt angers me, though, because I don\u2019t think either candidate will create any change for Palestine.\u201d At the end of the vigil, organizers passed out stickers and zines with information about UMiss for Palestine and Mississippi for Palestine, a statewide group that has organized and participated in actions across the state, Gulf coast and mid-south. \u201cIf we don\u2019t keep fighting for Palestine, Palestine will not be the end of it,\u201d Matalgah added. \u201cThis is a matter that concerns the everyday American just as much as it does as the Palestinians.\u201d",

He was the seventh child of Eileen Capes, though the eldest of her three children by her third husband Bill Capes. After school, when he represented his county at basketball, football and cross-country, he worked as a coalman and an agricultural labourer, before following in the footsteps of his grandfather, uncle and older brothers, he joined the police, working for 10 years before representing his country at the Moscow Olympics. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2024. Geoff Capes took gold at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand, not in 1984 as an earlier version said. He won gold at the European indoor championships in Gothenburg in 1974, not 1984, and in Munich in 1976. not 1986. He also won bronze in the European championships in Rome in 1974, not 1984.",

The African Union, which also includes former French, Spanish and Portuguese colonies, has joined forces with the Caribbean Community (Caricom) to put pressure on former slave-owning European nations to engage with the reparations movement. Caricom has drawn up a <a href=\"https://caricom.org/caricom-ten-point-plan-for-reparatory-justice/\">10-point plan for reparatory justice</a>.</p> <p>In Britain in recent years, organisations including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/29/first-thing-guardian-owner-apologises-for-founders-transatlantic-slavery-links\">the Guardian</a>, the Church of England and the Bank of England have apologised for their links to slavery.

For diaspora communities, reparation should tackle health. I would like to see serious investment in care facilities for older diaspora people.\u201d</p> <h2>Talk to the people</h2> <p>Clive Baldwin, a senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch, said reparations were an acknowledgment to people affected by human rights abuses, and so had to \u201cengage with the people\u201d, rather than being confined to \u201cgovernment-to-government\u201d discussions.</p> <p>The UK recently agreed to hand over Britain\u2019s last African colony, the Chagos Islands, to Mauritius in an agreement that includes a right of return for Chagossians, whom the UK expelled from their homes in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for a US military base, with a commitment to \u201caddress wrongs of the past\u201d.</p> <p>Baldwin said how the UK enacted this promise to Chagossians, who are significantly descended from enslaved Africans, was important to the wider issue of reparations.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chagossians are one of many examples of the ongoing impact of colonialism \u2013 the trauma is something that goes through generations and affects an entire people. If they can\u2019t address that, what can they address?\u201d</p> <h2>Recognise the impact on black Britons</h2> <p>Clive Lewis MP, who hosts the Heirs of Enslavement podcast, said: \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to deal with the very cause of the structural racism in the most basic way, by an apology, then is it any more than window-dressing that you say we\u2019re going to build a fairer Britain for black people?\u201d</p> <p>Lewis said the \u201cbaseline\u201d for the UK government in addressing reparations should be the 10-point plan devised by Caricom, which has asked for a formal apology and debt cancellation.</p> <h2>Look to the EU</h2> <p>The Irish billionaire Denis O\u2019Brien believes reparations to Caribbean nations could be modelled on the EU\u2019s European regional development fund (ERDF), which has sought to reduce inequalities within Europe since 1975.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien, who founded the Repair Campaign for reparations, said the organisation was working in the Caribbean on plans modelled on the ERDF with the University of the West Indies.

But the summit communique indicated that little progress had been made on an alternative payment system. Speaking at the summit in the Russian city of Kazan, Putin said: \u201cThe dollar is being used as a weapon. We really see that this is so. I think that this is a big mistake by those who do this.\u201d He said that nearly 95% of trade between Russia and China is now conducted in rubles and yuan. The move to de-dollarize the world economy unnerves some Brics members \u2013 notably Brazil and India \u2013 that do not want their rapidly expanding club to become solely pro-Chinese and anti-western. Russia is working on creating a settlement and payment infrastructure that would bypass the Swift payment system based in Belgium. The de-dollarization initiative is probably the most concrete proposal likely to emerge from the summit that has been remarkable for giving Putin his biggest international platform since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The summit has been attended by the nine Brics members including the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Chinese premier and the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa.

The future purpose and size of the Brics summit \u2013 now in its 16th year - also proved controversial, with Putin saying it would be wrong to ignore the unprecedented interest in global south countries wishing to join the organisation, and keeping the organisation effective. Brazil in alliance with India has been trying to prevent Brics, already expanded from five to nine members at last year\u2019s Brics summit in South Africa, being reshaped simply into an anti-western alliance that acts as a cheerleader for Russia and China.

The decision by Turkey, a member of Nato, to attend has raised eyebrows. Agathe Demarais, a sanctions specialist at the European Council of Foreign Relations, said: \u201cAt this stage it is hard to imagine a widespread development and adoption of Brics financial tools globally. The US dollar\u2019s domination of the global currency landscape is entrenched, both for trade transactions and foreign exchange reserves; more than 80% of global trade transactions are invoiced in US dollars, which also accounts for nearly 60% of central banks reserves.",

But such cooperation is certainly not unknown on the right of politics.</p> <p>\u201cThere were lots of Tories over helping the John McCain presidential campaign,\u201d recalled the Labour staffer of the 2008 election. In 2015, a team organised by the US Young Republicans International Committee, a movement for those aged 18-40, helped out in the marginal seat of Enfield North, and the constituency of Aylesbury, where the Conservatives were being challenged by the UK Independence party.</p> <p>Then there are those who cross party lines. Simon Burns, a Conservative MP between 1987 and 2017, worked on his gap year in 1972 for George McGovern\u2019s presidential campaign against Richard Nixon. He went on to help secure the elections to the Senate and Congress of Ted and Joe Kennedy, respectively, and he campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>John Healey, the British defence secretary, suggested the Trump campaign had created a synthetic row. \u201cThis is in the middle of an election campaign, that\u2019s the way that politics works,\u201d he said. </p> <p>But this is not the first time this issue has blown up. In 2018, the Bernie Sanders campaign agreed to pay a $14,500 fine (\u00a311,190) to the FEC after the agency ruled that his 2016 presidential campaign had accepted an illegal contribution from the Australian Labor party.</p> <p>The FEC found against Sanders on the basis that the Australian volunteers had received a stipend from the Labor party and had their flights paid for. There is no suggestion that anything like that happened in this case \u2013 but the row continues.</p> <p>\u201cThe flailing Harris-Walz campaign is seeking foreign influence to boost its radical message \u2013 because they know they can\u2019t win the American people,\u201d said Susie Wiles, co-manager of the Trump-Vance campaign. \u201cPresident Trump will return strength to the White House and put America, and our people, first.\u201d</p>",

The moment of maximum cooperation was perhaps during the era of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, when the \u201cthird way\u201d in western politics was in the ascendancy and mutually supportive thinktanks made the connections. But such cooperation is certainly not unknown on the right of politics. \u201cThere were lots of Tories over helping the John McCain presidential campaign,\u201d recalled the Labour staffer of the 2008 election. In 2015, a team organised by the US Young Republicans International Committee, a movement for those aged 18-40, helped out in the marginal seat of Enfield North, and the constituency of Aylesbury, where the Conservatives were being challenged by the UK Independence party. Then there are those who cross party lines. Simon Burns, a Conservative MP between 1987 and 2017, worked on his gap year in 1972 for George McGovern\u2019s presidential campaign against Richard Nixon. He went on to help secure the elections to the Senate and Congress of Ted and Joe Kennedy, respectively, and he campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016. John Healey, the British defence secretary, suggested the Trump campaign had created a synthetic row. \u201cThis is in the middle of an election campaign, that\u2019s the way that politics works,\u201d he said. But this is not the first time this issue has blown up. In 2018, the Bernie Sanders campaign agreed to pay a $14,500 fine (\u00a311,190) to the FEC after the agency ruled that his 2016 presidential campaign had accepted an illegal contribution from the Australian Labor party. The FEC found against Sanders on the basis that the Australian volunteers had received a stipend from the Labor party and had their flights paid for. There is no suggestion that anything like that happened in this case \u2013 but the row continues. \u201cThe flailing Harris-Walz campaign is seeking foreign influence to boost its radical message \u2013 because they know they can\u2019t win the American people,\u201d said Susie Wiles, co-manager of the Trump-Vance campaign. \u201cPresident Trump will return strength to the White House and put America, and our people, first.\u201d",

The term has gained traction on social media but is not a formal medical diagnosis, and therefore still unfamiliar to many doctors.</p> <h2>What is breast implant illness?</h2> <p>BII refers to autoimmune dysfunction characterized by \u201cchronic, low level inflammation that somehow is caused by breast implants\u201d, says Dr Brian Buinewicz, a plastic surgeon working in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Buinewicz co-authored a 2021 <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34513545/\">study</a> on BII citing generalized pain, fatigue, brain fog, migraines, anxiety, arthritis, vision changes, rashes, gastrointestinal issues and depression among the most common symptoms mentioned by a cohort of 248 participants.</p> <p>The highest risk of inflammation seemed posed by textured silicone implants, but the study found people with all types of implant could experience symptoms of BII and find relief upon removal.</p> <p>Autoimmune dysfunction affects many of the body\u2019s organ systems, which is why such a diverse range of symptoms can result, Buinewicz says.</p> <h2>Why are breast implants making some people sick?</h2> <p>We don\u2019t know for sure why breast implants may cause health issues. There are several theories.</p> <p>Buinewicz, who performs around 25 explant \u2013 or implant removal \u2013 surgeries every month, suggests that the problems may relate to silicone, as both saline and silicone gel implants have a shell made of polysiloxane silicone rubber. Silicone is currently considered non-toxic and biologically inert, meaning it shouldn\u2019t initiate a reaction from living tissue. It is widely used in both medical and everyday applications, like cookware. Yet doctors are now wondering if it could trigger inflammation, especially in patients who have some form of pre-existing allergy or sensitivity.</p> <p>Buinewicz\u2019s 2021 study also raised the possibility that low-grade bacterial infections related to implants could be linked to BII, but further research is needed.</p> <p>Researchers in 2023 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/implants-like-pacemakers-and-insulin-pumps-often-fail-because-of-immune-attacks-stopping-them-could-make-medical-devices-safer-and-longer-lasting-211090#:~:text=Mechanics%20of%20implant%20rejection&amp;text=Immune%20cells%20activated%20by%20mechanical,reaction%2C%20the%20thicker%20the%20capsule.\">argued</a> that people who express high levels of a gene called RAC2 may be more prone to severe inflammatory responses to foreign objects in the body, like pacemakers or breast implants.</p> <p>In Facebook groups for people with BII, some fear that heavy metals such as <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/breast-implants/fda-backgrounder-platinum-silicone-breast-implants\">platinum</a>, trace amounts of which can be present in breast implants, may be provoking the toxic effects they feel; or that their bodies are simply rejecting foreign materials, the way skin pushes out a splinter.

      "body": "<p>So this is what you get from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/15/pay-deal-new-starbucks-ceo-brian-niccol\">a $113m chief executive</a>: a ditching of profits guidance served with a dollop of platitudes about going back to the company\u2019s roots. Amazingly, the stock market still thinks Starbucks is worth 25% more than before Brian Niccol was appointed.</p> <p>To be fair to the new boss, he\u2019s been in post for a month, so it\u2019s too soon to expect a fully formed strategy. He was merely offering an initial helicopter view of operations (or perhaps the perspective from his private jet on the commute from Newport Beach, California, to the Seattle head office). That inevitably involved <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Prepared-Remarks-from-Brian-Niccol.mp4\">syrupy praise for \u201cour green-apron partners\u201d</a> and a homage to the unconvincing corporate claim that a chain with 36,000 outlets in 84 countries can still style itself as \u201cthe community coffeehouse\u201d.</p> <p>Nor can investors grumble about the yanking of profits guidance. Nobody believed in predecessor Laxman Narasimhan\u2019s promises of near-term growth anyway, so it is only sensible not to try to forecast next year\u2019s outcome when you\u2019ve just reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/23/starbucks-brian-niccol-menu-coffee\">a 7% quarterly slump in like-for-like store sales and a plunge in earnings</a>.</p> <p>All the same, Niccol\u2019s brew was thin and tepid. \u201cWe will simplify our overly complex menu, fix our pricing architecture, and ensure that every customer feels Starbucks is worth it every single time they visit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The second item of that list hints at what the outside world thinks is Starbucks\u2019s core problem: its prices. When a cup of coffee, even a fancy one, can cost $6 or $7 in the core US market, is it really a mystery why punters are buying less frequently?

      "bodyText": "So this is what you get from a $113m chief executive: a ditching of profits guidance served with a dollop of platitudes about going back to the company\u2019s roots. Amazingly, the stock market still thinks Starbucks is worth 25% more than before Brian Niccol was appointed. To be fair to the new boss, he\u2019s been in post for a month, so it\u2019s too soon to expect a fully formed strategy. He was merely offering an initial helicopter view of operations (or perhaps the perspective from his private jet on the commute from Newport Beach, California, to the Seattle head office). That inevitably involved syrupy praise for \u201cour green-apron partners\u201d and a homage to the unconvincing corporate claim that a chain with 36,000 outlets in 84 countries can still style itself as \u201cthe community coffeehouse\u201d. Nor can investors grumble about the yanking of profits guidance. Nobody believed in predecessor Laxman Narasimhan\u2019s promises of near-term growth anyway, so it is only sensible not to try to forecast next year\u2019s outcome when you\u2019ve just reported a 7% quarterly slump in like-for-like store sales and a plunge in earnings. All the same, Niccol\u2019s brew was thin and tepid. \u201cWe will simplify our overly complex menu, fix our pricing architecture, and ensure that every customer feels Starbucks is worth it every single time they visit,\u201d he said. The second item of that list hints at what the outside world thinks is Starbucks\u2019s core problem: its prices. When a cup of coffee, even a fancy one, can cost $6 or $7 in the core US market, is it really a mystery why punters are buying less frequently? Transactions were down 10% in the US as prices increased 4%. Niccol may succeed in injecting a renewed focus on service standards, as he did at the burrito chain Chipotle, but one still comes back to the prices. In the world after a post-inflation shock, consumers are increasingly looking at upwardly revised versions of what they\u2019re expected to pay for non-essential \u201cpremium\u201d offerings and deciding to go without or try alternative suppliers. It\u2019s not as if the US, or the rest of the developed world, is undersupplied with independent and branded coffee shops with lower price \u201carchitecture\u201d. Niccol\u2019s answer to what a \u201cfix\u201d means for Starbucks is one enormous unknown. Another is his plan in China, where Starbucks got in early in 1999 and has expanded to thousands of outlets, but has now run into fierce price-cutting competition from the likes of the local operator Luckin, now back in expansionary mode after an accounting scandal.

Here are some of the key points of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s testimony this morning in Avignon, southern France.</p> \n<h2> On who a rapist can be, and the effect of the evidence she has heard </h2> \n<p>After asking for the trial to be open to the public, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has attended almost every day of proceedings since they began on 2 September. She said of what she had heard:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>The profile of a rapist is not someone met in a car park late at night. A rapist can also be in the family, among our friends.</em></p> \n <p><em>When I saw one of the accused on the stand last week who came into my bedroom and house without consent </em>\u2026</p> \n <p><em>This man, who came to rape an unconscious, 57-year-old woman \u2013 I am also a mother and grandmother. I could have been his grandmother.</em></p> \n <p><em>I am a woman who is totally destroyed, and don\u2019t know how I can pick myself up from this.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>On why she was taking a stand in public, and how she keeps going</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>I wanted all woman victims of rape - not just when they have been drugged, rape exists at all levels \u2013 I want those woman to say: Mrs Pelicot did it, we can do it too.</em></p> \n <p><em>When you\u2019re raped there is shame, and it\u2019s not for us to have shame \u2013 it\u2019s for them.</em></p> \n <p><em>It\u2019s true that I hear lots of women, and men, who say you\u2019re very brave. I say it\u2019s not bravery, it\u2019s will and determination to change society.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>On what she feels about her former husband </h2> \n<p>Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said she wanted to address her ex-husband, who was in the courtroom and whom she called Dominique, but that she did not want to look at him. She said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>So many times, I said to myself how lucky am I to have you at my side. For me, he was someone I trusted entirely. How can the perfect man have got to this? How could you have betrayed me to this point? How could you have brought these strangers into my bedroom \u2026 ?</em></p> \n <p><em>I wouldn\u2019t have stayed 50 years if he had behaved like a violent brute. Like all couples, we had arguments. We got through lots of challenges, illness, work, money. He wasn\u2019t a brute. He never hit me \u2026 This case for me is total incomprehension. I would never have imagined a man could do this.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>On how her ex-husband drugged her, and society\u2019s poor understanding of rape </h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>Often when there\u2019s a football match on TV, I\u2019d let him watch it alone. He brought my ice-cream to bed, where I was, my favourite flavour, raspberry. And I thought, \u2018How lucky I am, he\u2019s a love\u2019 \u2026</em></p> \n <p><em>I never felt my heart flutter, I didn\u2019t feel anything, I must have gone under very quickly. I would wake up with my pyjamas on. The mornings I must have been more tired than usual, but I walk a lot and thought it was that.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>People should learn the definition of rape, she said, after hearing the partners and mothers of some of the accused speak in their defence. The men who came to assault her were defiling an unconscious woman. She said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>For me they are rapists, they remain rapists. Rape is rape \u2026 Of course today I feel responsible for nothing. Today, above all, I\u2019m a victim \u2026 We have to progress on rape culture in society.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>On whether her ex-husband was motivated by revenge or an inferiority complex </h2> \n<p>Gis\u00e8le Pelicot once had an extramarital affair and was asked if her husband may have acted out of revenge. She replied:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>I have often thought that maybe he never recovered from the fact that I had met someone in my life. I often felt responsible. I thought: was it not maybe revenge, because he had so suffered from that affair? But it was years later, we had talked about that. He had affairs as well. The first man I knew was my husband, the second was my lover. We had talked about that as well.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>She was also asked if Dominique Pelicot, who called her \u201c<em>la bourgeoise</em>\u201d, may have felt an inferiority complex. She said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve always liked going out well-dressed, I\u2019ve always been like that in my life, at work, even today. When I go to the market, I am always well dressed. So if my way of dressing and way of being was bourgeoise \u2026 [But] I never felt an inferiority complex from him.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>On whether women have obligations to their partners</h2> \n<p>The wife of one of the men accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot told the court that because her mother had been ill she had not wanted sex with him over a long period of time. \u201cI think because I refused him all the time, as a man he had to look elsewhere,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s lawyer, St\u00e9phane Babonneau, told the court his client \u201ccould not help reacting\u201d. He said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>You thought that because you refused a sexual relationship since your mother was very ill and your mind was on other things, you had a role in what happened. For Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, it\u2019s not because you refused a sexual relationship that it led to this happening.</p> \n <p>Because there is never an obligation to have sexual relations with your husband. Do you understand that? Gis\u00e8le Pelicot says you have no responsibility whatsoever in the fact that your husband decided to do what he did.</p> \n</blockquote>",

I\u2019m not playing anything: they have a better team than results are showing. \u201cI studied them the maximum I could. We watched everything in the Premier League, Twente and Porto \u2013 there is work there. \u201cThey will succeed sooner or later. Hopefully sooner and before one day I go back to the Premier League and they become my opponents. At this moment they are just my opponents for one match.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Few people in the UK will have heard of Ze\u2019ev Hever. A far-right member of the Jewish Underground in the early 80s, he was convicted in 1984 for <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/2002-07-11/ty-article/the-zambish-factor/0000017f-deed-d856-a37f-ffedcfc80000\">attempting to place a bomb</a> under the car of a Palestinian political leader. But in the years since, he has become more sophisticated and influential. He is now the secretary general of Amana, the development company behind some of the most violent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/21/the-most-successful-land-grab-strategy-since-1967-as-settlers-push-bedouins-off-west-bank-territory\">settlements and outposts</a> in the West Bank. Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/15/david-cameron-planning-sanctions-two-israeli-ministers\">UK government announced</a> that it will impose sanctions on Amana and six other groups that support West Bank settlers \u2013 a move that many moderate Israelis such as me welcome.</p> <p>The No 1 priority of the international community should be to put pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire deal that would see the fighting end in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon and a return of the hostages. But the UK government is right to target the settlement movement in the West Bank: these entities are a serious threat to a peaceful future between Israelis and Palestinians. By imposing sanctions on violent settlers, the UK not only prevents settler violence in the short term, it sends a message that there are red lines and that the international community is losing its patience.</p> <p>For the most part, settlers who commit acts of violence are not arrested, investigated or prosecuted. In fact, members of the current Israeli government have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/02/israel-vigilante-settlers-violence-benjamin-netanyahu\">shown open support</a> for extremist Israeli settlers who commit acts of violence, either by downplaying their actions or by encouraging the illegal building of further settlements and outposts \u2013 and in the process consenting to the destruction of Palestinian property and the displacement of Palestinian communities.</p> <p>Israeli governments \u2013 past and present \u2013 have been unwilling or unable to deal with this growing problem.

      "bodyText": "Few people in the UK will have heard of Ze\u2019ev Hever. A far-right member of the Jewish Underground in the early 80s, he was convicted in 1984 for attempting to place a bomb under the car of a Palestinian political leader. But in the years since, he has become more sophisticated and influential. He is now the secretary general of Amana, the development company behind some of the most violent settlements and outposts in the West Bank. Last week, the UK government announced that it will impose sanctions on Amana and six other groups that support West Bank settlers \u2013 a move that many moderate Israelis such as me welcome. The No 1 priority of the international community should be to put pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire deal that would see the fighting end in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon and a return of the hostages. But the UK government is right to target the settlement movement in the West Bank: these entities are a serious threat to a peaceful future between Israelis and Palestinians. By imposing sanctions on violent settlers, the UK not only prevents settler violence in the short term, it sends a message that there are red lines and that the international community is losing its patience. For the most part, settlers who commit acts of violence are not arrested, investigated or prosecuted. In fact, members of the current Israeli government have shown open support for extremist Israeli settlers who commit acts of violence, either by downplaying their actions or by encouraging the illegal building of further settlements and outposts \u2013 and in the process consenting to the destruction of Palestinian property and the displacement of Palestinian communities. Israeli governments \u2013 past and present \u2013 have been unwilling or unable to deal with this growing problem. It is therefore critical that the international community gets involved by imposing sanctions on those who take part in the violence. With elections looming in the US, and the EU moving at its slow pace, the UK is well placed to shift reality on the ground. Israel\u2019s supreme court has approved Israeli banks\u2019 decisions to cut ties with entities sanctioned by either the UK or the EU \u2013 and so the recent round of sanctions will make it much harder to fund and support extremist settler activity in the West Bank. It is right for the UK to help protect innocent Israelis from missile attacks from Iran and the Houthis and at the same time impose sanctions on Israeli groups that support violent settlements. This way, Israelis who oppose their government see that their security concerns are recognised, and at the same time are encouraged to realise the wrongs and follies of the settlement project. The sanctions are consistent with what should be the long-term strategy of the international community, which is to draw a clear line between legitimate Israel and illegally occupied Palestinian territories.

      "body": "<h2><strong>THE SPITTY GROUND</strong></h2> <p>When it was reported last Friday that Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis had been landed with a five-match stadium ban for \u201cimproper behaviour\u201d around the tunnel area following their defeat to Fulham last month, Football Daily can\u2019t have been alone in wondering what exactly it was the Greek businessman could have done to merit such a hefty punishment. Considering Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and Morgan Gibbs-White had received shorter bans on the same day for slinging a few effs and jeffs at match referee Josh Smith and his team of match officials, it turns out Big Vange\u2019s suspension was imposed for the similar \u2013 but crucially very different and far more serious \u2013 crime of gobbing off in their direction.</p> <p>Let the match official take up the story. \u201cAs I walked down the tunnel at the end of the match, [Big Vange], the owner of Nottingham Forest was stood on my left-hand side at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he wrote in his match report. \u201cAs I walked past him, he spat on the floor next to my left foot. This was also seen by [assistant referee] James Mainwaring and [fourth official] Tim Robinson.\u201d He may have been working on the assumption that nobody was going to buy any argument that hocking up a loogie and expectorating near someone\u2019s feet is a traditional way of greeting around the docks of Athens, but the shipping magnate instead chose to mount a defence that was found \u201ccompletely implausible\u201d.</p> <p>He smokes cigars, his defence read. They make him cough, it read. Those coughs contain phlegm, it read. \u201cIf he has to spit, he spits in a tissue if one is available, or on the floor if he does not have one available. Sometimes when he coughs spit or phlegm can go to the floor,\u201d it read. \u201cOn the day of the incident he was suffering from a hacking cough. He was taking lozenges. As the officials approached he felt a cough coming and he coughed on the floor, down and to his right which was away from the path the officials were taking. He fails to see how coughing [where spit or phlegm can come out from any person] towards the floor in a relatively crowded tunnel is misconduct.\u201d Despite this testimony and quite apart from the fact that the tunnel in question would have been considerably less crowded if a certain someone had been enjoying the comforts of his owner\u2019s box, the independent regulatory commission also pored over what footage of the incident was available and arrived at the conclusion that Big Vange was being less than forthright.</p> <p>\u201cWe are of the view that the footage does not support the suggestion [Big Vange] coughed,\u201d it declared, having studied the City Ground equivalent of the Zapruder film. \u201cTypically, if someone was about to cough, common decency demands that one covers one\u2019s mouth. We are sure [Big Vange] would have covered his mouth if he was about to cough as someone was approaching in the opposite direction. We are sure that [Big Vange] would have covered his mouth if he was about to cough as someone was approaching in the opposite direction. Alternatively, he could have turned away. In our view the footage does not suggest he turned away at all.\u201d So far so grassy knoll, although it didn\u2019t stop the commission concluding that Big Vange \u201cdeliberately spat in a disrespectful and disgusting display of contempt towards the match officials\u201d before deciding that his serious misconduct deserved a severe punishment to act as a deterrent. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/22/nottingham-forest-owner-evangelos-marinakis-banned-spitting-officials\">A five-match stadium ban</a> for the Halls Mentho-Lyptus-sucking big man it is then; a tariff that is certainly not to be sneezed or \u2013 heaven forbid \u2013 coughed at.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Rob Smyth from 8pm BST for hot Big Cup minute-by-minute coverage of RB Leipzig 1-2 Liverpool, while Will Unwin will be clockwatching the rest of the night\u2019s action as it happens around Europe.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI think he was outstanding.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Gentlemen, you can\u2019t fight in here, this is the War Room!\u201d In fact, it is a rehearsal studio on an autumn afternoon, but let\u2019s not quibble. This is where Steve Coogan and the rest of the cast are running through a new stage version of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1964 satire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/dr-strangelove\">Dr Strangelove</a>. Watching over them is their director Sean Foley and his co-adapter, Armando Iannucci, who together resemble a tall, gruff bricklayer and his short, smiley mate.</p> <p>The actors pace around in front of an as yet unpainted wooden set, which revolves to reveal the office of General Ripper, played on screen by the peremptory Sterling Hayden and here by John Hopkins. As the scene unfolds, Ripper barks down the phone at the stiff-upper-lipped Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, played by Coogan, who is feebly clutching a computer printout in front of his face.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Coogan\u2019s character has to make a call to stop World War III \u2013 but he has run out of change for the phone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is Ripper\u2019s mental breakdown that sets in motion a cataclysmic chain of events beginning with the launching of US missiles at the Soviet Union. The rest of this abyss-black comedy follows the efforts to intercept or otherwise thwart these apparently unstoppable nukes as Armageddon looms. Columbia Pictures, thrilled at the sight of Peter Sellers donning various disguises in Kubrick\u2019s 1962 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/13/lolita-at-60-stanley-kubricks-daring-drama-is-a-deft-tightrope-act\">adaptation of Lolita</a>, stipulated that the actor should assume multiple roles in the film. He played Mandrake, the wheedling US president Merkin Muffley, and the sinister nuclear boffin Dr Strangelove. He was also lined up for a fourth role \u2013 Major Kong, the B-52 pilot eventually played by Slim Pickens, and memorably seen riding a warhead as though it were a bucking bronco \u2013 but an ankle injury put paid to that.</p> <p>Coogan, who has frequently been compared to Sellers, and narrowly missed out on playing the Pink Panther star in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/may/22/cannes2004.cannesfilmfestival\">a 2004 biopic</a> (Geoffrey Rush pipped him to the post), is going one better than his idol and taking on all four parts. Among the photographs pinned to the studio wall today is one showing him in a Stetson, riding the missile as Major Kong. \u201cSteve playing all those roles will add a bravura quality to the story,\u201d says Foley as he and Iannucci take their seats in this basement room in London that is not unlike a nuclear bunker.</p>    <p>There is the added complication that some of Coogan\u2019s characters appear together in the same scene. Muffley and Dr Strangelove, for instance, are both in the War Room simultaneously. \u201cYeah,\u201d Foley says, sucking the air through his teeth. \u201cCould you tell us how to do that?\u201d</p> <p>A minor detail. What matters is that the sensibility of the original should be intact. As the novelist Kazuo Ishiguro has written, the movie is \u201ca remarkable blend of things that shouldn\u2019t go together \u2026 Kubrick created the darkest vision you could have of nuclear war and combined it with out-and-out comedy.\u201d</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t how it started. Kubrick was adapting Peter George\u2019s suspense novel Red Alert when it struck him that the extremity of its doomsday scenario demanded to be treated irreverently. The Cuban missile crisis had only recently abated when he enlisted Terry Southern, author of the comic novel The Magic Christian (which Sellers had given to Kubrick), to tease out the funny side of the impending apocalypse.</p> <p>Selling it as a laugh riot presented another sort of challenge. Mo Rothman, the head of Columbia Pictures, told Kubrick: \u201cThe publicity department is having a hard time getting a handle on how to promote a comedy about the destruction of the planet.\u201d Some critics found the movie too strange to love. Bosley Crowther in the New York Times called it <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/01/06/17/specials/southern-strangelove.html\">\u201cmalefic and sick\u201d</a>. Says Foley now: \u201cWe can only hope.\u201d</p>    <p>Any shock value has surely diminished. \u201cI doubt the audience will be saying, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t make jokes about that!\u2019\u201d says Iannucci. \u201cHopefully the play is a reminder of the stakes involved in all this. We look on people like Trump as a sort of entertainment, whereas the decisions they make in power have global consequences. It\u2019s not just 30-second clips on TikTok.\u201d</p> <p>Both men harbour a lifelong love of Kubrick\u2019s movie. Iannucci was born two months before it opened. \u201cSo he wasn\u2019t at the premiere,\u201d Foley points out. \u201cI first saw it on video and loved it,\u201d says Iannucci, who knows a thing or two himself about the comedy of brinkmanship, having created the political sitcoms Veep and The Thick of It, and directed The Death of Stalin. </p> <p>He also co-created The Day Today, the 1990s news parody in which Chris Morris\u2019s Paxman-esque presenter escalates an innocuous item about a peace treaty into a declaration of global war. That episode is pure Dr Strangelove, as is the scene from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/17/in-the-loop-film-review-armando-iannucci\">In the Loop</a>, the cinematic spin-off of The Thick of It, in which a US general works out the viability of a potential war using a pink talking calculator.</p> <p>\u201cThe American release of In the Loop had a Dr Strangelove-type poster,\u201d Iannucci recalls. \u201cAnd the French producers of The Death of Stalin told me they thought it had a Strangelove-esque feel. I\u2019ve always admired things like Brazil or The Great Dictator: that idea of themes that are so immense that we can only respond in an absurdist way.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Gentlemen, you can\u2019t fight in here, this is the War Room!\u201d In fact, it is a rehearsal studio on an autumn afternoon, but let\u2019s not quibble. This is where Steve Coogan and the rest of the cast are running through a new stage version of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1964 satire Dr Strangelove. Watching over them is their director Sean Foley and his co-adapter, Armando Iannucci, who together resemble a tall, gruff bricklayer and his short, smiley mate. The actors pace around in front of an as yet unpainted wooden set, which revolves to reveal the office of General Ripper, played on screen by the peremptory Sterling Hayden and here by John Hopkins. As the scene unfolds, Ripper barks down the phone at the stiff-upper-lipped Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, played by Coogan, who is feebly clutching a computer printout in front of his face. It is Ripper\u2019s mental breakdown that sets in motion a cataclysmic chain of events beginning with the launching of US missiles at the Soviet Union. The rest of this abyss-black comedy follows the efforts to intercept or otherwise thwart these apparently unstoppable nukes as Armageddon looms. Columbia Pictures, thrilled at the sight of Peter Sellers donning various disguises in Kubrick\u2019s 1962 adaptation of Lolita, stipulated that the actor should assume multiple roles in the film. He played Mandrake, the wheedling US president Merkin Muffley, and the sinister nuclear boffin Dr Strangelove. He was also lined up for a fourth role \u2013 Major Kong, the B-52 pilot eventually played by Slim Pickens, and memorably seen riding a warhead as though it were a bucking bronco \u2013 but an ankle injury put paid to that. Coogan, who has frequently been compared to Sellers, and narrowly missed out on playing the Pink Panther star in a 2004 biopic (Geoffrey Rush pipped him to the post), is going one better than his idol and taking on all four parts. Among the photographs pinned to the studio wall today is one showing him in a Stetson, riding the missile as Major Kong. \u201cSteve playing all those roles will add a bravura quality to the story,\u201d says Foley as he and Iannucci take their seats in this basement room in London that is not unlike a nuclear bunker. There is the added complication that some of Coogan\u2019s characters appear together in the same scene. Muffley and Dr Strangelove, for instance, are both in the War Room simultaneously. \u201cYeah,\u201d Foley says, sucking the air through his teeth. \u201cCould you tell us how to do that?\u201d A minor detail. What matters is that the sensibility of the original should be intact. As the novelist Kazuo Ishiguro has written, the movie is \u201ca remarkable blend of things that shouldn\u2019t go together \u2026 Kubrick created the darkest vision you could have of nuclear war and combined it with out-and-out comedy.\u201d That wasn\u2019t how it started. Kubrick was adapting Peter George\u2019s suspense novel Red Alert when it struck him that the extremity of its doomsday scenario demanded to be treated irreverently. The Cuban missile crisis had only recently abated when he enlisted Terry Southern, author of the comic novel The Magic Christian (which Sellers had given to Kubrick), to tease out the funny side of the impending apocalypse. Selling it as a laugh riot presented another sort of challenge. Mo Rothman, the head of Columbia Pictures, told Kubrick: \u201cThe publicity department is having a hard time getting a handle on how to promote a comedy about the destruction of the planet.\u201d Some critics found the movie too strange to love. Bosley Crowther in the New York Times called it \u201cmalefic and sick\u201d. Says Foley now: \u201cWe can only hope.\u201d Any shock value has surely diminished. \u201cI doubt the audience will be saying, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t make jokes about that!\u2019\u201d says Iannucci. \u201cHopefully the play is a reminder of the stakes involved in all this. We look on people like Trump as a sort of entertainment, whereas the decisions they make in power have global consequences. It\u2019s not just 30-second clips on TikTok.\u201d Both men harbour a lifelong love of Kubrick\u2019s movie. Iannucci was born two months before it opened. \u201cSo he wasn\u2019t at the premiere,\u201d Foley points out. \u201cI first saw it on video and loved it,\u201d says Iannucci, who knows a thing or two himself about the comedy of brinkmanship, having created the political sitcoms Veep and The Thick of It, and directed The Death of Stalin. He also co-created The Day Today, the 1990s news parody in which Chris Morris\u2019s Paxman-esque presenter escalates an innocuous item about a peace treaty into a declaration of global war. That episode is pure Dr Strangelove, as is the scene from In the Loop, the cinematic spin-off of The Thick of It, in which a US general works out the viability of a potential war using a pink talking calculator. \u201cThe American release of In the Loop had a Dr Strangelove-type poster,\u201d Iannucci recalls. \u201cAnd the French producers of The Death of Stalin told me they thought it had a Strangelove-esque feel. I\u2019ve always admired things like Brazil or The Great Dictator: that idea of themes that are so immense that we can only respond in an absurdist way. Take the scene in Dr Strangelove where Mandrake needs to call the president to stop World War III but he has run out of change. That\u2019s a great comedy situation.\u201d Foley believes Dr Strangelove to be Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in taking something that\u2019s brilliant and doing it in another medium,\u201d he explains. \u201cThough it can be a poisoned chalice because people might say you\u2019ve ruined it.\u201d So far, so good: Foley\u2019s stage versions of The Ladykillers (in 2011) and Withnail and I (with which he ended his tenure earlier this year as artistic director of Birmingham Rep) were both greeted warmly. \u201cIdeally, people will leave not quite knowing which bits were new and which were from the film,\u201d says Iannucci. \u201cWhen the Kubrick estate was looking over the script, there were lines where they had to go back and check whether they were in the film or not. That\u2019s a good sign.\u201d Some elements were crying out to be overhauled. \u201cThe film is a satire on maleness and power as well as politics and the arms race,\u201d says Foley. \u201cThere\u2019s only one real female character, though: a bikini-clad secretary who\u2019s having an affair with one of the generals.\u201d Iannucci winces: \u201cDifferent times,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think there was any way of staging that today,\u201d Foley continues, \u201cbut then that would make it a show with only men in it.\u201d A solution arose in the unlikely form of Vera Lynn, whose rendition of We\u2019ll Meet Again provides the film with its bitterly ironic punchline, and who now appears as a character, played by Penny Ashmore. \u201cShe gets dropped on Russia,\u201d jokes Iannucci. As if anyone needed reminding that the real world is scarcely more stable than the one depicted on stage, the US election will take place early in the run, and is sure to provide an extra frisson. \u201cThe worse the world gets, the better it is for the play,\u201d Foley says. Even without that, there is the spectre of Elon Musk, who, in his propensity for making the planet a more volatile place, could easily have stepped out of the world of Dr Strangelove. \u201cYou can have fun at Musk\u2019s expense,\u201d says Iannucci. \u201cBut I find it menacing that people in charge of information are prioritising rumours and lies that conform to their point of view.\u201d In recent months, he has been needling Musk whenever possible for the benefit of his almost 700,000 followers on X. \u201cCall it Twitter!\u201d he says, thumping a fist on the table in mock fury. He denies he is mounting any kind of sustained campaign of irritation against the platform\u2019s owner. \u201cI\u2019m just sitting down of an evening, seeing him on there and going, \u2018Ah, fuck it.\u2019\u201d On the day we meet, Taylor Swift has just come out in support of Kamala Harris, signing her endorsement statement: \u201cChildless cat lady.\u201d Musk responded by tweeting: \u201cFine Taylor \u2026 you win \u2026 I will give you a child \u2026\u201d Iannucci shakes his head in dismay. \u201cYou just go, \u2018What?

If the economy evolves broadly in line with our latest forecast, we expect to reduce the policy rate further.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Stephen Brown</strong>, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The weak economic backdrop means there is a strong case for the Bank of Canada to follow its larger 50bp cut today, which took the policy rate to 3.75%, with another 50bp move at the next meeting in December.</p> <p>it seems unlikely to us that the 50bp cut today will be a one-off. The Bank seemed to leave the door open to another larger move.</p> <p>With little sign that economic growth is accelerating fast enough to close the output gap, and assuming further encouraging CPI [consumer price inflation] data releases, we continue to expect another 50 basis point cut from the Bank in December. That would take the policy rate to 3.25% by year-end, the top end of the Bank\u2019s 2.25% to 3.25% neutral range estimate, after which we would expect the Bank to revert to 25bp cuts until the policy rate reaches 2.25% in mid-2025 - although the risks to that terminal rate forecast now seem to lie to the downside. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6718fc698f08454700fcc890\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-23T13:42:50.445Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boeing CEO promises \u2018fundamental\u2019 culture shift amid strike and cash crunch</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Boeing</strong>\u2019s chief executive, <strong>Kelly Ortberg</strong>, has laid out a turnaround plan, including a push for a \u201cfundamental culture change\u201d, as the struggling planemaker grapples with a crippling strike, mounting debt and heightened cash burn.</p> <p>The company plunged to a $6.2bn loss between July and September, as revenues fell by 1% to $17.8bn.

Analysts had pencilled in a 1.7% decline.</p> <p>Reckitt took a \u00a3100m hit to sales of its <strong>Mead Johnson</strong> baby formula powder after a tornado damaged a key warehouse in the US in July.</p> <p>Reckitt shares rose by about 3%, making it one of the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 index. The stock fell sharply earlier this year as investors worried about an internal investigation into its Middle Eastern business and litigation over its premature baby nutrition formula Enfamil made by its US-based Mead Johnson division. The company is considering whether to sell the business.</p> <p>Licht\u2019s remarks on China contrast with other companies such as <strong>L\u2019Or\u00e9al</strong>, which yesterday blamed worsening demand in China for weaker-than-expected quarterly sales. And <strong>Procter &amp; Gamble</strong>, the world\u2019s biggest consumer goods company, was downgraded by some analysts in recent months due to its exposure to China.</p> <p>China\u2019s economy has struggled to recover since the Covid-19 pandemic, and grew at the slowest rate since early last year between July and September.</p> <p>Licht said Reckitt, whose Dettol disinfectant is popular in China, regularly launches products in the country on an initially exclusive basis, before launching them elsewhere, and the company has invested in China in recent years. He told Reuters:</p> <p>Our business in China is thriving, and we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in that business year on year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re feeling very optimistic, actually, about our business in China.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Adam Vettese</strong>, market analyst at eToro, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some investors may have been fearing the worst this morning as Reckitt issued their latest trading statement. The firm is beset with legal issues in relation to its baby formula product and a multi-million dollar verdict hanging over them. Instead, there was a sigh of relief as the company, whose brands include Nurofen, Dettol and Durex, reported better-than-expected like-for-like sales than analysts expected. The health division did a lot of the heavy lifting.</p> <p>Shares have climbed 20% since plunging to decade lows off the back of the legal issues, which is great for any opportunists that got in at that level and somewhat of a relief for longer-term investors, although they are not out of the woods yet. The firm says it is on track to meet its full year guidance which I\u2019m sure shareholders are happy to hear.

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group has decided not to make a further bid for the British luxury handbag maker Mulberry, following the rejection of its previous offers, expressing concern for what it called the brand\u2019s \u201cclear lack of a commercial plan\u201d. Frasers, which already owns 37% of the company, had made a series of offers for the luxury fashion brand, all of which have been rebuffed. Mulberry\u2019s largest shareholder, Challice, a group controlled by the Singaporean entrepreneur Christina Ong and her husband, had previously said it had no interest in selling its shares. Challice has a 56% stake, meaning that is able to block any deal. The final offer from Frasers on 22 October, of 150p a share, was rejected by Mulberry\u2019s board as being \u201cuntenable\u201d. The dollar has rallied, rising by 0.3% to 104.44 against a basket of major currencies. Against sterling, it firmed by 0.3% to $1.2945. The US economy has been boosted by strong economic data and investors betting that Donald Trump can clinch next month\u2019s presidential election. Gold prices hit a new all-time high amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Spot gold hit $2,752 an ounce but is now trading 0.8% lower at $2,727 an ounce. Oil prices fell more than 2% earlier and Brent crude, the global benchmark, is now down by 0.7%, or $0.54 a barrel, at $75.51 a barrel, after industry figures pointed to a rise in US inventories. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care! \u2013 JK The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates by half a percentage point to 3.75%, and economists are expecting another cut of the same magnitude at the next meeting in December. It said in a statement: With inflation now back around the 2% target, Governing Council decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points to support economic growth and keep inflation close to the middle of the 1% to 3% range. If the economy evolves broadly in line with our latest forecast, we expect to reduce the policy rate further. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: The weak economic backdrop means there is a strong case for the Bank of Canada to follow its larger 50bp cut today, which took the policy rate to 3.75%, with another 50bp move at the next meeting in December. it seems unlikely to us that the 50bp cut today will be a one-off. The Bank seemed to leave the door open to another larger move. With little sign that economic growth is accelerating fast enough to close the output gap, and assuming further encouraging CPI [consumer price inflation] data releases, we continue to expect another 50 basis point cut from the Bank in December. That would take the policy rate to 3.25% by year-end, the top end of the Bank\u2019s 2.25% to 3.25% neutral range estimate, after which we would expect the Bank to revert to 25bp cuts until the policy rate reaches 2.25% in mid-2025 - although the risks to that terminal rate forecast now seem to lie to the downside. Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, has laid out a turnaround plan, including a push for a \u201cfundamental culture change\u201d, as the struggling planemaker grapples with a crippling strike, mounting debt and heightened cash burn. The company plunged to a $6.2bn loss between July and September, as revenues fell by 1% to $17.8bn. It reported a work backlog of $511bn, including more than 5,400 commercial planes. Ortberg stressed the need for improving performance in its defence business and its 737 Max and 777 programmes while broadly stabilising Boeing, which is \u201cat a crossroads\u201d after lapses in its performance disappointed customers and eroded trust. Ortberg told the planemaker\u2019s employees in a message containing prepared remarks for his first earnings call as CEO: This is a big ship that will take some time to turn, but when it does, it has the capacity to be great again. Ortberg\u2019s call to arms follows sweeping plans for significant downsizing announced earlier this month as a strike by about 33,000 workers that has dragged on for more than a month hit production of models including its bestselling 737 Max jet. The former Rockwell Collins executive, who took the helm of the US planemaker in August, said he was hopeful that a new contract proposal being voted on Wednesday by more of the striking workers would be approved, though analysts say ratification is not certain. It is a crucial day for the planemaker, which was already struggling with the fallout from a regulator-imposed cap on production of Max aircraft after a harrowing midair door panel blowout. Unilever is relocating its ice-cream business from Rotterdam to the heart of Amsterdam\u2019s city centre, as it gears up for a potential sale or stock market flotation of the business. About 450 employees are expected to move into the new office in the touristy flower market area in Reguliersdwarsstraat early next year, Bloomberg News reported, citing a spokesperson. Along with the rest of Unilever\u2019s nutrition business, the division is currently based in Rotterdam. In July, Unilever said it was \u201con track\u201d to demerge its ice-cream business, which includes Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, Cornetto and Wall\u2019s, by the end of next year. It wants to focus on faster growing products like beauty that don\u2019t require freezing. That kicked off a battle over whether the ice cream business, which reported revenue of \u20ac7.9bn last year, will be listed in Amsterdam or in London, where Unilever is headquartered. The company has entered initial discussions with buyout firms interested in buying the ice-cream business, valued at about \u00a315bn, Bloomberg reported previously. Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group, the owner of Sports Direct and other retail brands, has walked away from plans to mount a takeover of the British handbag maker Mulberry. The moves a day after Mulberry rejected an increased \u00a3111m bid from Frasers Group, describing it as \u201cuntenable\u201d. Frasers owns 37% of Mulberry but has faced firm opposition from the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, Challice, a group controlled by the Singaporean entrepreneur Christina Ong and her husband. Challlice has a 56% stake and can block any deal. Frasers, which owns the House of Fraser department stores, Evans Cycles and the Flannels luxury streetwear chain, said in a statement today: Frasers has become increasingly concerned over the governance of Mulberry, the apparent lack of a commercial plan against a backdrop of increasing market headwinds, and critically, the financial position in which Mulberry currently finds itself\u2026 Frasers also remains concerned about the governance of Mulberry, and in particular, would not like to see another scenario where the board chooses to exclusively engage with Challice in private on significant matters, such as the emergency subscription of \u00a310m announced on 27 September. Frasers said that it \u201cremains a long-term supporter of the well-loved British brand\u201d and expressed hope that Mulberry will now appoint a Frasers representative to the board. Mulberry shares have fallen by 8.5% today, valuing the company at \u00a374m. A new Alzheimer\u2019s drug has been rejected for widespread use by the NHS in England after the health spending watchdog said that it \u201cdoes not currently demonstrate value for the NHS\u201d. The news comes as the UK\u2019s medicines regulator said donanemab could be licensed for use in the UK. It is the second disease-modifying Alzheimer\u2019s drug to be rejected by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) in a matter of months. Donanemab, manufactured by US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, is a targeted antibody drug that slows down the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s. The drug, and another new drug for Alzheimer\u2019s called lecanemab, sold as Leqembi, developed by Japan\u2019s Eisai and the US firm Biogen, have been billed as a huge step forward in research because they target a known cause of the disease, rather than just treating the symptoms. Some senior HSBC staff should brace for job cuts after the bank\u2019s latest restructuring, the bank\u2019s new chief executive Georges Elhedery told staff in a memo seen by Reuters. After announcing one of the bank\u2019s biggest shake-ups in recent years, he wrote in the memo to staff: Inevitably some of our colleagues will face redundancies as we streamline duplicative senior roles. The leadership team will spend more time with you in the coming days to explain these changes in more detail and to give you the opportunity to ask questions. Yesterday, the London-headquartered bank, which focuses on Asia, said it would merge some operations and split its geographic footprint into east and west, in an effort save money, partly by stripping out overlapping management roles. HSBC is splitting its operations into four main businesses: UK, Hong Kong, corporate and institutional banking, and wealth banking. Those changes should \u201cboost accountability for each of the businesses, identifying underperforming areas more clearly,\u201d Morningstar analyst Michael Makdad said. The reorganisation follows a similar one by Barclays earlier this year, which split its business into five units in a move that chief executive C.S. Venkatakrishnan said would help to make clearer how each was performing. Oil prices are tumbling after industry data showed US crude inventories rose more than expected, Brent crude futures dropped by $1.50 a barrel, to $74.54 a barrel while US crude fell by $1.50 to $70.24 a barrel, both down by around 2%. US crude stocks rose by 1.64m barrels last week, Reuters reported citing market sources and figures from the American Petroleum Institute. Oil prices are still up by 2% this week, though, amid worries about the continuing conflict in the Middle East. Taylor Swift fans and Olympic visitors pushed record-breaking numbers of passengers to travel through Heathrow between June and September, leading the airport to raise the possibility of reinstating its dividend for the first time in four years. The airport said it saw consecutive weeks with record passenger numbers during the summer, with a total of 30.7 million travellers passing through from June to September. This brought the total number of passengers for the first nine months of the year to 63.1 million. Heathrow said it saw a late summer spike in departures thanks to Olympic travellers enjoying European city breaks following the Paris games, as well as music stars playing in London, where Bruce Springsteen, Kylie Minogue and Shania Twain all took to the stage. The airport experienced the busiest day for departures in its history on 24 July, followed by its busiest-ever arrivals day on 2 September. As a result, Heathrow has increased its 2024 passenger forecast to 83.8m, up from the 82.4m it forecast in April. The airport also raised the prospect of restarting its dividend this year. It said in a statement to the stock market that no dividends are currently forecast for 2024, but are \u201cprobable subject to financial performance\u201d. It comes as Heathrow made a pretax profit of \u00a3696m in the first nine months of the year, compared with \u00a3618m during the same period a year earlier. More than three quarters of Britain\u2019s financial sector bosses plan another push to get workers to spend more time in the office over the next 12 months, according to a survey of 150 industry leaders by KPMG UK. The findings, shared with Reuters, also showed more than a third of those bosses will expect employees to be in the office at least four days a week. Many employers have struggled to lure their workforces back to the office since the pandemic, when lockdowns forced millions to work from home. An earlier study by KPMG in July 2023 found just 10% of financial services staff wanted to work in the office full time. But the reluctance to return to pre-pandemic working patterns has led to a sharp drop in occupancy rates at many expensive city centre headquarters and junior staff are finding it tougher to work from home than older workers, some bosses argue. Some are also worried about the regulatory and risk pressures posed by hybrid working, though 58% of those polled said flexible working could help their firms be more competitive. Amazon has decreed a five-days-a-week office-working policy, and one of its top executives told staff this month they should look for a job elsewhere if they did not like the policy, echoing similar sentiments expressed by executives at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. According to the latest KPMG survey, bosses intend to monitor office attendance in various ways, with 45% planning to track staff using swipe systems and just under a third saying they would install digital cameras. Karim Haji, global and UK head of financial services at KPMG, said: There is no one-size fits all approach to this and businesses are still trying to find the hybrid working sweet spot more than two years on from the pandemic. Leaders see the commercial value of hybrid working models, particularly when it comes to attracting and retaining talent, but they are still expecting greater office attendance in the coming months to retain collaboration with colleagues and clients. Volvo Cars has said it expects sales growth to stall through to the end of the year as demand drops across the global car industry. The Swedish carmaker said it will experience \u201cminimal volume growth during the fourth quarter\u201d, and cut its forecasts for sales across the whole year. It said it expects sales growth of 7% and 8%, down from an earlier forecast of 12% to 15%. Car companies around the world are battening down the hatches as sales slow, amid higher interest rates and slowing economies in some key markets. The slowdown has also prompted several companies to slow their transition to battery electric vehicles, because manufacturers for now make less money on the cleaner technology compared to petrol and diesel. Volvo last month delayed its plan to sell only battery electric cars by 2030, opting instead to continue to sell hybrids. The carmaker, which is owned by China\u2019s Geely Group, said today that \u201cweakness in the market has recently accelerated\u201d across the entire car market. That has also dragged down demand for premium cars, such as its \u00a396,000 EX90 electric SUV. Volvo said that \u201cthe car market in the company\u2019s main regions of Europe, China and the US is increasingly under pressure which affects demand\u201d. Jim Rowan, Volvo\u2019s Scottish chief executive, said: Our industry is facing an increasingly volatile environment. Macroeconomic headwinds are intensifying, as is geopolitical complexity. The company expects premium sales to increase by only 1% this year. The premium segment had previously been more resilient than the market for cheaper cars. Volvo will also have to contend with tariffs on Chinese imports to Europe, the US and Canada, which will affect its ability to export from Chinese factories. Here\u2019s our full story on the UK\u2019s competition watchdog\u2019s decision to launch a formal investigation into the \u00a33.3bn takeover of the UK soft drinks maker Britvic by the Danish brewer Carlsberg. Reckitt Benckiser boss Kris Licht said the consumer goods company\u2019s business in China is \u201cthriving\u201d with double-digit sales growth there while rivals struggle. The company, whose products include the stomach pill Gaviscon and Durex condoms, posted a 0.5% drop in like-for-like sales in the third quarter, but this was not as bad as feared. Analysts had pencilled in a 1.7% decline. Reckitt took a \u00a3100m hit to sales of its Mead Johnson baby formula powder after a tornado damaged a key warehouse in the US in July. Reckitt shares rose by about 3%, making it one of the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 index. The stock fell sharply earlier this year as investors worried about an internal investigation into its Middle Eastern business and litigation over its premature baby nutrition formula Enfamil made by its US-based Mead Johnson division. The company is considering whether to sell the business. Licht\u2019s remarks on China contrast with other companies such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al, which yesterday blamed worsening demand in China for weaker-than-expected quarterly sales. And Procter &amp; Gamble, the world\u2019s biggest consumer goods company, was downgraded by some analysts in recent months due to its exposure to China. China\u2019s economy has struggled to recover since the Covid-19 pandemic, and grew at the slowest rate since early last year between July and September. Licht said Reckitt, whose Dettol disinfectant is popular in China, regularly launches products in the country on an initially exclusive basis, before launching them elsewhere, and the company has invested in China in recent years. He told Reuters: Our business in China is thriving, and we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in that business year on year. We\u2019re feeling very optimistic, actually, about our business in China. Adam Vettese, market analyst at eToro, said: Some investors may have been fearing the worst this morning as Reckitt issued their latest trading statement. The firm is beset with legal issues in relation to its baby formula product and a multi-million dollar verdict hanging over them. Instead, there was a sigh of relief as the company, whose brands include Nurofen, Dettol and Durex, reported better-than-expected like-for-like sales than analysts expected. The health division did a lot of the heavy lifting. Shares have climbed 20% since plunging to decade lows off the back of the legal issues, which is great for any opportunists that got in at that level and somewhat of a relief for longer-term investors, although they are not out of the woods yet. The firm says it is on track to meet its full year guidance which I\u2019m sure shareholders are happy to hear. It is the legal woes however that they really want to see the end of. McDonald\u2019s shares have dropped 6% in pre-market trade, after news of an E coli outbreak that resulted in at least one death was linked to the fast food chain\u2019s \u201cQuarter Pounder\u201d hamburgers, according to US public health authorities. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Tuesday that there have been 49 cases in this outbreak which spans 10 states. Ten people have been hospitalized in this onset of cases. The CDC said: This is a fast-moving outbreak investigation. Most sick people are reporting eating Quarter Pounder hamburgers from McDonald\u2019s and investigators are working quickly to confirm which food ingredient is contaminated. The agency noted that \u201cMcDonald\u2019s has pulled ingredients for these burgers\u201d and they won\u2019t be available for purchase in some states. Most of the people who have fallen ill are in Colorado and Nebraska, officials said. Let\u2019s get back to the rallying dollar, and the \u201cTrump trade\u201d which has lifted the US currency against a basket of rivals \u2013 along with stronger economic data that led markets to scale back expectations of interest rate cuts. The dollar index rose by 0.2% to 104.36, the highest since early August. Against the pound, the dollar ticked up to $1.2984 this morning. In bond markets, yields (or interest rates) on US government bonds known as Treasuries rose to three-month highs. Alix Stewart, fund manager at Schroders, explained on BBC radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Markets seem to be pricing in pretty much in line with the betting markets, which are now moving pretty much in Trump\u2019s direction. Actually, when you look at the polls, it is much, much closer. Looking at the wider impact of a second Trump administration, she said: If it\u2019s Trump with a clean sweep so he has both houses, then it\u2019s expected that he can enact more contentious policies, like his tariff policy, which would obviously have impacts on inflation and also the cost of borrowing longer term in the US. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the trade tariffs favoured by US presidential candidate Donald Trump could hurt global growth, as it upgraded its forecast for the UK economy. Q: So how do those policy decisions impact inflation and therefore the cost of borrowing? The tariff trade is one part of it. But people are looking back to when he was elected the last time, and what happened in terms of being quite aggressively going for growth and not being quite so bothered about the public debt limits and how much he\u2019s borrowing. And obviously that\u2019s one of the things that bond markets particularly are concerned about, particularly in terms of the cost of borrowing. Lloyds Banking Group has backed the Labour government\u2019s upcoming budget and played down the impact of potential tax hikes, which its chief executive said would likely be part of a \u201cconstructive, pro-growth agenda.\u201d The bank\u2019s support for Labour\u2019s agenda will come as a boost to the government, as it faces criticism from some employers over plans to increase workers\u2019 rights and hike employer national insurance contributions (NICs). Chief financial officer William Chalmers would not be drawn on the potential impact of specific tax proposals on Lloyds \u2013 including raising NICs, or the potential cancellation of stamp duty exemptions. However, he said he welcomed a budget package that was \u201cconsistent\u201d with government pledges to kick-start growth and investment in key areas like energy, infrastructure and housing. \u201cWhatever the tax changes might be, we believe that they will be pursued in the context of a constructive, pro-growth agenda. And it\u2019s that overall balance that we\u2019re really looking for, and indeed it\u2019s that overall balance, that pro-growth agenda, that we would seek to be a part of going forward.\u201d Lloyds has been working more closely with Labour in recent months, with the party having launched a charm offensive in the City in the run-up to July\u2019s general election. Last year, chief executive Charlie Nunn started advising Labour on its investment plans as part of its British Infrastructure Council, which relaunched last week as a government taskforce. And earlier this month, the bank was a headline sponsor of the government international investment summit, which is said to have come with a price tag of up to \u00a3250,000. The boss of the Co-op Group said the impact of mooted business tax hikes, such as employers paying national insurance on their workers\u2019 pensions, will cost the company \u201cmillions\u201d while the real living wage increase has increased its wage bill by \u00a3100m. Shirine Khoury-Haq welcomed Labour\u2019s proposed workers\u2019 rights package but, like business groups, urged the government to introduce the measures in consultation with businesses. Speaking on BBC radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said: Please give as much advance warning as possible and work with business to be able to implement this in a considered way. Asked about the impact of the rumoured rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) that the government could announce in the budget next Wednesday, she said: It\u2019s in the millions. We\u2019re still working that through, but it is a significant impact, as the real living wage increase was as well, our wage bill increased by about \u00a3100m. For me as a business leader, I have to balance wanting to pay my colleagues absolutely fairly and linking pay to inflation as it should be with how we run our business and how we make sure that we can continue to maintain the profitability that we need. Business groups have warned that the NICs rise could hit hiring and limit pay rises, but the Co-op chief executive said it would have no impact on pay rises at the company, which employs 65,000 people. Absolutely not the case. They will be getting the pay increases we have committed to paying the real living wage. The question then becomes, how we balance everything else in the business to be able to afford that. Employment rights reforms could cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year, according to the government\u2019s own analysis, which also found the changes will benefit low-paid employees the most, with some shift workers potentially earning an extra \u00a3600 a year. Khoury-Haq also called for an overhaul of the business rates system. We\u2019ve long called for reform of the business rate system, which we believe is fundamentally broken. And you only have to look at our UK high streets to see that it\u2019s an issue for us. Our business rates have increased \u00a320m over the last two years. That\u2019s 20% up to \u00a3111m per annum. So we are hoping that the budget will address that in order for us to be able to revitalise our high streets. Almost half a million workers in the UK whose employers are signed up to pay the voluntary real living wage are in line for a pay rise to at least \u00a312 an hour, taking their annual wage to \u00a33,000 a year above the government\u2019s minimum wage. The Living Wage Foundation said employers in London that are part of the scheme will pay an enhanced rate of \u00a313.15 an hour to cope with the extra costs of living in the capital. According to the charity that sets the rate, the rise was needed after research found the cost of living crisis continued to affect many of Britain\u2019s low-paid workers. It said recent polling of those earning below the real living wage found 60% had visited a food bank in the past year and 39% regularly skipped meals for financial reasons. Azerbaijan, the host of the Cop29 global climate summit, will see a large expansion of fossil gas production in the next decade, a new report has revealed. The authors said that the crucial negotiations should not be overseen by \u201cthose with a vested interest in keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels\u201d. Azerbaijan\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company, Socar, and its partners are set to raise the country\u2019s annual gas production from 37bn cubic metres (bcm) today to 49bcm by 2033. Socar also recently agreed to increase gas exports to the European Union by 17% by 2026. The Cop29 summit, starting on 11 November, comes as scientists say that continued record carbon dioxide emissions means \u201cthe future of humanity hangs in the balance\u201d. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that no new fossil fuel exploitation should take place if CO2 emissions were to fall to zero by 2050. Gaza\u2019s economy has been left in \u201cutter ruin\u201d by the year-long war between Israel and Hamas, and it would take 350 years to return to its pre-conflict levels, the United Nations has warned. In a report on the economic costs of the war prepared by its trade and development wing (Unctad), the UN said the fighting since Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis on 7 October last year had devastated the remnants of Gaza\u2019s economy and infrastructure. The report, presented to last month\u2019s UN general assembly, said economic activity across Gaza \u2013 which had been weak before the war \u2013 had ground to a halt, apart from minimum humanitarian health and food services provided under conditions of severe water, fuel and electricity shortages, and significant access constraints. The cost of cleaning up Sellafield is expected to spiral to \u00a3136bn and Europe\u2019s biggest nuclear waste dump cannot show how it offers taxpayers value for money, the public spending watchdog has said. Projects to fix buildings containing hazardous and radioactive material at the state-owned site on the Cumbrian coast are running years late and over budget. Sellafield\u2019s spending is so vast \u2013 with costs of more than \u00a32.7bn a year \u2013 that it is causing tension with the Treasury, the report from the National Audit Office (NAO) suggests. Officials from finance ministry told the NAO it was \u201cnot always clear\u201d how Sellafield made decisions, the report reveals. Criticisms of its costs and processes come as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, prepares to plug a hole of about \u00a340bn in her maiden budget. Hundreds of millions of pounds of local transport funding in England could be cut in next week\u2019s spending review despite having been agreed with regional mayors, putting bus, tube and tram improvements at risk, report my politics colleagues, Kiran Stacey, Jessica Elgot and Pippa Crerar. The mayors, most of whom are Labour, are engaged in a last-minute lobbying campaign to stop the Treasury raiding their transport budgets as Rachel Reeves looks for immediate savings. Officials say that without this moneybus subsidies, rolling out electric buses and schemes to increase walking and cycling could all be delayed or cut. One official said: The mayors have been pushing back on the idea that their sustainable budgets should be cut, not least because many of them thought the money was guaranteed until 2027. The new boss of Starbucks has pledged to shake up its \u201coverly complex menu\u201d in an effort to turn around the struggling coffee chain. Brian Niccol, who joined the company as chief executive in September, said Starbucks needed to \u201cfundamentally change\u201d its strategy in order to win back customers. The coffee chain reported falling sales, revenue and profit in the fourth quarter, amid weak demand in its US home market and in China, highlighting the challenges facing its new boss. In a video message, Niccol said he had heard from customers that the chain had \u201cdrifted from [its] core\u201d and were visiting less often. To welcome all our customers back and return to growth, we need to fundamentally change our recent strategy. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has launched a formal investigation into Carlsberg\u2019s \u00a33.3bn acquisition of the British soft drinks maker Britvic. In July, the Danish brewer Carlsberg struck a deal to take over Britvic, known for Robinsons squash and J2O, as it tries to establish a UK beverage \u201cpowerhouse\u201d. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it is assessing whether the deal will result in a substantial reduction in competition in any market in the UK for goods or services. It has set a deadline of 18 December for its phase-1 decision. \u201cThis is a normal process that was expected, and we look forward to working constructively with the CMA as it progresses,\u201d a Carlsberg spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement. The UK government is \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d Thames Water and ready to take action if necessary, according to the environment secretary, as Britain\u2019s biggest water company is battling for its survival, blighted by sewage scandals, fines and huge debts. Steve Reed told LBC Radio: We\u2019re closely monitoring the situation with Thames\u2026 the company remains viable, but if we have to take action, we are prepared to do that. The news came after it emerged that water companies in England could be banned from making a profit under plans for a complete overhaul of the system. The idea is one of the options being considered by a new commission set up by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) amid public fury over the way firms have prioritised profit over the environment. Sources at the department said they would consider forcing the sale of water companies in England to firms that would run them as not-for-profits. Unlike under nationalisation, the company would not be run by the government but by a private company, run for public benefit. The nonprofit model, which is widely used in other European countries, allows staff to be paid substantial salaries and bonuses but any profits on top of that are returned to the company. Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s biggest bank, has reported higher profits for the third quarter, after taking a smaller-than-expected financial hit from shareholder lawsuits over its Postbank division. The bank said it would resume share buybacks. Deutsche paused plans for more share buybacks in July, after booking a \u20ac1.3bn litigation charge linked to its botched acquisition of the lender Postbank more than a decade ago. The group has since settled with 80 plaintiffs, about 60% of the lawsuits, and cut provisions by \u20ac440m. However, provisions for credit losses doubled from a year earlier. The investor lawsuits going through the courts in recent years claim that the bank underpaid for Postbank. This has weighed on Deutsche\u2019s share price. Deutsche reported a profit before tax of \u20ac2.3bn between July and September, up 31% from a year earlier, boosted by the litigation provision release. Excluding this, profits rose by 6% to \u20ac1.8bn. Its investment bank beat expectations, with revenues up 11% from a year earlier, mirroring gains at US rivals like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. Deutsche\u2019s chief executive Christian Sewing said: In these three months, we made important progress in putting legacy litigation matters behind us, while also producing a record third-quarter profit in our operating business. However, revenues at the retail division, which includes Postbank, were flat, while the corporate bank posted a 3% decline in revenue, worse than expected. Lloyds shares rose by 0.7% after the results, which came in better than expected. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: Lloyds has kicked off the quarterly reporting season in unspectacular fashion, although there are signs of improving momentum as the year progresses\u2026 Overall, these results do not shoot the lights out, but they do provide a large element of comfort that Lloyds continues on its positive direction of travel towards a more streamlined and digital business, underpinned by a healthy financial position. Moves into other income streams such as credit cards and insurance could well bolster its major mortgage revenue, and the group\u2019s confirmation of its year-end targets is proof that the bank remains on track. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The dollar has rallied, boosted by strong economic data and investors betting that Donald Trump can clinch next month\u2019s presidential election, while gold prices hit a new all-time high amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The dollar is up again today, as markets shortened the odds of a second Trump administration. Strong US jobs figures earlier this month drove investors to scale back their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, also lifting the currency. The dollar index \u2013 which measures the US currency against six other major currencies \u2013 rose to 104.17, the highest since early August. Gold prices have hit a fresh record as the conflict in the Middle East along with uncertainty around US interest rates and the US election fuelled demand for safe-haven assets. Spot gold climbed to $2,752 an ounce, while silver prices also rose, by 3% to $34.78 an ounce. Over here, Lloyds Banking Group, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, predicted higher house prices as it reported third-quarter profits ahead of expectations. Chief executive Charlie Nunn credited income growth, cost discipline and strong asset quality. It made a statutory pre-tax profit of \u00a31.8bn between July and September, down from \u00a31.9bn a year ago, but above City forecasts of \u00a31.6bn. The bank has raised its forecast for UK house prices to rise by 3.1% this year, compared with an earlier prediction of 1.9%.

In The Message, Coates travels to Senegal, South Carolina and Palestine, offering reflections along the way on the African diaspora, US book bans and Israeli apartheid. The result is a work that both digs into the ways that the powerful seek to monopolize storytelling to preserve their privileges and charges writers with the duty to fight back by writing back.</p> \n<p>With the enormous success of his previous books; his many awards, including a MacArthur fellowship and a National Book award; and his celebrated career in journalism, Coates is known as perhaps the most perceptive critic of American racism and an eloquent chronicler of Black life in the United States today. The Message contains the same moral authority that we are accustomed to from him, but the vision and geography of this book are wider than his past work.</p> \n<p>At more than half the book\u2019s length, the chapter on Palestine is clearly the beating heart of The Message. In the summer of 2023, Coates spent 10 days in the West Bank and Israel, five days with the Palestinian Festival of Literature and much of the rest of the time with Breaking the Silence, a group composed of former Israeli soldiers who now oppose the occupation. He witnessed first-hand the daily humiliations Palestinians endure traveling on segregated roads or walking through checkpoints. In Hebron, an Israeli soldier stopped him on the street, repeatedly pressing Coates to state his religion, only allowing him to proceed when he told the soldier his grandparents were Christian. He saw how Israel controls the distribution of resources: \u201cIsrael had advanced beyond the Jim Crow South and segregated not just the pools and the fountains, but the water itself.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Palestine I saw bore so little likeness to the stories I read, and so much resemblance to the systems I\u2019ve known,\u201d he writes. The intensity of his critique extends almost as much to American journalism as it does to Israel\u2019s system of control.</p> \n<p>Predictably, some American critics have pounced on Coates, faulting him for not speaking with more Israelis or, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/fault-lines/why-ta-nehisi-coates-writes\">more bizarrely</a>, questioning the value of a \u201ccelebrity writer\u201d taking a moral stand on the question of Palestine. Recently, on CBS Mornings, he faced a particularly hostile interview in a segment that went viral and prompted the network to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cbs-news-dokoupil-israel-coates-interview-tone-01035b94b1a824c1589555def1a52c6b\">admonish the interviewer</a>. The fallback position of Coates\u2019s critics is that he doesn\u2019t have the foreign policy expertise to weigh in on the question of Palestine, but what they fail to see is that he has enormous expertise on identifying racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever, in my life, felt the glare of racism burn stranger and more intense than in Israel,\u201d he writes. After returning from the trip, Coates contacted the renowned Palestinian scholar Rashid Khalidi for a reading list, sought out Palestinian communities in the United States, and underwent an intense reckoning with the question: what can happen when victims become oppressors?</p> \n<p>I caught up with Coates on a recent Friday afternoon to discuss his book, its reception and more.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: I\u2019d like to ask you about that CBS Mornings <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qgWt-QcPYMo\">interview</a>, when Tony Dokoupil monopolized the segment and asked you hostile questions, and then the subsequent <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/10/paramount-cbs-news-tony-dokoupil-interview-ta-nehisi-coates-1236111891/\">fallout</a> at CBS. But I want to take the question in a slightly different direction.</p> \n<p>One of the ways that white supremacy works in the United States is by keeping Black people out of global affairs as soon as they say anything internationalist in tone and critical of the USA. <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/galleries/literature-and-film/item/17527\">Paul Robeson</a> had his passport revoked. <a href=\"https://www.blackagendareport.com/shirley_graham_du%20bois_history\">WEB Du Bois\u2019s</a> anti-colonial politics resulted in his self-imposed exile to Ghana. <a href=\"https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/-muhammad-ali-convicted-refusing-vietnam-draft\">Muhammad Ali</a> refused to be drafted during the Vietnam war and lost his title. Do you think the system feels especially threatened when Black people seek and speak the truth about the world outside the United States and this country\u2019s role in that world?</p> \n<p><strong>TNC</strong>: It\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s \u201cespecially\u201d. It\u2019s probably true. The thing that I\u2019ve thought a lot more about is the fact that you have a class of low-information journalists, certainly when it comes to Palestine and Israel, and perhaps the world. And I say that as somebody who was among them. These people are not low-information because they\u2019re bad people or even necessarily incurious people. But there is tremendous pressure not to have this conversation. And the pressure doesn\u2019t even come in threats but by turning the terrain into a minefield and then telling people that they really aren\u2019t qualified. And not only are you really not qualified; you shouldn\u2019t bother to get qualified, whatever that would mean.</p> \n<p>I think there\u2019s appropriate sensitivity around the Holocaust. I think there is appropriate sensitivity around the lethal force and weight of antisemitism in western history. But that doesn\u2019t give journalists a pass to not know [what is happening to the Palestinians]. And to the extent that I\u2019ve been bothered by this conversation, it\u2019s because it has gone into a kind of meta-conversation about CBS News, ethics, who is woke and who is not, and tough interviews. And that\u2019s bullshit.</p> \n<p>The topic is apartheid. Apartheid is the topic. And people who don\u2019t want to talk about apartheid, because it\u2019s uncomfortable, much like they did with the protests last year at colleges, try to turn this into a conversation about manners.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2024/oct/08/rashid-khalidi-palestine-israel-scholar-columbia-university-retires\">Rashid Khalidi, America\u2019s foremost scholar of Palestine, is retiring: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be a cog in the machine any more\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is amazing to me that the debate is not: \u201cTa-Nehisi said Israel is perpetrating apartheid, and that is not true and here\u2019s why.\u201d Or \u201cTa-Nehisi said Israel is not a democracy. It is a democracy and here\u2019s why.\u201d Or \u201cTa-Nehisi said half the population that Israel rules are second-class citizens or worse. That is not true. Here\u2019s why.\u201d I didn\u2019t even get challenged in that interview. And the reason why I\u2019m not challenged is that these are facts. There is a mountain of citations to back up those conclusions.</p> \n<p>People don\u2019t want to straightforwardly say: \u201cI am defending apartheid because \u2026 \u201d Or \u201cI think the apartheid is appropriate because \u2026 \u201d Or \u201cI think a dictatorship over a group of people that began, conservatively, more than 50 years ago is appropriate because \u2026 \u201d Instead, you get this conversation about manners, man.</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: Right. It becomes part of this almost enforced ignorance because we\u2019re just misdirecting it over manners instead.</p> \n<p><strong>TNC</strong>: Yeah. Instead of \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you read the <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/\">Amnesty International report</a> [finding Israel imposes a system of apartheid against all the Palestinians under its control]?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go read the <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/topic/apartheid\">B\u2019Tselem report</a> [which found the same]?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to some Palestinians?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put more Palestinians on the air?\u201d These are questions of power. Those of us who have fought this battle against white supremacy and racism, we understand, as Toni Morrison put it, that distraction is one [of racism\u2019s] greatest weapons. And this is a distraction.</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: If distraction is a weapon, silencing is another weapon. And we saw Palestinians silenced during the Democratic national convention (DNC).</p> \n<p><strong>TNC</strong>: Yes, although I would dispute that they were silenced. I actually think their voices were very well heard. Much to the chagrin of the conveners of the DNC and not through the help of the DNC. But I think they did a really good job of occupying the moral center out there and animating the moral energy. They were well covered in the media. That\u2019s not a small thing.</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: I see that, but I came back recently from a national conference of Arab Americans and there was palpable hatred toward the Democratic party for their support of genocide in Gaza. What hope do you have for a Black president being able to disrupt the colonial system that the book so eloquently describes?</p> \n<p><strong>TNC</strong>: I don\u2019t have much hope for a Harris presidency. I think more about systems. Abe Lincoln did not come into office wanting to smash slavery. Events dictated that that was what happened in politics. And not the least was the politics of Black people pushing in that direction.</p> \n<p>So when I say I don\u2019t really have hope for a Harris presidency disrupting that colonial system, it is not like I have hope for some other Democratic president doing it. I think these things are deeply, deeply entrenched.</p> \n<p>Should Kamala Harris win this year and in 2028 run again and there\u2019d be no change in the US\u2019s Israel policy at all, the calculus will be roughly something like this: \u201cI will continue to fund and support Israel\u2019s right to apartheid. I will continue to be the arms provider for that. And that is the price of maintaining a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d Or something roughly like that. That\u2019s a depressing prospect because Black people have been in that role that Palestinians would be in or are in right now. The New Deal was passed on our back, right? In order for it to happen, we had to be cut out of it.</p> \n<p>My hope for Black politics is that it wouldn\u2019t just mean someone [else] taking up the seat that we once occupied, without even questioning the seat itself. I feel the anti-apartheid cause is increasingly vibrant and that it matters in terms of political impact. I don\u2019t think it will matter less in 2028. It\u2019s not so much hope, but I do think something needs to change.</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: There\u2019s a role for writers here.</p> \n<p><strong>TNC</strong>: Yes, there very much is. Writing is part of raising consciousness. And one of the good things about [the book\u2019s reception] is that it\u2019s forced some ideas on to people or into the world of people that maybe they did not know before. That\u2019s what we do. Our job is to expand the political imagination.</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: You said you\u2019ve felt \u201clied to\u201d about Israel. How would you characterize this lie and how does this happen?</p> \n<p><strong>TNC</strong>: Part of it might be the makeup of the press corps. There are very few, if any, major media organizations where Palestinians, Palestinian Americans or maybe even Arab Americans have much power in terms of determining what the coverage looks like. Maybe this goes to your point, that there probably aren\u2019t many Black journalists, either, doing that coverage. And I think that is important because a Black person whose paychecks don\u2019t depend on it would have a hard time walking through Hebron [a West Bank city where Israeli controls on Palestinian life are particularly severe] and not seeing something that they know really well.</p> \n<p>Here you have a state created to protect one of the most persecuted classes in western history that has now gone on to persecute, as a state. I just think that\u2019s difficult. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s difficult because there\u2019s something particular about being Jewish. This is not a particularly Jewish error. You look out in the world and you can see various versions of the oppressed becoming oppressors in different circumstances. It makes you question some of the underlying logic of our lives.</p> \n<p>For instance, the idea that oppression is ennobling, that oppression begets wisdom, that there was some sort of natural alliance among oppressed peoples that just exists and doesn\u2019t have to be tended or crafted or created or articulated. You can throw all of that out the window. I start the essay with the story that Yad Vashem [Israel\u2019s Holocaust museum] tells, from the attempted destruction of a people to having their own state. Like, that is a nice bedtime story. You have to be a particular kind of motherfucker to want to disrupt that.</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: Anyone who writes on Palestine knows the risks. And by risk, we usually mean the risk of losing something. But it strikes me that this book is mostly about gaining something.</p> \n<p><strong>TNC</strong>: Yes! People think they\u2019re going to lose something by talking about Palestine. But they should think about what they lose by <em>not</em> talking about Palestine. For me it was a tremendous opportunity to understand the world. As a writer, I don\u2019t know what I would be doing by ignoring this.</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: Has it opened up new worlds to you?</p> \n<p><strong>TNC</strong>: Yes. Very much. When I think about it, this epic really began with Columbus stumbling upon these two continents and the associated islands, and the subsequent movement to wipe out large swaths of peoples, and then populate the islands with African slaves and European colonists, and Europe\u2019s subsequent movements to colonize and plunder much of the world. You can see that all right there in Palestine. You can really see ghosts of it. And in some cases, not the ghosts of it. You can see it in the present, you know?</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Moustafa Bayoumi is the co-editor, with Andrew Rubin, of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-selected-works-of-edward-said-9781526623539/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Selected Works of Edward Said: 1996-2006</a>.

      "bodyText": "Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s new book The Message could just as easily have been called Between the World and Me had that title not been taken by his own 2015 bestseller. In The Message, Coates travels to Senegal, South Carolina and Palestine, offering reflections along the way on the African diaspora, US book bans and Israeli apartheid. The result is a work that both digs into the ways that the powerful seek to monopolize storytelling to preserve their privileges and charges writers with the duty to fight back by writing back. With the enormous success of his previous books; his many awards, including a MacArthur fellowship and a National Book award; and his celebrated career in journalism, Coates is known as perhaps the most perceptive critic of American racism and an eloquent chronicler of Black life in the United States today. The Message contains the same moral authority that we are accustomed to from him, but the vision and geography of this book are wider than his past work. At more than half the book\u2019s length, the chapter on Palestine is clearly the beating heart of The Message. In the summer of 2023, Coates spent 10 days in the West Bank and Israel, five days with the Palestinian Festival of Literature and much of the rest of the time with Breaking the Silence, a group composed of former Israeli soldiers who now oppose the occupation. He witnessed first-hand the daily humiliations Palestinians endure traveling on segregated roads or walking through checkpoints. In Hebron, an Israeli soldier stopped him on the street, repeatedly pressing Coates to state his religion, only allowing him to proceed when he told the soldier his grandparents were Christian. He saw how Israel controls the distribution of resources: \u201cIsrael had advanced beyond the Jim Crow South and segregated not just the pools and the fountains, but the water itself.\u201d \u201cThe Palestine I saw bore so little likeness to the stories I read, and so much resemblance to the systems I\u2019ve known,\u201d he writes. The intensity of his critique extends almost as much to American journalism as it does to Israel\u2019s system of control. Predictably, some American critics have pounced on Coates, faulting him for not speaking with more Israelis or, more bizarrely, questioning the value of a \u201ccelebrity writer\u201d taking a moral stand on the question of Palestine. Recently, on CBS Mornings, he faced a particularly hostile interview in a segment that went viral and prompted the network to admonish the interviewer. The fallback position of Coates\u2019s critics is that he doesn\u2019t have the foreign policy expertise to weigh in on the question of Palestine, but what they fail to see is that he has enormous expertise on identifying racism. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever, in my life, felt the glare of racism burn stranger and more intense than in Israel,\u201d he writes. After returning from the trip, Coates contacted the renowned Palestinian scholar Rashid Khalidi for a reading list, sought out Palestinian communities in the United States, and underwent an intense reckoning with the question: what can happen when victims become oppressors? I caught up with Coates on a recent Friday afternoon to discuss his book, its reception and more. *** MB: I\u2019d like to ask you about that CBS Mornings interview, when Tony Dokoupil monopolized the segment and asked you hostile questions, and then the subsequent fallout at CBS. But I want to take the question in a slightly different direction. One of the ways that white supremacy works in the United States is by keeping Black people out of global affairs as soon as they say anything internationalist in tone and critical of the USA. Paul Robeson had his passport revoked. WEB Du Bois\u2019s anti-colonial politics resulted in his self-imposed exile to Ghana. Muhammad Ali refused to be drafted during the Vietnam war and lost his title. Do you think the system feels especially threatened when Black people seek and speak the truth about the world outside the United States and this country\u2019s role in that world? TNC: It\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s \u201cespecially\u201d. It\u2019s probably true. The thing that I\u2019ve thought a lot more about is the fact that you have a class of low-information journalists, certainly when it comes to Palestine and Israel, and perhaps the world. And I say that as somebody who was among them. These people are not low-information because they\u2019re bad people or even necessarily incurious people. But there is tremendous pressure not to have this conversation. And the pressure doesn\u2019t even come in threats but by turning the terrain into a minefield and then telling people that they really aren\u2019t qualified. And not only are you really not qualified; you shouldn\u2019t bother to get qualified, whatever that would mean. I think there\u2019s appropriate sensitivity around the Holocaust. I think there is appropriate sensitivity around the lethal force and weight of antisemitism in western history. But that doesn\u2019t give journalists a pass to not know [what is happening to the Palestinians]. And to the extent that I\u2019ve been bothered by this conversation, it\u2019s because it has gone into a kind of meta-conversation about CBS News, ethics, who is woke and who is not, and tough interviews. And that\u2019s bullshit. The topic is apartheid. Apartheid is the topic. And people who don\u2019t want to talk about apartheid, because it\u2019s uncomfortable, much like they did with the protests last year at colleges, try to turn this into a conversation about manners. It is amazing to me that the debate is not: \u201cTa-Nehisi said Israel is perpetrating apartheid, and that is not true and here\u2019s why.\u201d Or \u201cTa-Nehisi said Israel is not a democracy. It is a democracy and here\u2019s why.\u201d Or \u201cTa-Nehisi said half the population that Israel rules are second-class citizens or worse. That is not true. Here\u2019s why.\u201d I didn\u2019t even get challenged in that interview. And the reason why I\u2019m not challenged is that these are facts. There is a mountain of citations to back up those conclusions. People don\u2019t want to straightforwardly say: \u201cI am defending apartheid because \u2026 \u201d Or \u201cI think the apartheid is appropriate because \u2026 \u201d Or \u201cI think a dictatorship over a group of people that began, conservatively, more than 50 years ago is appropriate because \u2026 \u201d Instead, you get this conversation about manners, man. MB: Right. It becomes part of this almost enforced ignorance because we\u2019re just misdirecting it over manners instead. TNC: Yeah. Instead of \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you read the Amnesty International report [finding Israel imposes a system of apartheid against all the Palestinians under its control]?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go read the B\u2019Tselem report [which found the same]?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to some Palestinians?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put more Palestinians on the air?\u201d These are questions of power. Those of us who have fought this battle against white supremacy and racism, we understand, as Toni Morrison put it, that distraction is one [of racism\u2019s] greatest weapons.

      "body": "<p>Rose, 62, was living in a remote area of Washington, west of Seattle, when the scorching \u201cheat dome\u201d of 2021 hit the Pacific north-west. As the house Rose shared with her then 93-year-old mother grew hotter, and their two air conditioning units struggled to make any dent on the wall of heat, Rose\u2019s heart rate climbed, and she watched as all the rubber bands in the house liquefied.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/08/heat-dome-canada-pacific-northwest-animal-deaths\">heat dome</a> \u2013 which broke local records to reach highs of 120F (49C) \u2013 buckled roads, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads\">melted</a> electrical cables and caused about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/11/climate/deaths-pacific-northwest-heat-wave.html\">600</a> excess deaths, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/heat-wave-pacific-northwest-could-soon-repeat-due-climate-change-research-2021-07-07/\">research</a> showed it was \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without climate change. It\u2019s just one example of a worsening picture for US extreme weather driven by human caused global heating: including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/08/hurricane-helene-milton-global-heating-study\">more frequent hurricanes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/24/climate-crisis-driving-exponential-rise-in-most-extreme-wildfires\">wildfires</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/11/america-summer-floods-rainfall-climate-crisis\">devastating floods</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe heat dome was one of the most terrifying things that I have ever experienced,\u201d Rose said. The episode brought home to Rose that the climate crisis is not some risk on the horizon. \u201cOh no, it\u2019s here right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth of us could have died \u2026 It\u2019s very, very scary.\u201d</p> <p>As Americans respond to the reality of the climate crisis the Guardian spoke to people who are adapting their living environments. </p> <p>\u201cI had to fill the bathtub with ice water and lay in it all day to survive,\u201d Rose said, of the 2021 heat dome. She fashioned a mist-sprayer with a shower-head and electrical fan to keep cool. The next day, Rose recalls, \u201ceverything died on the beach and the stench was terrible \u2013 all the shellfish, oysters, mussels, everything was dead, and it stank for days\u201d.</p> <p>To avoid the house baking in future heatwaves, Rose acquired some 2in-thick insulation boards from a friend, and used them to weatherproof her office room as a refuge from the heat. She also bought a deep bathtub, which she fills up at the first sign of extreme heat. </p> <p>A few months back, Shannon Tucker was sprucing up the home she has owned in Denver, Colorado, since 2020. \u201cThe guy who came to clean my gutters said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve gotta clean up your side yard, because you\u2019ve got way too much debris and leaves and stuff,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201c\u2018And that\u2019s just like asking for a wildfire.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>Tucker, 40, said \u201cit was a wake-up call for sure\u201d \u2013 as she realised that \u201cthis innocent thing I had been doing, putting my leaves in a pile in my yard literally touching my house\u201d could be \u201cfuel for a potential fire\u201d. Now, she cleans the gutter at least every six months, and has installed air purifiers as well as solar panels at home.</p> <p>Like many other states \u2013 including Texas, California, Wyoming, Oregon, Montana and more \u2013 Colorado battled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/01/stone-canyon-fire-death-colorado-wildfire\">major wildfires this year</a>.

      "bodyText": "Rose, 62, was living in a remote area of Washington, west of Seattle, when the scorching \u201cheat dome\u201d of 2021 hit the Pacific north-west. As the house Rose shared with her then 93-year-old mother grew hotter, and their two air conditioning units struggled to make any dent on the wall of heat, Rose\u2019s heart rate climbed, and she watched as all the rubber bands in the house liquefied. The heat dome \u2013 which broke local records to reach highs of 120F (49C) \u2013 buckled roads, melted electrical cables and caused about 600 excess deaths, and research showed it was \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without climate change. It\u2019s just one example of a worsening picture for US extreme weather driven by human caused global heating: including more frequent hurricanes, wildfires and devastating floods. \u201cThe heat dome was one of the most terrifying things that I have ever experienced,\u201d Rose said. The episode brought home to Rose that the climate crisis is not some risk on the horizon. \u201cOh no, it\u2019s here right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth of us could have died \u2026 It\u2019s very, very scary.\u201d As Americans respond to the reality of the climate crisis the Guardian spoke to people who are adapting their living environments. \u201cI had to fill the bathtub with ice water and lay in it all day to survive,\u201d Rose said, of the 2021 heat dome. She fashioned a mist-sprayer with a shower-head and electrical fan to keep cool. The next day, Rose recalls, \u201ceverything died on the beach and the stench was terrible \u2013 all the shellfish, oysters, mussels, everything was dead, and it stank for days\u201d. To avoid the house baking in future heatwaves, Rose acquired some 2in-thick insulation boards from a friend, and used them to weatherproof her office room as a refuge from the heat. She also bought a deep bathtub, which she fills up at the first sign of extreme heat. A few months back, Shannon Tucker was sprucing up the home she has owned in Denver, Colorado, since 2020. \u201cThe guy who came to clean my gutters said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve gotta clean up your side yard, because you\u2019ve got way too much debris and leaves and stuff,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201c\u2018And that\u2019s just like asking for a wildfire.\u2019\u201d Tucker, 40, said \u201cit was a wake-up call for sure\u201d \u2013 as she realised that \u201cthis innocent thing I had been doing, putting my leaves in a pile in my yard literally touching my house\u201d could be \u201cfuel for a potential fire\u201d. Now, she cleans the gutter at least every six months, and has installed air purifiers as well as solar panels at home. Like many other states \u2013 including Texas, California, Wyoming, Oregon, Montana and more \u2013 Colorado battled major wildfires this year. Tucker, who works in tech communications, has noticed the fires getting worse \u2013 and creeping closer to Denver \u2013 in recent years, her phone pinging with increasing air quality alerts. When she moved to Denver six years ago, Tucker said: \u201cI don\u2019t remember experiencing going out for a walk and feeling suffocated by the air.\u201d What scares Tucker, though, is the prospect that individual moves alone cannot prepare for climate disaster \u2013 only collection action. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because like, I can\u2019t control what my neighbours do,\u201d she said, whether it\u2019s leaving out leaves that might act as wildfire kindling, or continuing to burn fossil fuels that contribute to making global heating worse. \u201cYou kind of feel helpless.\u201d Growing up on the Texas Gulf coast, Roxane Rolingson, now 71, was always aware of the prospect of hurricanes blowing in. \u201cYou didn\u2019t worry about it even slightly outside of hurricane season,\u201d she said.

In the past, when violent storms have rolled in, Rolingson and her husband have screwed boards of plywood over their 25 windows, an intense activity that will become increasingly burdensome with age. So in autumn 2023, Rolingson said she invested about $20,000 in protective stainless-steel screens on all the windows. \u201cNow, when a hurricane comes, we can leave it close to the last minute \u2013 and all we have to do is activate the corrugated shutters over the doors, then get in the car and drive away,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "The opposition Senate leader has flagged the possibility of new penalties for senators who engage in \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d beyond the chamber itself, after independent senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s shouted protest at a parliamentary reception for King Charles III and Queen Camilla. Simon Birmingham suggests parliamentary censure is an insufficient response to deter future protests and that new measures could be required. A civil disobedience expert, however, has raised questions as to whether such further measures were necessary or \u201cappropriate\u201d. \u201cThe Senate may need to consider more effective procedures or standing orders to reduce the risk of disorderly conduct in the future, otherwise we might find visiting leaders giving our parliament a wide berth,\u201d Birmingham told Guardian Australia. The Liberal senator pointed to two other past protests by parliamentarians against visiting foreign leaders involving then Greens senators Janet Rice, Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle. He noted the protesters in all three incidents were senators \u2013 but while each was inside Parliament House, none was in the Senate chamber itself. That put the protesting senators beyond the reach of existing punitive measures other than a censure, which carries no penalty beyond rebuke. In February this year, Rice held up a placard that read \u201cStop the human rights abuses\u201d during an address by the Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos Jr to a joint meeting of both houses of parliament. In 2003, Brown and Nettle shouted at the then US president, George W Bush, also during an address to the combined houses. Addresses by visiting leaders are held in the House of Representatives, meaning senators are there as guests. As King Charles concluded his speech at the reception in his honour in parliament\u2019s Great Hall on Monday, Thorpe, who is a Gurnai Gunditjmara and Djab-Wurrung woman, approached the stage yelling that he was \u201cnot our king\u201d and \u201cnot sovereign\u201d and demanding a treaty with Indigenous Australians. The government is understood to be considering what action could or should be taken against Thorpe in response to the protest but has not made a decision because the Senate is not sitting again for a month. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Birmingham said the Senate could not ignore Thorpe\u2019s actions. \u201cThe challenge lies in finding a response that is more a penalty than simply another opportunity for her to grandstand,\u201d he said. \u201cThis incident, together with others by former senators \u2026 create a risk that visiting leaders will wonder whether speaking in the Australian parliament has too high a potential for embarrassment.\u201d On Tuesday, Birmingham said Thorpe \u201cwould probably revel in being censured\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to think carefully about how we respond to this in ways that try to prevent such behaviour in the future.\u201d Dr Piero Moraro, a civil disobedience expert and criminal justice lecturer at Edith Cowan University, urged against increasing the existing sanctions in response to Thorpe\u2019s protest. \u201cIf the Senate thinks it is inappropriate for a senator to behave in the way she has behaved, then I suppose that a censure could be the right thing,\u201d Moraro said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t think it would be appropriate to introduce further measures.\u201d He described Thorpe\u2019s protest as \u201cquite brave\u201d. \u201cPersonally, I think she did something admirable, not something contemptible,\u201d he said. Moraro disagreed with the suggestion that more severe sanctions were required to prevent similar incidents. \u201cIn the current environment in which public protest is punished so harshly in the streets, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was an attempt at targeting dissent also within the parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a good idea.\u201d Thorpe remains unrepentant about her protest and said she had been inundated with supportive messages. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to the noise of those who have chosen to assimilate into the colonial system,\u201d she told ABC TV on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s their decision.

The New South Wales premier will meet affected residents on Thursday after announcing an inquiry and declaring a natural disaster to unlock emergency relief funding for the outback town and surrounding communities. Severe weather including a possible tornado knocked down seven transmission towers on the power line into Broken Hill last week, which left it and other towns including Wilcannia and Menindee with only intermittent electricity. On Wednesday Minns said people living in the state\u2019s far west had been let down by the previous Coalition state government\u2019s decision to privatise its electricity assets and hand control of them to Transgrid. The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal on Wednesday began its inquiry into Transgrid\u2019s compliance with its regulatory obligations. It said it was not yet clear whether the company had breached its licence conditions. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Broken Hill\u2019s mayor, Tom Kennedy, said Transgrid had failed to ensure confidence in the electricity grid. He accused the company of taking a \u201cgamble\u201d to save money by not upgrading the region\u2019s two backup gas generators. \u201cOne was broken and they knew it was broken,\u201d he told the ABC on Wednesday. \u201cThe other one obviously wasn\u2019t maintained well enough and that kicked out yesterday \u2013 that resulted in no power at all for up to 36 hours for some people.\u201d The region\u2019s only working emergency large-scale generator, which can run on gas or diesel, failed in hot weather on Monday and was not able to be switched on again until Tuesday.

Transgrid initially declined to comment when Guardian Australia asked about the concerns raised by Minns and Kennedy. However, late on Wednesday, the company disputed the claims. \u201cThe generator currently out of service in Broken Hill was operational before being taken offline for refurbishment in September 2024,\u201d a Transgrid spokesperson said. \u201cClaims that it has been out of service since November 2023 are not correct.\u201d Transgrid said crews were working \u201caround the clock\u201d to repair the storm-damaged power line and restore permanent electricity supply to the region. \u201cPower is currently being supplied to the region by a large-scale backup generator,\u201d the spokesperson said. The premier\u2019s criticism of Transgrid prompted a fierce debate in the NSW parliament about privatisation, with the opposition insisting it was up to the government to explain why the region\u2019s second backup generator had been offline. Minns will be accompanied on his Broken Hill trip by the independent Barwon MP, Roy Butler, who praised residents for supporting one another. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of really good people doing really good things,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re still in a tenuous situation because there\u2019s no guarantee the second generator will keep working.\u201d A Broken Hill steel manufacturer, Scott Campbell, said he had been \u201cblown away\u201d when other business owners and electricians banded together to service and deliver a generator to his daughter\u2019s sandwich and pastry shop to stop her from having to waste food. He said the town\u2019s second emergency generator had \u201cbeen sitting there offline, not functional\u201d since November.

More support and better information needed to be provided this time around, they said. \u201cSome members of the community are \u2026 frustrated with the idea of Australia spending millions of dollars on a royal family visit when places like Wilcannia don\u2019t have roads [or] basic infrastructure needs met and haven\u2019t ever [had them].\u201d Transgrid said on Thursday the temporary electricity supply \u201cremains complex\u201d and warned people to expect further outages. \u201cFrom time to time, outages can occur in localised parts of the region to enable the bulk of the supply to the community to continue, particularly during the evening peak,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cBoth Transgrid and Essential Energy have crews onsite to rapidly respond to issues as they occur and minimise impacts.\u201d Transgrid said it was working to install extra generators and a transformer that had arrived in Broken Hill \u2013 and would commission four additional generators on Thursday.",

Vaccines, too, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1413559111#:~:text=Vaccines%20dramatically%20reduced%20the%20incidence,%E2%80%9380%20y%20(4).\">significantly add to life expectancy</a>.</p> <p>He says these are often factors beyond an individual\u2019s control and come down to environment, government policies and wealth distribution.</p> <p>And for people privileged enough to have access to all of these things? Are there ways to add more longevity?</p> <p>The accredited dietician Dr Daisy Coyle says: \u201cThere is no specific formula for living to 110 years old, but we do know some factors that can influence longevity.\u201d</p> <p>A healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding smoking, exercising regularly, and limiting alcohol consumption are important. Managing stress, getting enough sleep, creating healthy connections and avoiding risky behaviours are important too, she says.</p> <p>\u201cAdopting these lifestyle habits can improve your chances of ageing well, but they don\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll live to over 100.\u201d</p> <p>Genetics play some role, she says: \u201cNot just in how long you live but also in your susceptibility to conditions like cancer and other diseases.\u201d</p> <p>A professor of healthy ageing at the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre, Prof Yun-Hee Jeon, has interviewed hundreds of older people living in rural and regional areas about their health and quality of life.</p> <p>She says social connection is an incredibly important factor contributing not only to longevity but to quality of life and overall wellbeing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/13/why-everything-you-think-about-living-to-100-might-be-wrong\">Why everything you think about living to 100 might be wrong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about having hundreds of social media followers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about having a couple of people actually close to where we live and having some sense of connection with them.\u201d</p> <p>Jeon says finding the perfect combination of lifestyle hacks to live longer may seem appealing but irks her.

Terrible record-keeping, it turns out. Newman tracked down 80% of people in the world claiming to be 110 years or older and found almost none of them have a birth certificate. His work is supported by a Japanese government review that found 82% of people aged over 100 in Japan were actually dead or couldn\u2019t be located. \u201cOkinawans eat spam and KFC at high rates and are last in Japan for consumption of vegetables and sweet potato, and eat 41kg of meat a year,\u201d Newman tells me. \u201cThey have the consistently worst BMI in Japan since 1975, including among the 75-plus-year-olds. This is not my data. It comes from the government of Japan, which surveys the people of Okinawa in the largest nutritional survey in the world.\u201d It turns out many of the components of diets such as the Mediterranean, Okinawan and other diets from blue zone regions have been cherrypicked and don\u2019t reflect how those people are actually living. What do experts recommend? The physician and executive director at the George Institute for Global Health Australia, Prof Bruce Neals, says when you look at many of the recommendations made in articles about the blue zone lifestyle, \u201csome of the suggestions are good for people\u201d. Eating more leafy greens and building movement into every day are important, evidence-based recommendations, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s also a bunch of stuff which is clearly just wrong,\u201d he says, such as incorporating a certain amount of wine into the diet. Alcohol, for example, isn\u2019t a part of any heart-healthy diet but is recommended by some blue zone diet advocates. \u201cBut the things that really have made people live longer are environmental factors like having a sewerage system, having fresh water that\u2019s readily available, and living in a society in which there is a reasonable degree of equity, peace and money,\u201d Neal says. Vaccines, too, significantly add to life expectancy. He says these are often factors beyond an individual\u2019s control and come down to environment, government policies and wealth distribution. And for people privileged enough to have access to all of these things? Are there ways to add more longevity? The accredited dietician Dr Daisy Coyle says: \u201cThere is no specific formula for living to 110 years old, but we do know some factors that can influence longevity.\u201d A healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding smoking, exercising regularly, and limiting alcohol consumption are important. Managing stress, getting enough sleep, creating healthy connections and avoiding risky behaviours are important too, she says. \u201cAdopting these lifestyle habits can improve your chances of ageing well, but they don\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll live to over 100.\u201d Genetics play some role, she says: \u201cNot just in how long you live but also in your susceptibility to conditions like cancer and other diseases.\u201d A professor of healthy ageing at the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre, Prof Yun-Hee Jeon, has interviewed hundreds of older people living in rural and regional areas about their health and quality of life. She says social connection is an incredibly important factor contributing not only to longevity but to quality of life and overall wellbeing. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about having hundreds of social media followers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about having a couple of people actually close to where we live and having some sense of connection with them.\u201d Jeon says finding the perfect combination of lifestyle hacks to live longer may seem appealing but irks her. She says even people who do everything \u201cright\u201d will probably still get sick once they hit a certain point. \u201cAbout 80% of people aged 75 and older experience more than one health condition, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not ageing well, that they will all die soon, or that they can\u2019t still have quality of life,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we have to do is accept that we will be exposed to health conditions in later stages of our lives, and so healthy life, to me, is about being able to adapt to those challenges and have some independence to do things you enjoy. I\u2019m more interested in a life of quality, rather than living a longer life.\u201d \u2022 Melissa Davey is Guardian Australia\u2019s medical editor.

Even 10 years after that, when the Switch was announced, it was mocked for being less powerful than the PS4 or Xbox One, which had both been out for years by that point.

But something as momentous as the leap from 2D to 3D gaming in the late 90s? It\u2019s been a long time since anything like that happened. The chief technological innovation of the last 15 years in games has been VR, and that turned out to have <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lack-killer-app-keeps-vr-113912449.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJRb3mRwrORkJmLaHKttJRb5o55MJzvy5HpxwxxfQf95xyQ1delFd8nrmJbo35o-CBnzlzR2vB2ycqYVxMs810eH7yrS1yRsJ6iuQ7QBMgYCSlBG5JXq39BuE4X9H54iD2DR3wO5Pg753OuBqSbkgL-gDbMZ7WyupnuMy0ABFttL\">niche appeal</a>.</p>    <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have been blown away by some of the stuff I\u2019ve seen on the PlayStation 5. The visual detail of games like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-walk-among-gods-in-a-mythological-epic\">God of War: Ragnar\u00f6k</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/14/horizon-forbidden-west-review-an-eccentric-adventure-with-robot-dinosaurs\">Horizon Forbidden West</a> is astounding. It\u2019s the PS5\u2019s speed and power that let Insomniac run wild on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/oct/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review-a-big-wholehearted-fantasy-full-of-conflict-and-emotion\">Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2</a>, and put those incredible dimension-shifting portals into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/jun/08/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-review-playstation-5-insomniac-games-sony\">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>. But most of this, though <em>extremely</em> neat, is also inessential. If it\u2019s coming at the cost of studios\u2019 ability to operate sustainably \u2013 and therefore at the cost of developers\u2019 livelihoods \u2013 is continually escalating visual fidelity actually worth it? Is it time to leave that fight behind?</p> <p>Nintendo already has. Indeed, its late president Satoru Iwata saw this coming way back in 2004. \u201cGames have come to a dead end,\u201d he told Japanese outlet Mainichi Interactive in 2004. \u201cCreating complicated games with advanced graphics used to be the golden principle that led to success, but it is no longer working \u2026 The situation right now is that even if the developers work a hundred times harder, they can forget about selling a hundred times more units, since it\u2019s difficult for them to even reach the status quo. It\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s no future to gaming if we continue to run on this principle that wastes time and energy.\u201d</p> <p>Xbox also appears to be thinking about throwing in the towel on the console wars. Though its executives have said that a shiny new Xbox console is in the works, Microsoft seems much more interested in getting its Game Pass subscription on to as many different devices as possible, rather than focusing on new hardware. Perhaps PlayStation will soon be the only one left in the technological arms race \u2013 and that could come at a huge cost.</p> <h2>What to play</h2>    <p>Wilmot is a smiling white cube, and he is very good at arranging things.

I am genuinely sad to see it go, as I was with gamesTM a few years ago. It seems inevitable that the day will come when we have no choice but to head to the internet for gaming news and reviews, so could you please recommend some websites to check out? With decent quality writing and sans any dismal toxic nonsense?\u201d My first ever job was as a junior staff writer on gamesTM magazine, and I have an enduring fondness for print \u2013 though media capitalism has ensured that most magazines now are shadows of their former selves, with skeleton staffs and lower page counts. (Hooray for the new wave of high-production-quality gaming periodicals!) For someone with print sensibilities, my non-overwhelming games website recommendations are: VGC, a news-focused site run and staffed by people who worked on magazines for ages; Eurogamer, a long-running British website that still makes room for long-form criticism; PC Gamer and Rock Paper Shotgun if you\u2019re a PC guy; and Polygon, for me, is the best of the US-based sites. Also, I hear the Guardian has a very good online games section \u2013 you should check it out some time. If you\u2019ve got a question for Question Block \u2013 or anything else to say about the newsletter \u2013 hit reply or email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

Defeats, be they with a good performance or not, risk knocking further shine off the side among a mainstream that doesn\u2019t carry the same level of appreciation for intricate patterns of play or barnstorming overlaps down the right by Ellie Carpenter if they\u2019re accompanied by defeat.</p> <p>As has become something almost routine for this side, the coming friendlies are about both the forest and the trees. Just like the Women\u2019s World Cup, this team doesn\u2019t have to worry about qualifying for their next major tournament, nor do they have the kind of emotional connection to this window like Germany, who will farewell Alexandra Popp.</p> <p>Yet after a calamitous group stage exit in Paris, the need for strong performances against two European outfits, helping to reassure the side isn\u2019t being left further behind, carries significance for the players. Results against Switzerland and Germany, which carry an important differentiation from performances, will go some way to soothe sentiment and the hatchet jobs that accompanied their Olympic elimination. And that\u2019s to say nothing of counting for Fifa ranking points, where the Matildas have fallen to 15th.</p>    <p>\u201cFootball is football and sometimes you do win ugly,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cBut I think for us, we want to play well. We want to play our style of play, the Australian way. And I think for us, we\u2019ve got to go out there and play, represent our country and get back to winning ways.</p> <p>\u201cThis new fresh cycle, it\u2019s starting from scratch again. But we need to get results. We want to win. We don\u2019t like losing.\u201d</p> <p>The elephant in the room of all this is, of course, the coaching situation. In stark contrast to how quickly Football Australia moved to replace Socceroos coach Graham Arnold with Tony Popovic \u2013 it took all of four days \u2013 it looks increasingly likely that Sermanni will see his third stint in charge of the Matildas (his first as interim) extended. The next women\u2019s international window is jam-packed, with the side to play a pair of games against Brazil and then two fixtures against Taiwan, and starts in late November.</p> <p>Matildas players are being consulted on who comes in next, to ensure a good fit. But in the context of international football, where the hours that a coach gets with their players are significantly reduced compared to their club counterparts, this is a significant number of contact hours to be providing an interim; especially since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/01/matildas-coach-tony-gustavsson-exit-paris-olympics-2024\">Gustavsson\u2019s exit was confirmed on 1 August</a>.</p> <p>Admittedly, if there was to be any coach you would entrust in this less-than-ideal scenario to establish building blocks for the future, it would be Sermanni. The veteran Scottish-Australian gave debuts to a large chunk of players that would go on to become a Golden Generation of Matildas and, after the Olympics, would appear just as suited to picking the side back up on to their feet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/08/mackenzie-arnold-matildas-goalkeeper-macca-my-story-so-far-interview\">\u2018I just got started\u2019: Matildas\u2019 Mackenzie Arnold seeks return to dizzying heights | Jack Snape</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given that Sermanni came into the role without knowing just how long he would be required as an interim, he hasn\u2019t rested on his laurels with the assignment. The 70-year-old said in September that it was his job to leave a stable, focused foundation for his successor, one that would enable them to hit the ground running.</p> <p>Indeed, after the crushing lows of the Paris Games, where the halo came closer than it otherwise has in recent times to slipping off Australia\u2019s favourite sporting team, there is also a necessity to get the team enjoying themselves again; poor morale is not conducive to performance in any setting. But above all it\u2019s about focusing on what raised them to this space in the first place, the core thing that brings this side joy. The football. \u201cFootball is the thing that makes this team,\u201d Sermanni said. \u201cFootball is the thing that excites people and football is the thing that determines success.\u201d</p>",

Disappointing performances risk further lowering morale among a playing group still stinging from the Paris Games. Defeats, be they with a good performance or not, risk knocking further shine off the side among a mainstream that doesn\u2019t carry the same level of appreciation for intricate patterns of play or barnstorming overlaps down the right by Ellie Carpenter if they\u2019re accompanied by defeat. As has become something almost routine for this side, the coming friendlies are about both the forest and the trees. Just like the Women\u2019s World Cup, this team doesn\u2019t have to worry about qualifying for their next major tournament, nor do they have the kind of emotional connection to this window like Germany, who will farewell Alexandra Popp. Yet after a calamitous group stage exit in Paris, the need for strong performances against two European outfits, helping to reassure the side isn\u2019t being left further behind, carries significance for the players. Results against Switzerland and Germany, which carry an important differentiation from performances, will go some way to soothe sentiment and the hatchet jobs that accompanied their Olympic elimination. And that\u2019s to say nothing of counting for Fifa ranking points, where the Matildas have fallen to 15th. \u201cFootball is football and sometimes you do win ugly,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cBut I think for us, we want to play well. We want to play our style of play, the Australian way. And I think for us, we\u2019ve got to go out there and play, represent our country and get back to winning ways. \u201cThis new fresh cycle, it\u2019s starting from scratch again. But we need to get results. We want to win. We don\u2019t like losing.\u201d The elephant in the room of all this is, of course, the coaching situation. In stark contrast to how quickly Football Australia moved to replace Socceroos coach Graham Arnold with Tony Popovic \u2013 it took all of four days \u2013 it looks increasingly likely that Sermanni will see his third stint in charge of the Matildas (his first as interim) extended. The next women\u2019s international window is jam-packed, with the side to play a pair of games against Brazil and then two fixtures against Taiwan, and starts in late November. Matildas players are being consulted on who comes in next, to ensure a good fit. But in the context of international football, where the hours that a coach gets with their players are significantly reduced compared to their club counterparts, this is a significant number of contact hours to be providing an interim; especially since Gustavsson\u2019s exit was confirmed on 1 August. Admittedly, if there was to be any coach you would entrust in this less-than-ideal scenario to establish building blocks for the future, it would be Sermanni. The veteran Scottish-Australian gave debuts to a large chunk of players that would go on to become a Golden Generation of Matildas and, after the Olympics, would appear just as suited to picking the side back up on to their feet. Given that Sermanni came into the role without knowing just how long he would be required as an interim, he hasn\u2019t rested on his laurels with the assignment. The 70-year-old said in September that it was his job to leave a stable, focused foundation for his successor, one that would enable them to hit the ground running. Indeed, after the crushing lows of the Paris Games, where the halo came closer than it otherwise has in recent times to slipping off Australia\u2019s favourite sporting team, there is also a necessity to get the team enjoying themselves again; poor morale is not conducive to performance in any setting. But above all it\u2019s about focusing on what raised them to this space in the first place, the core thing that brings this side joy. The football. \u201cFootball is the thing that makes this team,\u201d Sermanni said. \u201cFootball is the thing that excites people and football is the thing that determines success.\u201d",

Philip Clarke, then an employee of the South Australian Museum, also appeared both before the royal commission and before Von Doussa. Von Doussa found that Clarke\u2019s diaries, written during the royal commission, showed \u201cthat he was the originator of the fabrication theory \u2026 he claims to have taken a role and provided information that influenced the course of the royal commission in a way that I consider lacks professional objectivity and was inappropriate\u201d.

Also before Von Doussa was work done by Peter Sutton, who then as now was a fiercely independent and eminent anthropologist. He has been in the news for challenging the claims made in the book Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe. Sutton\u2019s work established that the royal commission had erred when it found that the Seven Sisters was not part of Ngarrindjeri mythology \u2013 this being part of the women\u2019s business. The anthropologist had at first been unwilling to take a stand on either side during the Hindmarsh Island affair.

But the lessons rightly drawn from the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair are that Aboriginal people \u2013 just like any other people \u2013 can have different knowledge and understandings of their traditions. Colonialism and the different ways in which Indigenous people adapted and responded can mean knowledge is sometimes fractured and differently held. None of that is evidence of lying.

There may also have been weed involved but that\u2019s beside the point. The point is, before the internet fully metastasised into a place for online bullying and mainlining horrifying global atrocities, it was a place for funny tweets, videos and news stories. So let\u2019s pretend for a moment that that is still the case, shall we? As a clown, I know all too well that, despite my best efforts to create something groundbreakingly hilarious, the funniest things in the world happen by accident. And they happen mainly to kids and animals. I aspire to someday be a 10th as funny as a goat on the internet. 1. This TikTok This video. It\u2019s a masterpiece of internet hilarity. I love everything about it: the initial hubris of this soda-chugging Icarus, the rapid escalation, the timing, the sound effects. It\u2019s all just *chef\u2019s kiss* perfection. What does any of this have to do with your man having a \u201cStar Wars Lego set Death Star\u201d? I have no idea. But I don\u2019t need to know. 2. Bad Place Big Bird If your sense of humour is as warped by the internet as mine is, then this dark-world Big Bird will simultaneously haunt your dreams and tickle your funny bone. I have a special affection for demented mascots and cursed characters, so I must also give a shout out to the Halifax Oyster festival mascot. Bless you, you creepy, multi-eyed labia majora. 3. Marco Rubio\u2019s drinking style There is nothing wrong with being parched. But there is everything wrong with the way the US Republican senator Marco Rubio guiltily sips water like a thirsty little fiscally conservative lab rat. I love rightwing US politicians (so much that I did an entire show about one of them). I would never vote for them but their complete self-seriousness makes them some of the most unintentionally funny people on earth. Shout out to Jeb Bush\u2019s \u201cplease clap\u201d moment. 4. Andy Matthews\u2019 masterpiece of a tweet I love this tweet so much. It\u2019s so perfectly crafted. I\u2019ve been referring to children as \u201cskin dogs\u201d long before I realised that I know its author, the very funny Andy Matthews. He\u2019s one half of the hilarious duo Alasdair and Andy, whose cerebral and zany comedy is some of my favourite. If you haven\u2019t checked out their shows MAGMA and TELEPORT! yet, you really should. 5. Knife kid What\u2019s funnier than a child with a knife? Maybe a child at a full sprint with a knife. This video is an absolute internet classic. Short, succinct, to the point (pun intended). Also, is it safe to assume, by the speed of his mother\u2019s \u201cNo!\u201d, that this maybe isn\u2019t the first time this rambunctious little skin dog has gotten his mitts on a knife? 6. An Ancient Egyptian mummy\u2019s voice This video is a masterclass in comedic subversion. I have watched it approximately 4m times and it still makes me laugh every time. I love science. 7. Curry Bird! Speaking of science: all hail the great Curry Bird. This hungry, accident-prone, turmeric-stained creature has brought me so much joy. Thinking about all those highly educated scientists and bird specialists being absolutely flummoxed by a curry-coated seagull \u2013 that is the kind of divine silliness I slurp right up, like a hungry seagull slurping from a vat of tikka masala. 8. Mortal Kombat tweet I don\u2019t know what\u2019s funnier about this tweet, the thought of a little video gaming kid trying to save face in front of his dad, or the thought of its author regularly facing off in arcades against little kids and their dads. 9.

This video of David Correos lives in my brain rent-free.

      "bodyText": "The latest unemployment rate should be met with cheers rather than gloom about it putting off a rate cut. We don\u2019t need higher unemployment to get a rate cut and both the government and the Reserve Bank should seize this opportunity to lock in historically low unemployment as the norm. I am by nature somewhat of a glass half-empty type. I mostly blame it on following sports teams which have a greater talent for disappointment than success. So it was peculiar last week that my immediate reaction to the latest unemployment figures was one of joy while the general response was gloom. In September, unemployment was a mere 4.1% while underemployment fell from 6.5% to 6.3%. This is absolutely good news. Historically good. Think of it like this: if you entered the labour force in October 1974, in your first 576 months of being in the labour force to January 2022, unemployment was below 4.2% just five times. In the 33 months since then it has been below 4.2% 32 times. If the graph does not display click here Right now a higher percent of adults are employed than ever before (records go back to 1966): If the graph does not display click here The surge in women working full-time means the share of all adults working full-time is as high as it has been since the 1990s recession: If the graph does not display click here We have had very strong migration over the past two years and yet unemployment is lower than anyone of working age has experienced, and more adults are working than ever before. That is astonishing. The underutilisation rate, which counts both unemployment and underemployment, is also lower now than it was before the pandemic: If the graph does not display click here That talk of a recession a few months ago seems distant \u2013 at least on the employment front. Is everything hunky dory? Of course not. The non-market sectors of education, healthcare and social assistance are contributing most of the increase hours worked, while employment growth in the \u201cmarket sector\u201d (ie those industries less reliant on government funding) is limp: If the graph does not display click here Partly this is an inevitable response after the unsustainable growth that occurred after the pandemic. But it also shows that raising interest rates 13 times does slow the economy. Ahh, I\u2019ve said it! Now we get to reason for the gloom \u2013 interest rates. The low unemployment rate means the likelihood of the next rate cut is further off than it was a month ago (or even just last week): If the graph does not display click here As someone fortunate enough to be paying off a mortgage, I would love a rate cut. As someone who is not a sociopath, I am not going to be sad if more people having a job means I\u2019ll have to wait a few more months before my mortgage repayments drop. The rates will inevitably come down \u2013 there is zero current prospect of them rising \u2013 and inflation is also down. Despite the Reserve Bank thinking the current level of unemployment is lower than it needs to be to stop inflation rising, inflation is falling. Importantly, (as Ross Gittins has also noted) the current level of unemployment is not like the mining-boom blip of early 2008 when the unemployment rate went below 4.2% for three months. It\u2019s been this low for nearly three years. This is not an aberration \u2013 it is the rule. And it should be the ceiling of what both governments and the Reserve Bank view as a standard level. The almost universal belief that the low unemployment level means no rate cut is actually rather weird given all this low unemployment has not brought with it any wages breakout. The most regular wage data we have is enterprise agreements lodged fortnightly with the Fair Work Commission. That data shows wage growth peaked a year ago: If the graph does not display click here But fears \u2013 real or otherwise \u2013 of inflation trump all right now. On Wednesday the IMF raised its predictions for inflation at the end of next year to 3.6% \u2013 surely another blow to a rate cut. But as Peter Hannam, who was one of the few to not lose his head, wrote, this was hardly news \u2013 the predictions just lined up with the most recent RBA estimates and are due to the energy rebate coming off. And while the IMF had increased its estimate for inflation from six months ago, the estimate for average inflation growth through the year is lower than was estimated 12 months ago: If the graph does not display click here Are we really going to sound the alarm because inflation is expected to average 3.3% next year? It really is time for people to calm down. Markets and commentators mostly responded to the low unemployment figures as proof that interest rates won\u2019t be cut because they just assume that low unemployment means stronger wages growth and higher inflation. But wages growth over the past two years has not risen at a pace that would prevent inflation being below 3%. This has not prevented those who lust for higher unemployment purely to satisfy their economic models wishing the RBA and government would do what they could to get unemployment up to 4.5%. For myself, I will continue to be happy that unemployment is low and instead worry that those with a job can get a decent wage rise and those looking for work can stop being forced to live in poverty. A rate cut? That would be nice, but much better news is that more Australians work now than ever before \u2013 and we should celebrate it. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work",

In 2020, Trump fired Vindman and his twin brother, Alexander Vindman, after they played a key role in the former president\u2019s first impeachment. The brothers, who both held senior positions on Trump\u2019s national security council, raised alarms about the then president\u2019s alleged attempt to pressure Ukraine to launch an investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

You vote for Democrats up and down the ticket.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Anderson\u2019s efforts to distance himself from Project 2025, Vindman has sought to directly tie his opponent to the most controversial elements of the manifesto. If Republicans win the White House and control of Congress, they could implement Trump\u2019s plans to politicize and relocate large numbers of federal employees. </p> <p>The US government <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47716\">employs</a> more than 2 million civilian workers, roughly 55,000 of whom live in the seventh district. Those jobs can provide steady employment that may pay better than other sectors, particularly for those with lower levels of education. According to <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/999101.htm\">data</a> compiled by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average hourly wage for a federal employee was $44.20 <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm\">compared</a> with $31.48 across all occupations.</p> <p>Experts predict that moving government jobs out of Virginia would have devastating economic consequences.

I\u2019ve seen what that looks like from the White House myself, and it\u2019s profoundly damaging to national security.\u201d</p> <p>Vindman has <a href=\"https://www.cbs19news.com/archives/know-your-ballot-7th-district-democratic-candidate-eugene-vindman/article_3ac4fc33-f44f-5afc-915f-241e0a5baf47.html\">said</a> he never envisioned himself as a politician, but his experience in the Trump administration spurred him to launch a congressional bid after the Democratic incumbent, Abigail Spanberger, chose to run for governor rather than seek re-election in the district. Vindman\u2019s willingness to speak out against Trump won him some fans among Virginia Democrats and turbocharged his fundraising operation, helping him emerge victorious from a crowded primary in June.</p> <p>David Buckley, a 66-year-old voter who attended the Vets for Vindman event in Woodbridge, said: \u201cHe\u2019s a man of character, somebody who\u2019s willing to step into the breach, so I\u2019m impressed by that.\u201d</p> <p>But Anderson, a former army green beret turned lawyer, has mocked Vindman\u2019s congressional bid as a \u201crevenge tour\u201d against Trump. Perhaps wary of capitalizing on his national profile, Vindman has not made his clash with Trump a central focus of his campaign, avoiding even mentioning the former president\u2019s name during his <a href=\"https://www.vpm.org/elections/2024-10-03/vindman-anderson-congress-va07-fredericksburg-umw-debate\">debate</a> against Anderson earlier this month.</p> <p>Anderson, like Trump, meanwhile, has pleaded ignorance of Project 2025, saying at the debate this month: \u201cI didn\u2019t know about it until my opponent continued to talk about it over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the specific proposal to overhaul the federal workforce, Anderson <a href=\"https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-10-10/federal-workers-policy-virginia-seventh-congressional-district-vindman-anderson-subramanyam\">told</a> the NPR affiliate VPM this month, \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for legislation that\u2019s going to remove jobs from our district; bottom line.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson\u2019s efforts to distance himself from some of the former president\u2019s most controversial proposals appears to have helped keep the race close, as internal polls <a href=\"https://x.com/jamesd0wns/status/1843027484889301418\">show</a> him and Vindman running neck and neck. The Cook Political Report recently <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/house-rating-changes-close-races-nj-07-and-va-07-shift-toward\">moved</a> the district from \u201clean Democrat\u201d to \u201ctoss up\u201d, a reflection of the seat\u2019s increased competitiveness without Spanberger on the ticket.</p> <p>As he has downplayed concerns about Project 2025, Anderson has tried to redirect attention toward issues where Republicans traditionally hold an advantage, namely border security and the economy. Anderson\u2019s campaign manager, Diego de la Pe\u00f1a, said in a statement, \u201cVindman would continue the failed policies of the past that gave us brutally high prices and an open border. Derrick is focused on the future of this district \u2013 his home district. That means lowering costs, closing the border, and working together to balance the budget.\u201d</p> <p>This strategy has proven successful here before. In 2021, the Republican governor Glenn Youngkin carried the district by seven points after Biden won the district by the same margin in the presidential election one year earlier, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/house-rating-changes-close-races-nj-07-and-va-07-shift-toward\">Cook Political Report</a>.</p> <p>Youngkin won in part by pitching himself as a less extreme version of Trump, noted Mark Rozell, founding dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. Anderson appears to be pursuing a similar approach.</p> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a calling card for Vindman and his campaign: to heighten awareness of Project 2025 and alert federal workers in the district of what potentially could happen should the Republicans win majorities in both houses of Congress,\u201d Rozell said.</p> <p>Vindman said he has heard from many constituents who have expressed deep concern about the potential effect on the federal workforce if Republicans win next month. Maurice Pettiford, a 63-year-old voter and 20-year veteran of the state department who hosted the Woodbridge event, predicted a policy like schedule F would limit the capabilities of federal agencies.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government is going to be effective, you need people with experience. You need people who are going to be loyal to whatever the mission is,\u201d Pettiford said. \u201cIn all my years of working, we didn\u2019t care whether [the president] was Democrat or Republican. It was about getting the job done.\u201d</p> <p>Vindman expects the race to be close, as <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/\">polls</a> suggest the House majority could be decided by just a handful of seats. In an encouraging sign for Vindman, Spanberger won her last election in 2022 by about five points, and Virginia Democrats have generally performed better when Trump was on the ballot, Rozell noted.</p> <p>\u201cQuite possibly, the national narrative is what Vindman really is counting on in this campaign, which is: don\u2019t give the Republicans the majority,\u201d Rozell said. \u201cIf Trump\u2019s elected especially, make sure the Democrats hold at least one house in Congress. Otherwise Project 2025 could end up being a real thing.\u201d</p> <p>Although Biden won Virginia by 10 points in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_may_2024\">polls</a> conducted before he withdrew from the presidential race suggested he could be in trouble there this year. Since taking over the top of the ticket, surveys have <a href=\"https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-10-07.html\">consistently</a> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aCZ9TJmY2yNRuJyc_cqoE-jL0rx7NDlE/view\">shown</a> Kamala Harris leading Trump by several points in Virginia, which could help pull Vindman across the finish line as well.</p> <p>\u201cWill there be a down-ticket benefit for Vindman in an extremely close, contested House race? Quite likely there will be,\u201d Rozell said. \u201cWill it be enough? We don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>",

Perhaps wary of capitalizing on his national profile, Vindman has not made his clash with Trump a central focus of his campaign, avoiding even mentioning the former president\u2019s name during his debate against Anderson earlier this month. Anderson, like Trump, meanwhile, has pleaded ignorance of Project 2025, saying at the debate this month: \u201cI didn\u2019t know about it until my opponent continued to talk about it over and over again.\u201d Asked about the specific proposal to overhaul the federal workforce, Anderson told the NPR affiliate VPM this month, \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for legislation that\u2019s going to remove jobs from our district; bottom line.\u201d Anderson\u2019s efforts to distance himself from some of the former president\u2019s most controversial proposals appears to have helped keep the race close, as internal polls show him and Vindman running neck and neck. The Cook Political Report recently moved the district from \u201clean Democrat\u201d to \u201ctoss up\u201d, a reflection of the seat\u2019s increased competitiveness without Spanberger on the ticket. As he has downplayed concerns about Project 2025, Anderson has tried to redirect attention toward issues where Republicans traditionally hold an advantage, namely border security and the economy. Anderson\u2019s campaign manager, Diego de la Pe\u00f1a, said in a statement, \u201cVindman would continue the failed policies of the past that gave us brutally high prices and an open border. Derrick is focused on the future of this district \u2013 his home district. That means lowering costs, closing the border, and working together to balance the budget.\u201d This strategy has proven successful here before. In 2021, the Republican governor Glenn Youngkin carried the district by seven points after Biden won the district by the same margin in the presidential election one year earlier, according to the Cook Political Report. Youngkin won in part by pitching himself as a less extreme version of Trump, noted Mark Rozell, founding dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. Anderson appears to be pursuing a similar approach. \u201cSo that\u2019s a calling card for Vindman and his campaign: to heighten awareness of Project 2025 and alert federal workers in the district of what potentially could happen should the Republicans win majorities in both houses of Congress,\u201d Rozell said. Vindman said he has heard from many constituents who have expressed deep concern about the potential effect on the federal workforce if Republicans win next month. Maurice Pettiford, a 63-year-old voter and 20-year veteran of the state department who hosted the Woodbridge event, predicted a policy like schedule F would limit the capabilities of federal agencies. \u201cIf the government is going to be effective, you need people with experience. You need people who are going to be loyal to whatever the mission is,\u201d Pettiford said. \u201cIn all my years of working, we didn\u2019t care whether [the president] was Democrat or Republican. It was about getting the job done.\u201d Vindman expects the race to be close, as polls suggest the House majority could be decided by just a handful of seats. In an encouraging sign for Vindman, Spanberger won her last election in 2022 by about five points, and Virginia Democrats have generally performed better when Trump was on the ballot, Rozell noted. \u201cQuite possibly, the national narrative is what Vindman really is counting on in this campaign, which is: don\u2019t give the Republicans the majority,\u201d Rozell said. \u201cIf Trump\u2019s elected especially, make sure the Democrats hold at least one house in Congress. Otherwise Project 2025 could end up being a real thing.\u201d Although Biden won Virginia by 10 points in 2020, polls conducted before he withdrew from the presidential race suggested he could be in trouble there this year. Since taking over the top of the ticket, surveys have consistently shown Kamala Harris leading Trump by several points in Virginia, which could help pull Vindman across the finish line as well. \u201cWill there be a down-ticket benefit for Vindman in an extremely close, contested House race? Quite likely there will be,\u201d Rozell said. \u201cWill it be enough? We don\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The dangers of a collapse of the main Atlantic Ocean circulation, known as Amoc, have been \u201cgreatly underestimated\u201d and would have devastating and irreversible impacts, according to an open letter released at the weekend by 44 experts from 15 countries. One of the signatories, Stefan Rahmstorf, an oceanographer and climatologist who heads the Earth system analysis department at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, explains here why he has recently upgraded his risk assessment of an Amoc breakdown as a result of global heating \u2013 and what that means for Britain, Europe and the wider world.</p> <h2>What is Amoc?</h2> <p>Amoc, or the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, is a system of ocean currents that brings heat into the northern Atlantic. Warm surface water from the tropics flows north and releases its heat in the subpolar Atlantic, south of Greenland and west of Britain and Ireland. Then it cools and sinks to a depth of between 2,000m to 3,000 metres before returning south as a cold current. Amoc is one of our planet\u2019s largest heat transport systems, moving the equivalent of 50 times the human energy use, and it has a particularly strong impact on the climate in Europe, affects the ocean\u2019s CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and oxygen supply, as well as rainfall patterns in the tropics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/gulf_stream_map/giv-4559aEsVrDLgyUF2/\" data-alt=\"graphic showing how Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is weakening\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/gulf_stream_map/giv-4559aEsVrDLgyUF2/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>How is Amoc different to the Gulf Stream?</h2> <p>They are connected because the northwards flow of Amoc goes via the Gulf Stream, which is a warm and swift Atlantic Ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico, then flows through the Florida straits, up the coast of the US and then across towards Europe. Amoc contributes just 20% to the Gulf Stream water flow but most of the heat transport, since Amoc\u2019s deep return flow is very cold. It works like a central heating system.</p> <h2>What is happening to Amoc?</h2> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/09/atlantic-ocean-circulation-nearing-devastating-tipping-point-study-finds\">indications</a> that Amoc has been slowing down for the last 60 or 70 years due to global heating. The most ominous sign is the cold blob over the northern Atlantic. The region is the only place in the world that has cooled in the past 20 years or so, while everywhere else on the planet has warmed \u2013 a sign of reduced heat transport into that region, exactly what climate computer models have predicted in response to Amoc slowing as a result of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <h2>Are there other indications that Amoc is weakening?</h2> <p>Yes. There is a region of excessive heating along the east coast of North America, which is predicted by climate models and oceanographic theory as a result of a slowing Amoc, which pushes the Gulf Stream closer to the shore.</p> <p>Another indicator is a reduction in the salt content of seawater. In the cold blob region, salinity is at its lowest level since measurements began 120 years ago. This is probably linked to Amoc slowing down and bringing less salty water and heat from the subtropics.</p> <h2>Why is the salt content significant?</h2> <p>When the water is less salty, it is less dense, which makes it harder to sink down. That is important because the sinking process is what drives Amoc. The fresher the water, the slower it gets.</p> <h2>What is driving the change in salinity?</h2> <p>Firstly, salinity is directly affected by global heating, which enhances the water cycle so there is more evaporation in the subtropics and more precipitation in the subpolar oceans. This leads to a freshening of the subpolar ocean. Then there are additional contributions from the melting of sea ice and the loss of continental ice from the Greenland ice sheet, which is freshwater that flows into the ocean.</p>    <p>It is an amplifying feedback: as Amoc gets weaker, the subpolar oceans gets less salty, and as the oceans gets less salty then Amoc gets weaker. At a certain point this becomes a vicious circle which continues by itself until Amoc has died, even if we stop pushing the system with further emissions.</p> <h2>When might Amoc weakening reach a point of no return?</h2> <p>The big unknown here \u2013 the billion-dollar question \u2013 is how far away this tipping point is. It is very difficult to answer because the process is non-linear and would be triggered by subtle differences in salinity, which in turn depend on amounts of rainfall and cloud cover over the ocean as well as Greenland melting rates. These are hard to model accurately in computers so there is a big uncertainty relating to when the tipping point will be reached.</p> <h2>What is the range of forecasts?</h2> <p>Until a few years ago, the general thinking in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was that the probability of crossing the tipping point this century was less than 10%. Since then, there have been a number of studies suggesting a collapse would probably be triggered this century, possibly in the next few decades. So my risk assessment has really changed. I am now very concerned that we may push Amoc over this tipping point in the next decades. If you ask me my gut feeling, I would say the risk that we cross the tipping point this century is about 50/50.</p> <h2>Is there any possibility it has already happened?</h2> <p>I wouldn\u2019t rule it out completely, because it would be very hard to tell from observations. Nothing dramatic happens at the tipping point. That just means Amoc is then doomed and it will slowly die, but that process could take 50 to 100 years. Because the Amoc is already weakening we can\u2019t be entirely sure whether we already passed a tipping point, but I would say this is most likely not the case, so it is not too late to prevent this.</p> <h2>What would be the warning signs of Amoc collapse?</h2> <p>We need to keep monitoring the flow of water in the Atlantic, which is being done with the <a href=\"https://rapid.ac.uk/\">Rapid project.</a> We should also monitor deep winter mixing in the northern Atlantic and Nordic seas. If the deep mixing starts to decline a lot, that could be an early indicator that we are approaching a tipping point. There are some signs of this, but we don\u2019t have enough data yet to be sure.</p> <h2>What would be the consequences of Amoc breakdown?</h2> <p>This has happened repeatedly in Earth\u2019s history, most recently during the last ice age, when big ice masses slid into the ocean \u2013 so-called Heinrich events \u2013 adding meltwater that diluted the salinity of the north Atlantic.

      "bodyText": "The dangers of a collapse of the main Atlantic Ocean circulation, known as Amoc, have been \u201cgreatly underestimated\u201d and would have devastating and irreversible impacts, according to an open letter released at the weekend by 44 experts from 15 countries. One of the signatories, Stefan Rahmstorf, an oceanographer and climatologist who heads the Earth system analysis department at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, explains here why he has recently upgraded his risk assessment of an Amoc breakdown as a result of global heating \u2013 and what that means for Britain, Europe and the wider world. What is Amoc? Amoc, or the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, is a system of ocean currents that brings heat into the northern Atlantic. Warm surface water from the tropics flows north and releases its heat in the subpolar Atlantic, south of Greenland and west of Britain and Ireland. Then it cools and sinks to a depth of between 2,000m to 3,000 metres before returning south as a cold current. Amoc is one of our planet\u2019s largest heat transport systems, moving the equivalent of 50 times the human energy use, and it has a particularly strong impact on the climate in Europe, affects the ocean\u2019s CO2 uptake and oxygen supply, as well as rainfall patterns in the tropics. How is Amoc different to the Gulf Stream? They are connected because the northwards flow of Amoc goes via the Gulf Stream, which is a warm and swift Atlantic Ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico, then flows through the Florida straits, up the coast of the US and then across towards Europe. Amoc contributes just 20% to the Gulf Stream water flow but most of the heat transport, since Amoc\u2019s deep return flow is very cold. It works like a central heating system. What is happening to Amoc? There are indications that Amoc has been slowing down for the last 60 or 70 years due to global heating. The most ominous sign is the cold blob over the northern Atlantic. The region is the only place in the world that has cooled in the past 20 years or so, while everywhere else on the planet has warmed \u2013 a sign of reduced heat transport into that region, exactly what climate computer models have predicted in response to Amoc slowing as a result of greenhouse gas emissions. Are there other indications that Amoc is weakening? Yes. There is a region of excessive heating along the east coast of North America, which is predicted by climate models and oceanographic theory as a result of a slowing Amoc, which pushes the Gulf Stream closer to the shore. Another indicator is a reduction in the salt content of seawater. In the cold blob region, salinity is at its lowest level since measurements began 120 years ago. This is probably linked to Amoc slowing down and bringing less salty water and heat from the subtropics. Why is the salt content significant? When the water is less salty, it is less dense, which makes it harder to sink down. That is important because the sinking process is what drives Amoc. The fresher the water, the slower it gets. What is driving the change in salinity? Firstly, salinity is directly affected by global heating, which enhances the water cycle so there is more evaporation in the subtropics and more precipitation in the subpolar oceans. This leads to a freshening of the subpolar ocean. Then there are additional contributions from the melting of sea ice and the loss of continental ice from the Greenland ice sheet, which is freshwater that flows into the ocean. It is an amplifying feedback: as Amoc gets weaker, the subpolar oceans gets less salty, and as the oceans gets less salty then Amoc gets weaker. At a certain point this becomes a vicious circle which continues by itself until Amoc has died, even if we stop pushing the system with further emissions. When might Amoc weakening reach a point of no return? The big unknown here \u2013 the billion-dollar question \u2013 is how far away this tipping point is. It is very difficult to answer because the process is non-linear and would be triggered by subtle differences in salinity, which in turn depend on amounts of rainfall and cloud cover over the ocean as well as Greenland melting rates. These are hard to model accurately in computers so there is a big uncertainty relating to when the tipping point will be reached. What is the range of forecasts? Until a few years ago, the general thinking in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was that the probability of crossing the tipping point this century was less than 10%. Since then, there have been a number of studies suggesting a collapse would probably be triggered this century, possibly in the next few decades. So my risk assessment has really changed. I am now very concerned that we may push Amoc over this tipping point in the next decades. If you ask me my gut feeling, I would say the risk that we cross the tipping point this century is about 50/50. Is there any possibility it has already happened? I wouldn\u2019t rule it out completely, because it would be very hard to tell from observations. Nothing dramatic happens at the tipping point. That just means Amoc is then doomed and it will slowly die, but that process could take 50 to 100 years. Because the Amoc is already weakening we can\u2019t be entirely sure whether we already passed a tipping point, but I would say this is most likely not the case, so it is not too late to prevent this. What would be the warning signs of Amoc collapse? We need to keep monitoring the flow of water in the Atlantic, which is being done with the Rapid project. We should also monitor deep winter mixing in the northern Atlantic and Nordic seas. If the deep mixing starts to decline a lot, that could be an early indicator that we are approaching a tipping point. There are some signs of this, but we don\u2019t have enough data yet to be sure. What would be the consequences of Amoc breakdown? This has happened repeatedly in Earth\u2019s history, most recently during the last ice age, when big ice masses slid into the ocean \u2013 so-called Heinrich events \u2013 adding meltwater that diluted the salinity of the north Atlantic. These are among the most massive upheavals of climate conditions in Earth\u2019s history. The effects include a cooling of the northern hemisphere, particularly northwestern Europe. There would also be a shift of the tropical rainfall belt to the south, which is bad because the rains will move away from the rainforests to regions that are not used to so much rainfall. So this will mean droughts in some regions and floods in others. Amoc collapse would also have a major impact on the northern Atlantic sea level, which would rise by half a metre or so, in addition to the rise caused by global heating. It would also reduce the CO2 uptake of the ocean because Amoc sinking in the northern Atlantic takes a lot of CO2 down into the deep oceans where it is safely locked away from the atmosphere. Amoc collapse would also change the nutrient supply and reduce the oxygen of the deep oceans. This would have a massive effect on marine biology and the entire ecosystem of the northern Atlantic. Many of these things are happening already, aren\u2019t they? Yes, to some extent. This is partly because Amoc is weakening and so is its counterpart in the southern hemisphere, the Antarctic bottom water formation, according to research by Australian colleagues. Could the cooling effect of Amoc collapse offset the heating caused by human emissions? I can\u2019t think of anywhere that will be better off. If it were just a case of averages, then somewhere like Germany might see a balance. But weather is not a climate average; it is seasonal and highly variable. Within the average you can get warm air from the south or cold polar air outbreaks from the north. These contrasts will be more pronounced if Scandinavia and Britain cool while Spain and Italy warm. This will drive much greater variability in the weather, which is bad for agriculture, and it will cause more storms. I would expect major extreme weather events that we have not seen in the past. The key thing about climate change is that both the ecosystem of the Earth as well as human settlements and infrastructures are highly adapted to what the climate was like in previous centuries.

The uncertainty is about when we will cross that threshold. We also have very few studies about what the combined effect of Amoc collapse and global heating would exactly look like. It is a question of risk assessment. I compare it to being told that there is a 10% chance of an airplane crashing. Would you get on that plane? I wouldn\u2019t. The disastrous consequences are unacceptable. Why haven\u2019t the IPCC made more of Amoc risks? They have not done enough risk assessment because they tend to focus on the most probable scenarios for future climate change. Some colleagues say we shouldn\u2019t talk about extreme possibilities like an Amoc collapse because it sounds alarmist and might distract people from more certain impacts of global heating, which are bad enough. But I think those extreme risks are part of the whole picture that we need to consider, to make responsible and rational decisions. How long would an Amoc collapse last and how survivable would it be? The last time, it took about 1,000 years to recover, though the past is not a direct analogue because there is also massive CO2 forcing this time \u2013 CO2 is already higher than any time in 15m years. There are physical reasons why some form of deep overturning circulation will eventually come back. One thing is for sure: humanity will not die out. But for some countries that will be in the midst of this, like Norway, and Scotland, the risks will be existential and raise the question whether people can continue to live there or whether most of them would rather move. How does the Amoc threat compare to other climate tipping points? That is hard to tell. It is a trade-off between more distant futures and things that are already happening. We have already crossed the tipping point of many coral reefs, which are now in middle of global die-off.

      "bodyText": "Taylor Swift fans and Olympic visitors helped push record-breaking numbers of passengers to travel through Heathrow between June and September, prompting the airport to consider reinstating its dividend for the first time in four years. The UK\u2019s biggest airport said there had been multiple consecutive weeks with record passenger numbers during the school holidays, with 30.7 million travellers passing through from June to September \u2013 bringing the total for the first nine months of the year to 63.1 million. Heathrow said there had been a summer increase in departures because of Olympic travellers enjoying European city breaks after the Paris Games, as well as music stars playing in London, as Swift, Bruce Springsteen, Kylie and Shania Twain all staged concerts in the capital. The airport experienced the busiest day for departures in its history on 24 July, followed by its busiest ever arrivals day on 2 September. As a result, Heathrow has increased its 2024 passenger forecast to 83.8 million, up from the 82.4 million it forecast in April. Heathrow also raised the prospect of restarting its dividend this year. It said in a statement to the stock market that no dividends were currently forecast for 2024 but it was \u201cprobable\u201d they would pay one, subject to financial performance. The news comes as Heathrow made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3696m in the first nine months of the year, compared with \u00a3618m during the same period a year earlier. The busy summer \u201ctested our colleagues, infrastructure and airlines to cooperate harder than ever before, with record numbers of passengers travelling through the busiest two runway airport in the world\u201d, said Thomas Woldbye, Heathrow\u2019s chief executive. Heathrow last paid its ultimate shareholders a \u00a3100m dividend in February 2020, just before global aviation was grounded for months by border closures and Covid lockdowns. The company initially pledged to suspend dividends until 2022, as it asked for leniency from its lenders because of the severe disruption to air travel during the pandemic. Over the past year, there have been substantial changes to Heathrow\u2019s ownership, after the infrastructure company Ferrovial looked to sell most of its stake in the airport after almost two decades as its primary owner. Ferrovial said in June it had reached a new agreement with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund and the French private equity investor Ardian, which would result in it retaining just over 5% of its 25% stake in the airport. Ferrovial had previously planned to sell its entire Heathrow stake. The renegotiated deal is yet to be completed, although Ferrovial has previously said it hoped to finalise it by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approval. Ardian and PIF would respectively acquire 22.6% and 15% of Heathrow\u2019s parent company for a total of \u00a33.26bn, in an agreement that would lead to other stakeholders also selling their holdings. It is unclear when Heathrow may restart its dividend, and whether the deal will have been completed by that time, leaving the airport\u2019s new owners also in line for shareholder payouts.",

Her lawyer said the \u2018shock wave\u2019 of this public trial and public video evidence was necessary to show the true horror of rape\u201d and \u201chelp prevent other women from having to go through this\u201d.</p> <p>The trial is also highly unusual because it can\u2019t rely on the victim\u2019s evidence. \u201cIn most rape trials, the alleged rape would be detailed by the victim\u2019s word against the word of the alleged attacker,\u201d Angelique said.</p> <p>\u201cIn this case, the victim was drugged and comatose with no recollection. Instead, the main defendant, Dominique Pelicot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/dominique-pelicot-france-rape-trial-testimony\">has admitted rape</a> and meticulously kept video evidence. It is that video evidence which is crucial \u2013 without it there wouldn\u2019t be a trial. So often, in other rape cases, there is no such video evidence.\u201d</p> <p>The court proceedings have highlighted confusion over what constitutes consent. \u201cMany of the men on trial with Pelicot argue that they didn\u2019t intend to commit rape, saying they thought Gis\u00e8le was pretending to be asleep and that they were pressured into it,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cThe courtroom testimony has highlighted how society in general has not yet got a clear understanding of consent.\u201d</p> <p>Could Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s conduct and the extensive media coverage of the case mark a turning point for attitudes in France, and perhaps elsewhere?</p> <p>\u201cMany French writers have said this case marks the end of a stereotype of the \u2018monster\u2019 rapist - or the notion that rapes are only carried out by strangers,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cInstead it has highlighted the dangers women face in their own homes and within marriages or relationships.

When you\u2019re raped there is shame, and it\u2019s not for us to have shame \u2013 it\u2019s for them.\u201d On the evidence she had heard: \u201cI am a woman who is totally destroyed, and don\u2019t know how I can pick myself up from this.\u201d On how she keeps going in face of what she\u2019s heard in court: \u201cIt\u2019s true that I hear lots of women, and men, who say you\u2019re very brave. I say it\u2019s not bravery, it\u2019s will and determination to change society.\u201d On whether she felt responsible for what happened: \u201cOf course today I feel responsible for nothing. Today, above all, I\u2019m a victim.\u201d Addressing her husband, who she did not want to look at, she asked: \u201cHow could you have betrayed me to this point? How could you have brought these strangers into my bedroom?\u201d On hearing wives or girlfriends or friends in court saying the accused did not seem capable of rape: \u201cWe have to progress on rape culture in society.\u201d People should learn the definition of rape, she adds. \u201cFor me they are rapists, they remain rapists. Rape is rape.\u201d The morning\u2019s hearing at the criminal court in Avignon has now closed. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot is expected to speak again at the later stages of the trial, which is due to run until 20 December. A defence lawyer asks about Dominique Pelicot being stopped for filming up women\u2019s skirts in a supermarket in 2020. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot says that at the time, she thought it was the first time he had been stopped for this behaviour and felt then that she could forgive him if he apologised to the women he had targeted. But during the police investigation, she says, she learned that he had been stopped previously for the same offence, ten years earlier in 2010, in a supermarket in the Paris area. She says she was not informed of that in 2010 and that if she had been, she may have left him - instead of enduring a decade of rape between that point and 2020. \u201cI lost ten years of my life,\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot says. \u201cIf I had been alerted in 2010, I would have been a lot more vigilant about my mental lapses.\u201d A defence lawyer asks whether Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was aware of a memoir Dominique Pelicot had written in 2011. She replies: \u201cHis daughter had asked him to write about his childhood; she knew he had had a difficult childhood. She said, \u2018You should write a memoir.\u2019\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot says she had taken the manuscript on holiday to read. She discovered while reading it that Dominique Pelicot had been raped as a child, she says: \u201cI was struck by that. I hadn\u2019t understood before that he had been raped...\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot is asked by a defence lawyer about her daughter, Caroline, telling investigators: \u201cOne night I saw my father take my mother by her neck, lift her off the ground and say he\u2019d kill her.\u201d The lawyer asks if that related to the moment Dominique Pelicot found out that she had had an extra-marital relationship. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot says it did, adding: \u201cShe was a little girl aged eight, she is not lying, but she saw a scene in the bathroom when her father came towards me. He shook me by the collar, that\u2019s right.\u201d She says: I lived with him for 50 years ... I wouldn\u2019t have stayed 50 years if he had behaved like a violent brute. Like all couples, we had arguments. We got through lots of challenges, illness, work, money. He wasn\u2019t a brute. He never hit me ... This case for me is total incomprehension. I would never have imagined a man could do this. Asked again about a possible inferiority complex felt by Dominique Pelicot, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot says: When I met Dominique, despite losing my mother very young, I had always been surrounded by love, [from] my grandmother, my aunt. I had always been in that atmosphere. Dominique was the opposite, he had a tyrannical father, he gave all his salary to his parents. The difference was that - he had lots of anger, reproach ... She says that when he met her he came into a family - her family - where there was a lot of love and gentleness. That was the difference between them, she sayds. She says her family had always supported him, and so had she: \u201cI always tried to find a balance where things were good for us\u201d. She says she tried to compensate for the difficult childhood her former husband had endured. When she met Dominique Pelicot, she says, his mother would cry because she had no money because her tyrannical husband would not give her any. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot says of Dominique Pelicot\u2019s mother: \u201cI saw how that woman, who I liked a lot, was not happy with her husband, who was tyrannical and authoritarian. We couldn\u2019t talk about anything. At table, he had to be served like a prince.\u201d She questions testimony given by Dominique Pelicot\u2019s brother, who told the court it had been a happy family. Asked how she kept going in the face of what she had heard in court, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot replies: It\u2019s true that I hear lots of women, and men, who say you\u2019re very brave. I say it\u2019s not bravery, it\u2019s will and determination to change society. Asked by her lawyer whether she should ask herself if she was responsible for what happened, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot replies: \u201cOf course today I feel responsible for nothing. Today, above all, I\u2019m a victim.\u201d After hearing wives or girlfriends or friends in court saying the accused did not seem capable of rape, she says: \u201cWe have to progress on rape culture in society.\u201d People should learn the definition of rape, she adds. Asked about some of the accused men who said they had been gently caressing her during the alleged assaults, and that this therefore did not constitute rape, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot says the men were sullying \u201can unconscious woman\u201d. She says: \u201cFor me they are rapists, they remain rapists. Rape is rape.\u201d Asked about her husband referring to her as \u201cla bourgeoise\u201d to some of the men he is alleged to have recruited to rape her, she says: It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve always liked going out well-dressed, I\u2019ve always been like that in my life, at work, even today. When I go to the market, I am always well-dressed. So if my way of dressing and way of being was bourgeoise ... I\u2019ve always been interested in literature and music. She says Dominique Pelicot did not like to go to the opera with her, it was perhaps because of that. \u201cBut I think culture is accessible to everyone today.\u201d The court president asks: \u201cYou are the daughter of an army officer, with a classic education?\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot replies: \u201cYes, with values.\u201d The president asks if that had perhaps been a problem for Dominique Pelicot. She replies: \u201cI never felt an inferiority complex from him.\u201d Asked by a judge about how Dominique Pelicot found out about her extra-marital relationship, she says had told him about it. \u201cI was in the bathroom,\u201d Gis\u00e8le says. \u201cHe had doubts. He saw I wasn\u2019t the same person. He said: \u2018I need to know\u2019, and I admitted it. For him, it was very hard. He couldn\u2019t imagine for a moment I could do that.\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot is asked about a video with her husband, shown to the court, in which she is clearly heard to say \u201cStop, stop, it hurts\u201d and to speak in a voice that is not \u201cnormal\u201d - perhaps the early stages of sedation. The court president asks: \u201cDo you think it was consenting?\u201d She replies: \u201cIt was a rape, of course it was a rape.\u201d The president describes how one of the accused men had said Dominique Pelicot had spoken of acting out of revenge against Gis\u00e8le Pelicot for her once having a relationship outside marriage. He asks if she had felt there was a particular drive for humiliation by her husband. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot replies: I have often thought that maybe he never recovered from the fact that I had met someone in my life. I often felt responsable. I thought: was it not maybe revenge, because he had so suffered from that affair? But it was years later, we had talked about that. He had affairs as well. The first man I knew was my husband, the second was my lover. We had talked about that as well. The court president asks Gis\u00e8le Pelicot about what she was wearing in Dominique Pelicot\u2019s videos of her assaults. The court heard last week how Dominique Pelicot would take off her pyjamas and dress her in other items, then re-dress her in pyjamas afterwards. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot replies: I had two drawers of my underwear, I knew my underwear well. I wore white or orange colours, I had stockings in white, I had black tights. The underwear in the videos is not my underwear. What I saw on the videos, it doesn\u2019t belong to me, he must have kept it somewhere but I didn\u2019t know. Gi\u00e8le Pelicot says that because of her concerns, \u201cI consulted three gynaecologists. Several times I had woken up and felt like I had lost my waters - as happens when you give birth.\u201d She adds: \u201cI know in the morning I take my breakfast in the kitchen, it\u2019s basic, orange juice, toast, jam, honey. He could have put it in my orange juice or my coffee. But I didn\u2019t feel that moment where I went under [as sedated].\u201d She says that she once went for a morning hairdressing appointment and her then husband insisted on driving her. She had what seemed like a black-out, she says, and didn\u2019t remember the hair cutting or styling. The court president is asking questions about the preparation of the drugs used to sedate Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. He says that Dominique Pelicot stocked the drugs in the house to serve in meals or an ice-cream after dinner. The court president asks: \u201cDo you remember moments when Dominique Pelicot invited you to drink specific things or dishes?\u201d Gis\u00e9le Pelicot replies: He made a lot of meals. I saw that as him being attentive. I know that one night he came to collect me at Avignon station after 10 days with my grandchildren. He had already prepared the meal - mashed potato. Two plates were already in the oven. I put olive oil on my potatoes and he put butter, so it was easy to see which plate was his. We would have a glass of white wine together. I never found anything strange about my potatoes. We finished eating. Often when it\u2019s a football match on TV, I\u2019d let him watch it alone. He brought my ice-cream to bed, where I was, my favourite flavour, raspberry. And I thought, \u2018How lucky I am, he\u2019s a love.\u2019 I never felt my heart flutter, I didn\u2019t feel anything, I must have gone under very quickly. I would wake up with my pyjamas on. The mornings I must have been more tired than usual, but I walk a lot and thought it was that. Of her trial, Pelicot said: I wanted all woman victims of rape - not just when they have been drugged, rape exists at all levels \u2013 I want those woman to say: Mrs Pelicot did it, we can do it too. When you\u2019re raped there is shame, and it\u2019s not for us to have shame \u2013 it\u2019s for them. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot adds: The profile of a rapist is not someone met in a car-park late at night. A rapist can also be in the family, among our friends. When I saw one of the accused on the stand last week who came into my bedroom and house without consentment. This man, who came to rape an unconscious, 57-year-old woman \u2013 I am also a mother and grandmother ... I could have been his grandmother. I am a woman who is totally destroyed, and don\u2019t know how I can pick myself up from this. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said she wanted to address her husband, calling him Dominique, but saying she did not want to look at him. \u201cSo many times, I said to myself how lucky am I to have you at my side.\u201d She said he had stood by when she thought she was ill with neurological problems (which were later found to be due to his drugging of her.) \u201cHe took me to neurologist, to scanners when I was worried. He also went with me to the gynaecologist. For me, he was someone I trusted entirely.\u201d She said: \u201cHow can the perfect man have got to this? How could you have betrayed me to this point? How could you have brought these strangers into my bedroom?\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has taken the stand, with her former husband Dominique Pelicot watching from the dock. The president of the court told her she will have the opportunity to talk about evidence so far and on the issue of drugging. Marion Dubreuil, a court reporter for RMC radio, has been sketching some of the women \u2013 wives, girlfriends and mothers \u2013 of some of the accused men whose cases were being heard in court this morning. Among those who testified in court this morning was the mother of Florian R, a 32-year-old delivery driver and father of three who is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in December 2019. The woman in her fifties told the court that she worked as a cleaner. She had Florian R before she was 20-years-old, then separated from his father three months later. She said she was cross with her son when she found out the charges. \u201cI wondered did I get something wrong in the way he was raised? I know what he did is very serious. I don\u2019t hide that.\u201d Earlier this month the Guardian\u2019s associate editor, Europe, Katherine Butler, spoke to Angelique Chrisafis about why this trial is so unusual and whether it might change French attitides to sexual violence. Trials like this are normally held behind closed doors, away from the media, but this case is being heard in public because Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \u201cwanted to draw attention to the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she called for the lifting of restrictions on the screening of video evidence in the trial. Her lawyer said the \u2018shock wave\u2019 of this public trial and public video evidence was necessary to show the true horror of rape\u201d and \u201chelp prevent other women from having to go through this\u201d. The trial is also highly unusual because it can\u2019t rely on the victim\u2019s evidence. \u201cIn most rape trials, the alleged rape would be detailed by the victim\u2019s word against the word of the alleged attacker,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cIn this case, the victim was drugged and comatose with no recollection. Instead, the main defendant, Dominique Pelicot, has admitted rape and meticulously kept video evidence. It is that video evidence which is crucial \u2013 without it there wouldn\u2019t be a trial. So often, in other rape cases, there is no such video evidence.\u201d The court proceedings have highlighted confusion over what constitutes consent. \u201cMany of the men on trial with Pelicot argue that they didn\u2019t intend to commit rape, saying they thought Gis\u00e8le was pretending to be asleep and that they were pressured into it,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cThe courtroom testimony has highlighted how society in general has not yet got a clear understanding of consent.\u201d Could Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s conduct and the extensive media coverage of the case mark a turning point for attitudes in France, and perhaps elsewhere? \u201cMany French writers have said this case marks the end of a stereotype of the \u2018monster\u2019 rapist - or the notion that rapes are only carried out by strangers,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cInstead it has highlighted the dangers women face in their own homes and within marriages or relationships. Some of the accused men had notable jobs in society such as local councillor, nurse, prison warden or journalist.\u201d The court has heard testimony from one more witness \u2013 the girlfriend of one of the accused, 31-year-old Gregory S \u2013 and will now take a 15-minute break, after which Gis\u00e8le Pelicot is expected to take the stand at about 11.30am local time. Roughly midway through the trial, which is due to last until December, she has been invited by the court to comment on and respond to the evidence and testimony that have been heard so far. This week, the court is hearing the cases of six men accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. They include a 34-year-old prison warden, a 55-year-old electrician, a 32-year-old delivery driver, a 46-year-old mirror-maker and a 31-year-old painter and decorator. One of the accused, a 47-year-old former factory worker, was driven to the Pelicots\u2019 village by his then girlfriend who waited in the car for him at the time he is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. A canteen worker, she told the court she did not know what happened that night and had not asked any questions. All of the six men will be in court when Gis\u00e8le Pelicot speaks this morning. Dominique Pelicot, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s former husband, who has admitted to drugging and raping her and said he recruited men online to rape her, was sitting in a secure glass-screened area of the court, guarded by two police officers. Every day he is brought to court from his prison cell where he is being held on remand. Here are some more pictures of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot arriving at the courthouse in Avignon this morning: The 50 men accused of rape and assault alongside Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s former husband, Dominique are aged between 26 and 74. They include a nurse, a journalist, a prison warden, a local councillor, a soldier, lorry drivers and farm workers. They each face up to 20 years in prison. In total, 49 are accused of rape, one of attempted rape and one of sexual assault. Five others are also accused of possessing child abuse imagery. Most lived in south-eastern France within a 60km radius of the village of Mazan, where the Pelicots lived. Six have previous convictions for domestic violence, two have convictions for sexual violence. A total of 23 have a criminal record for offences such as drunk-driving and possession of drugs. Some of the accused men have admitted rape but said they did not set out with this intention, and have apologised in court to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, a grandmother and former logistics manager. Others have denied the charge of rape, saying they believed they were taking part in a game by the couple. Angelique Chrisafis, who has been following the trial since it began in early September, has been compiling brief pen portraits of the men accused as they appear in court. You can read her full account here: Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has been hailed as a feminist hero across France, commended for her courage at rallies across the country and applauded by supporters each time she enters or leaves the courtroom in Avignon. But tributes to her have also come from beyond the country\u2019s borders, with solidarity from Austria to Australia hinting at the role she has played in galvanising a global conversation around sexual violence. The Guardian\u2019s European community affairs correspondent, Ashifa Kassam, takes a look at the expressions of solidarity with Gis\u00e8le Pelicot that have sprung up around the world: Gis\u00e8le Pelicot is expected to take the stand at about 11am local time. Through her lawyer, she commented on the testimony of the wife of one of the accused men this morning. A 45-year-old Vietnamese woman testified in connection to her husband, Jean Luc L, a 46-year-old mirror-maker, who is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on two occasions in 2018 and 2019. Jean-Luc L\u2019s wife of ten years, who has two children with him, told the court that because her own mother was ill at the time, she had not wanted sex with her husband and had said no to him over a long period of time. Asked how she felt when police told her of the rape charges against her husband, she told the court in a soft voice, translated by an interpreter: \u201cI was very sad, in shock. But I think because I refused him all the time, as a man he had to look elsewhere.\u201d Gisele Pelicot\u2019s lawyer, St\u00e9phane Babonneau, told the court: \u201cYou thought that because you refused a sexual relationship, because your mother was very ill and your mind was on other things, you thought you had a role in what happened, and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot could not help reacting. For her, it\u2019s not because you refused a sexual relationship that it led to this happening. Because there is never an obligation to have sexual relations with your husband. Do you understand that?\u201d Babonneau continued: \u201cGis\u00e8le Pelicot says you have no responsibility whatsoever in the fact that your husband decided to do what he did.\u201d More than a hundred members of the public had queued from before 7am outside the Avignon criminal court to listen to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot from an adjacent room where proceedings are transmitted. \u201cWhat happened was so horrible that it\u2019s important for a maximum of people to be here to show support,\u201d said one 73-year-old artist from Avignon. On fortifications opposite the court, a banner read \u201cA rape is a rape.\u201d Across Avignon, many streets had been papered with collage in support of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, with messages such as: \u201cGis\u00e8le \u2013 womeon thank you.\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot arrived at the courthouse shortly before 9am local time and was applauded by onlookers as she has been thoughout the trial, which - after requesting it be open to the public - she has attended almost daily since it began on 2 September. Franco Info radio\u2019s police and crime correspondent filmed her arrival. Hello. Today, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \u2013 the woman at the centre of the mass rape trial that has shaken France \u2013 is due to address the courtroom. Her former husband, Dominique Pelicot, 71, has admitted drugging his then-wife with sedatives and anti-anxiety medication to render her unconscious so that he and dozens of strangers he recruited in online chatrooms could allegedly rape her between 2011 and 2020 in the village of Mazan in Provence. The 50 other men on trial, aged between 26 and 74, with professions ranging from fire officer to journalist, are alleged to have been recruited by Pelicot, who said they knew they were being invited to commit rape. In almost two months of testimony, the court has heard from dozens of accused men. The majority denied rape. Some of the accused men have admitted Pelicot told them he was drugging his then-wife, but others have said they believed they were participating in a couple\u2019s organised game. The court heard briefly from Gis\u00e8le Pelicot early on the trial but now, at the midway point, judges are giving her the chance to comment on, and respond to, what the court has heard so far. The Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, is at the courtroom and we will be bringing you the latest updates from Avignon.",

With that, we have gained a&nbsp;powerful dose of a precious commodity in sport and beyond: perspective.</p> \n<p>Announced during cycling\u2019s world championships in Denmark, where Hoy was presenting, it was instantly impossible to see the next races as anything other than slightly frivolous, indulgent even. There was a new clarity that they were important but not what mattered most, no longer make or break or life-defining as commentators often suggest, and we searched for joy within these races, essential if they were to have any meaning.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/20/chris-hoy-a-remarkable-determined-human-being-unchanged-by-success\">Chris Hoy: a remarkable, determined human being unchanged by success | William Fotheringham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hoy has refocused our eyes on the bigger game we all&nbsp;play that lasts long after the finish line has been crossed, the medals awarded and the velodrome crowds gone home. He is clear that his cancer is not a win-lose game. His demeanour reminds me of the line: \u201cFor when the One Great Scorer comes to mark against your name, he writes \u2013 not that you won or lost \u2013 but how you played the game.\u201d It echoes beautifully for Hoy a century later. Turning to his old Olympic psychologist Prof Steve Peters for support, he reminds us of the importance of developing mentally as well as physically whenever faced with an immense challenge, and humbly shows that none of us comes ready or equipped for what life throws at us, Olympic champion or not.</p> \n<p>Hoy was already the ultimate role model for how to play the game, known as one of the most kind-hearted sportsmen you could meet, while simultaneously being the fiercest competitor ever seen on the track.

      "bodyText": "Chris Hoy\u2019s cancer prognosis has delivered a jolting shock to the senses, a reminder that legendary Olympic medal winners are still human and as vulnerable as any of us to life\u2019s curveballs. With that, we have gained a powerful dose of a precious commodity in sport and beyond: perspective. Announced during cycling\u2019s world championships in Denmark, where Hoy was presenting, it was instantly impossible to see the next races as anything other than slightly frivolous, indulgent even. There was a new clarity that they were important but not what mattered most, no longer make or break or life-defining as commentators often suggest, and we searched for joy within these races, essential if they were to have any meaning. Hoy has refocused our eyes on the bigger game we all play that lasts long after the finish line has been crossed, the medals awarded and the velodrome crowds gone home. He is clear that his cancer is not a win-lose game. His demeanour reminds me of the line: \u201cFor when the One Great Scorer comes to mark against your name, he writes \u2013 not that you won or lost \u2013 but how you played the game.\u201d It echoes beautifully for Hoy a century later. Turning to his old Olympic psychologist Prof Steve Peters for support, he reminds us of the importance of developing mentally as well as physically whenever faced with an immense challenge, and humbly shows that none of us comes ready or equipped for what life throws at us, Olympic champion or not. Hoy was already the ultimate role model for how to play the game, known as one of the most kind-hearted sportsmen you could meet, while simultaneously being the fiercest competitor ever seen on the track. He is as strong proof as you can get that you don\u2019t need to be nasty to win, that virtues and values always matter \u2013 a stark contrast to Nike\u2019s controversial Olympic advert this summer that stoked up outdated dark narratives that \u201creal winners\u201d lack compassion, respect or empathy for others. Sport needs perspective so badly. I really wish it didn\u2019t have to be delivered in this way, but Hoy has instantly shown up the shallowness of diving footballers and the ridiculousness of the latest transfer tittle-tattle. He may also unwittingly help a few athletes teetering at the edge of the Olympic blues, that emotional comedown when the singular goal of winning suddenly falls away once the Games are over. In finding a purpose to his predicament to reframe what it means to live with stage 4 cancer, Hoy demonstrates real resilience. Not the stiff upper lip kind, but a resilience based on our chosen response to adversity, the perspective we bring to challenges, the ability to find meaning and joy in the everyday and the prioritisation of relationships above everything else. In line with research in the military, elite athletes, people experiencing trauma or grief, resilience is founded on purpose, perspective, meaning, joy and connection.

Thousands race down the Charles river on a 4km course that winds its way through a picturesque part of Boston, Massachusetts, past the Harvard boathouses and through some beautiful bridges perched at angles that haunt the most talented of coxes and rowers steering coxless boats. Each year the regatta grows and is becoming a powerful catalyst for connecting the rowing world in new ways across countries, ages and events. I saw it in a different light after Hoy\u2019s news. The regatta innovates in a way sport needs to do more. Olympic rowers made up composite crews, in the same boat with rivals from different countries they\u2019d raced against in Paris. Britain\u2019s Olympic champion Imogen Grant led a lightweight eight who had been in separate boats for years.

It struck me how mad it is that it\u2019s so rare, how we are robbed of what could make up some of the best crews because sport is always arranged on a national basis.

      "body": "<p>Earlier this month, France\u2019s second city suffered a pair of brutal killings that appeared to be the latest in a long list of tragedies inflicted by drug-related turf wars. In a place where groups have battled for years over highly coveted \u201cpoints of sale\u201d, many of them in the city\u2019s impoverished northern neighbourhoods, the age of those involved in the latest killings was especially stomach-churning. The Marseille prosecutor, Nicolas Bessone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/06/marseille-drug-wars-in-spotlight-again-after-boy-14-hired-as-hitman-in-revenge-killing\">described how</a> following the recent gang killing of a 15-year-old, a 14-year-old had been hired to carry out a revenge killing. A prisoner had recruited the teenager, the prosecutor said, and \u201corganised the logistics for him to be collected by car and brought to a hotel room in Marseille\u201d. The 14-year-old then allegedly shot and killed the taxi driver, who had nothing to do with the drugs trade, for not waiting for him.</p> <p>Unfortunately, grim stories such as these have become one of the big reasons Marseille makes headlines not just in France, but in the English-language press too. In addition to putting the <a href=\"https://x.com/franckallisio/status/1844114726911090998\">spotlight</a> on figures <a href=\"https://www.cnews.fr/faits-divers/2024-10-09/tueur-gage-de-marseille-didier-migaud-envisage-decarter-lexcuse-de-minorite\">clamouring</a> for more <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MarineLePen/videos/3106005376335806/\">police authority</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bfmtv.com/marseille/replay-emissions/bonjour-marseille/meurtre-de-nessim-ramdane-a-marseille-la-prison-ne-fait-plus-peur-estime-la-senatrice-lr-valerie-boyer_VN-202410080149.html\">harsher prison sentences</a>, they fuel a particular image of the port city in the rightwing imagination: Marseille as the ultimate symbol of French decline, a once-great metropolis torn asunder by <a href=\"https://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/societe/pour-gagner-la-guerre-de-la-drogue-a-marseille-il-faut-retablir-une-justice-repressive-20210831\">decades of lawlessness</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bfmtv.com/marseille/narcotrafic-pour-eric-zemmour-marseille-n-est-plus-vraiment-une-ville-francaise_AV-202405150325.html\">immigration</a> that has become so dangerous it is now practically unliveable. Somehow, this reactionary fantasy hasn\u2019t yet damaged a radically different image of the city gaining steam: Marseille as a promised land for twenty- and thirtysomethings seeking sunshine, natural beauty and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/just-the-right-amount-of-edge-how-marseille-became-2024s-on-trend-city\">just the right dose</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/t-magazine/wanderlust-marseille-france.html\">urban \u201cgrit.\u201d</a></p> <p>These competing visions of the city are enough to make your head spin. But as with all cliches, the reality is far more complicated.</p> <p>According to police, Marseille did see a record number of <a href=\"https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/bouches-du-rhone/marseille/nous-sommes-inconsolables-un-appel-collectif-a-la-creation-d-un-monument-en-hommage-aux-victimes-du-trafic-de-drogue-a-marseille-2918271.html\">49 drug-related killings</a> in 2023, though the numbers are on track to be lower this year. And while the drug trade is indeed sweeping up younger participants, talk of \u201ccartels\u201d or an alleged \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tf1info.fr/amp/justice-faits-divers/video-enquete-une-mexicanisation-du-crime-et-du-trafic-de-drogue-la-dz-mafia-le-cartel-de-marseille-a-la-soif-illimitee-de-puissance-2328401.html\">Mexicanisation</a>\u201d of the business is wildly off-base. As the <a href=\"https://arenes.fr/livre/la-fabrique-du-monstre/\">award-winning author</a> and chronicler of the city\u2019s drug trade Philippe Pujol <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2024/02/inside-marseilles-drug-wars/\">told me</a> earlier this year, drug gangs in Marseille do not control production. Instead, they\u2019re fighting over distribution in a local market. Forget about Pablo Escobar or El Chapo. The situation here is much closer to something out of The Wire: in scores of poor neighbourhoods lacking jobs and opportunities, the drug trade has filled the void, exploiting the labour of teenagers at the behest of a privileged few.</p> <p>But perhaps a better way of considering the paradox of Marseille is to imagine one of those distorting mirrors at a carnival fun-house. Viewed from a certain angle, the city can indeed reflect an uglier version of France. It suffers from racialised social segregation, with poverty and drug violence concentrated far from the wealthiest areas. Basic public services can be unreliable or downright lacking, problems that could get worse as the French government prepares for an austerity budget with <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/france-eye-watering-40-billion-euro-budget-cut-2025-eu-commission-debt-michel-barnier/\">\u20ac40bn (\u00a333bn) in spending cuts</a>. Amid a dearth of jobs, the local economy relies heavily on tourism. The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d is an unmitigated failure.</p>    <p>And yet, from a slightly different angle, Marseille can resemble a more attractive version of France. For one, it\u2019s a place where people of different backgrounds do coexist. Despite the segregation, many Marseillais are accustomed to living among people who don\u2019t look or talk like they do. This is the legacy of a port city with a long history of welcoming visitors and newcomers from abroad: from Italy, Armenia and the Maghreb in particular, but also from west Africa and the Comoros in more recent years.</p> <p>It may not be a giant melting pot, but the sheer diversity encountered by residents over the years has forged a certain kind of tolerance. \u201cIt\u2019s a city that\u2019s very welcoming for people who arrive from wherever,\u201d Driss Benattia, 58, the son of Algerian immigrants who grew up in the Cit\u00e9 Busserine, a housing project in the northern neighbourhoods, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a city that allows for you to have a place in it so long as you adopt it. If you adopt Marseille, you\u2019ll be adopted by Marseille.\u201d</p> <p>As Benattia pointed out, affordability is another closely related historical benefit. \u201cEven if you didn\u2019t have a lot, you could always figure out a way to get by,\u201d recalled the musician and handyman of his younger days. \u201cYou could find a place somewhere to live and to survive.\u201d Rents are inching up, but the <a href=\"https://docs.fnaim.fr/FNAIM/docs/2024/FNAIM-Conference-de-presse-janvier-2024.pdf\">average rental price</a> in Marseille is still half the level it is in Paris, and remains on the lower side when compared with other big French cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jun/11/drug-cartels-foot-soldiers-soaring-cocaine-use-europe\">Revealed: drug cartels force migrant children to work as foot soldiers in Europe\u2019s booming cocaine trade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That open-minded spirit and relative inexpensiveness go a long way to explaining why Marseille has attracted a spate of new arrivals over the past several years, including creative professionals such as chefs, artists, musicians and writers. (For the sake of full disclosure, I could be considered part of that cohort, having fled Paris two years ago, in part for the aforementioned reasons.) This newer wave of transplants has fuelled the city\u2019s trendy aura, no doubt contributing to a rise in housing prices in the process.</p> <p>But something else seems to explains Marseille\u2019s appeal: France is arguably the most centralised country in western Europe, and in the capital, cultural production is highly stratified and highly codified, staffed by gatekeepers whose influence spans the worlds of politics and business. Looking back into the distorted mirror, Marseille seems to offer another path forward. Shouldn\u2019t the barriers to entry for hopeful artists be lower? Shouldn\u2019t people be able to create without the snobbish gaze of those who think they\u2019ve figured everything out? Shouldn\u2019t France just be more decentralised in general? </p> <p>I had initially approached Benattia for this story because he is the most Marseillais person I know, and was hoping he would wax poetic about his home town. But then he shared the terrible news: his nephew, Nessim Ramdane, was the taxi driver killed in the crime that recently shocked the city. \u201cIt always seems like it\u2019s far off until you\u2019re directly concerned,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When I asked what he thought of all the calls to beef up law enforcement, Benattia said he was sceptical. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about policing and quickly turn the page. And then it\u2019ll be <em>vive l\u2019OM </em>[the football team Olympique de Marseille], <em>vive Marseille</em> with all its parties and festivals, but the root of the problem isn\u2019t addressed. If you don\u2019t take care of the wound, then it gets infected again.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the fantasies and projections, Marseille is a poor city in dire need of investment and another approach to the failed war on drugs. Unfortunately, it appears France is moving in the wrong direction on both fronts.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cole Stangler is a journalist based in Marseille and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/paris-isnt-dead-yet-9781908906557?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Paris Isn\u2019t Dead Yet</a></p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The situation here is much closer to something out of The Wire: in scores of poor neighbourhoods lacking jobs and opportunities, the drug trade has filled the void, exploiting the labour of teenagers at the behest of a privileged few. But perhaps a better way of considering the paradox of Marseille is to imagine one of those distorting mirrors at a carnival fun-house. Viewed from a certain angle, the city can indeed reflect an uglier version of France. It suffers from racialised social segregation, with poverty and drug violence concentrated far from the wealthiest areas. Basic public services can be unreliable or downright lacking, problems that could get worse as the French government prepares for an austerity budget with \u20ac40bn (\u00a333bn) in spending cuts. Amid a dearth of jobs, the local economy relies heavily on tourism. The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d is an unmitigated failure. And yet, from a slightly different angle, Marseille can resemble a more attractive version of France. For one, it\u2019s a place where people of different backgrounds do coexist. Despite the segregation, many Marseillais are accustomed to living among people who don\u2019t look or talk like they do. This is the legacy of a port city with a long history of welcoming visitors and newcomers from abroad: from Italy, Armenia and the Maghreb in particular, but also from west Africa and the Comoros in more recent years. It may not be a giant melting pot, but the sheer diversity encountered by residents over the years has forged a certain kind of tolerance. \u201cIt\u2019s a city that\u2019s very welcoming for people who arrive from wherever,\u201d Driss Benattia, 58, the son of Algerian immigrants who grew up in the Cit\u00e9 Busserine, a housing project in the northern neighbourhoods, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a city that allows for you to have a place in it so long as you adopt it. If you adopt Marseille, you\u2019ll be adopted by Marseille.\u201d As Benattia pointed out, affordability is another closely related historical benefit. \u201cEven if you didn\u2019t have a lot, you could always figure out a way to get by,\u201d recalled the musician and handyman of his younger days. \u201cYou could find a place somewhere to live and to survive.\u201d Rents are inching up, but the average rental price in Marseille is still half the level it is in Paris, and remains on the lower side when compared with other big French cities. That open-minded spirit and relative inexpensiveness go a long way to explaining why Marseille has attracted a spate of new arrivals over the past several years, including creative professionals such as chefs, artists, musicians and writers. (For the sake of full disclosure, I could be considered part of that cohort, having fled Paris two years ago, in part for the aforementioned reasons.) This newer wave of transplants has fuelled the city\u2019s trendy aura, no doubt contributing to a rise in housing prices in the process. But something else seems to explains Marseille\u2019s appeal: France is arguably the most centralised country in western Europe, and in the capital, cultural production is highly stratified and highly codified, staffed by gatekeepers whose influence spans the worlds of politics and business. Looking back into the distorted mirror, Marseille seems to offer another path forward. Shouldn\u2019t the barriers to entry for hopeful artists be lower? Shouldn\u2019t people be able to create without the snobbish gaze of those who think they\u2019ve figured everything out? Shouldn\u2019t France just be more decentralised in general? I had initially approached Benattia for this story because he is the most Marseillais person I know, and was hoping he would wax poetic about his home town. But then he shared the terrible news: his nephew, Nessim Ramdane, was the taxi driver killed in the crime that recently shocked the city. \u201cIt always seems like it\u2019s far off until you\u2019re directly concerned,\u201d he said. When I asked what he thought of all the calls to beef up law enforcement, Benattia said he was sceptical. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about policing and quickly turn the page. And then it\u2019ll be vive l\u2019OM [the football team Olympique de Marseille], vive Marseille with all its parties and festivals, but the root of the problem isn\u2019t addressed. If you don\u2019t take care of the wound, then it gets infected again.\u201d Beyond the fantasies and projections, Marseille is a poor city in dire need of investment and another approach to the failed war on drugs. Unfortunately, it appears France is moving in the wrong direction on both fronts.

The group has not contributed money to mayoral candidates as an entity, but it did endorse Farrell and Lurie as their first and second choices for mayor.</p> <p>The organization may be sitting out the mayoral race financially, but it has spent heavily in recent years on San Francisco politics. From 2020 through 2024, campaign finance records show Neighbors SF was responsible for more than one of every $10 spent in political campaigns in the city, doling out a total of at least $8.7m.</p> <p>Keally McBride, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, said the \u201cgrey-money network\u201d and the sheer breadth of tech spending in SF\u2019s recent elections represents the industry\u2019s maturation as a political force in California. \u201cTech has more money than any other industry other than oil and gas.

Grow SF, a \u2018moderate\u2019 pressure group run by former tech workers, has put $72,000 towards defeating the progressive supervisor Connie Chan and $297,000 towards ousting the supervisor Dean Preston, the latter of whom was endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America when he won office in 2019.</p> <p>In the neck and neck mayor\u2019s race, the investors\u2019 allegiances are divided. Chris Larsen, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Ripple and a longtime donor to political causes, gave $600,000 to Breed\u2019s re-election campaign. William Oberndorf, a tech investor, serial Republican party donor and charter school proponent who co-founded Neighbors SF, gave $500,000 to Farrell\u2019s campaign and has <a href=\"https://archive.is/3ucrv\">clashed openly</a> with Lurie over the latter\u2019s attack against Farrell. Farrell\u2019s campaign is heavily backed by figures from the real estate and finance sectors. Ron Conway, an investor who was essential in Ed Lee\u2019s 2010 mayoral victory, recently gave <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2024/10/21/tech-billionaire-ron-conway-spends-big-against-sole-progressive-in-sf-mayors-race/\">$100,000</a> to a Pac opposing Peskin, the San Francisco standard reported.</p> <p>Michael Moritz, the venture capitalist, founder of two prominent political groups and owner of the San Francisco Standard, has given roughly $3m to Farrell\u2019s campaign to date. Moritz also donated $500,000 to the ballot proposition that aims to strengthen the authority of the mayor.</p> <p>Amid the growing influence of this network in local politics, there are signs that state regulators are catching up. Over the summer, Neighbors SF was hit with a <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-recall-group-gets-54k-penalty-failing-19621712.php\">$54,000 penalty</a> for failing to disclose some of the donors to the 2022 recall of then district attorney Chesa Boudin, a progressive prosecutor whose bellwether loss marked the political influence of rightwing tech money in San Francisco.</p>",

The group has not contributed money to mayoral candidates as an entity, but it did endorse Farrell and Lurie as their first and second choices for mayor. The organization may be sitting out the mayoral race financially, but it has spent heavily in recent years on San Francisco politics. From 2020 through 2024, campaign finance records show Neighbors SF was responsible for more than one of every $10 spent in political campaigns in the city, doling out a total of at least $8.7m. Keally McBride, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, said the \u201cgrey-money network\u201d and the sheer breadth of tech spending in SF\u2019s recent elections represents the industry\u2019s maturation as a political force in California. \u201cTech has more money than any other industry other than oil and gas. Chevron owned the entire city of Richmond for decades, so it\u2019s not really out of place in the Bay Area for a critical industry to end up in control of municipal politics in their backyard.\u201d In the current election cycle, Neighbors SF has put $950,000 towards boosting a ballot measure that would reduce the number of oversight commissions in the city and increase the mayor\u2019s ability to fire and hire agency heads \u2013 the measure is one of the main planks of the grey-money network\u2019s political project Other components of the network are putting their efforts into removing members of the board of supervisors. Grow SF, a \u2018moderate\u2019 pressure group run by former tech workers, has put $72,000 towards defeating the progressive supervisor Connie Chan and $297,000 towards ousting the supervisor Dean Preston, the latter of whom was endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America when he won office in 2019. In the neck and neck mayor\u2019s race, the investors\u2019 allegiances are divided. Chris Larsen, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Ripple and a longtime donor to political causes, gave $600,000 to Breed\u2019s re-election campaign. William Oberndorf, a tech investor, serial Republican party donor and charter school proponent who co-founded Neighbors SF, gave $500,000 to Farrell\u2019s campaign and has clashed openly with Lurie over the latter\u2019s attack against Farrell. Farrell\u2019s campaign is heavily backed by figures from the real estate and finance sectors. Ron Conway, an investor who was essential in Ed Lee\u2019s 2010 mayoral victory, recently gave $100,000 to a Pac opposing Peskin, the San Francisco standard reported. Michael Moritz, the venture capitalist, founder of two prominent political groups and owner of the San Francisco Standard, has given roughly $3m to Farrell\u2019s campaign to date. Moritz also donated $500,000 to the ballot proposition that aims to strengthen the authority of the mayor. Amid the growing influence of this network in local politics, there are signs that state regulators are catching up. Over the summer, Neighbors SF was hit with a $54,000 penalty for failing to disclose some of the donors to the 2022 recall of then district attorney Chesa Boudin, a progressive prosecutor whose bellwether loss marked the political influence of rightwing tech money in San Francisco.",

Tampa Bay\u2019s quarterback may not have been on Jackson\u2019s stratospheric level on Monday, though Baker Mayfield did put in another dashing outing that featured 370 yards through the air along with two early interceptions and three successive touchdown drives late in the game. Mayfield was at his truculent best as he flexed his credentials as Tampa\u2019s leader, overcoming adversity of his own doing, as well as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41932982/tampa-bay-buccaneers-mike-evans-exits-hamstring-injury\">losing receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin</a> to injury during the game.</p> <p>The 29-year-old was richly rewarded for a career year in 2023 with a $100m contract extension this offseason, and is keeping up his end of the bargain with a follow-up that is even better. Mayfield leads the NFL in passing touchdowns with 18, while he sits third in completion rate at 70.5% (up six percentage points from last season). Efficiency and accuracy issues have improved from his time in Cleveland \u2013 he finished 21<sup>st</sup> in success rate and completions in year one with the Bucs after coming 28<sup>th</sup> in the accuracy stakes with the Browns in 2020. For Mayfield to be so high up the charts now represents a hugely promising upswing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/21/deshaun-watson-cleveland-browns-injury-nfl-football\">The Browns\u2019 sad and seedy Deshaun Watson era nears its predictable endpoint</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The road to get here has been rough, being thrown on the scrapheap by the Browns of all teams would trigger impostor syndrome in the most ironclad of minds, but Mayfield has fought on. It will be fascinating to see how this atypical underdog keeps fighting without Evans and Godwin in the fray.</p> <h2>Rookie defenders</h2> <p>It is easy to forget about the defensive talents starting life in the NFL, such is the weight of expectation on the quarterbacks and receivers drafted in the first round.</p> <p>Seattle took Byron Murphy II with the 16<sup>th</sup> overall pick this year, and he has been quietly exceeding expectations \u2013 when he has been on the field. With the defensive tackle healthy they have gone 4-0 while losing the three contests Murphy missed with a hamstring injury. Seattle\u2019s run stopping is where he has had the greatest effect: they have given up 126 yards per game \u2013 helping limit opposition to only 14.3 points per game \u2013 with him and 172 yards/34.7 points per game without. He has been a steadying hand, making few splashy plays of his own while drawing attention away from his teammates so they can go to work. Seattle defensive end Dre\u2019Mont Jones was free to torment Kirk Cousins with four quarterback hits, a sack, and a pass deflection on Sunday while Atlanta were stuck in the mud fighting off Murphy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SethWalder/status/1848374344805704134\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jared Verse continues to win his pass rushes at a high rate.<br><br>27% PRWR at edge this year, ranks 4th at the position. <a href=\"https://t.co/WIQvpXThxA\">pic.twitter.com/WIQvpXThxA</a></p>&mdash; Seth Walder (@SethWalder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethWalder/status/1848374344805704134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Over at the Seattle\u2019s NFC West rivals, this year\u2019s 19<sup>th</sup> overall pick, Jared Verse, is making a name for himself with the Rams. The edge rusher is generating pressure with a 27% success rate, the fourth-highest in the NFL. The Raiders certainly felt Verse\u2019s presence as two of his tilts at the quarterback created vital turnovers. The knock on him is that he only has one sack so far. If Los Angeles can put some guidance on their missile they could have an elite playmaker.</p>    <h2>Trending down</h2> <h2>New York Giants</h2> <p>\u201cThe Giants thing I don\u2019t really understand. [Barkley] was their best player,\u201d said Bill Belichick on the Pat McAfee show. \u201cFor a couple million dollars more they could have kept him. Instead, they got a guard or somebody, I don\u2019t know. The offensive line doesn\u2019t look very good.\u201d The Giants\u2019 former defensive coordinator didn\u2019t hold back in his assessment of the poor decision making that led to a thrashing from former hero Saquon Barkley and the Eagles on the way to a 2-5 start.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rydunleavy/status/1848438460547215647\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In 54 seconds, Bill Belichick<br>\u2014 Questions Josh Ezeudu at LT<br>\u2014 Scoffs at OL rebuild <br>\u2014 Bites his tongue on Daniel Jones<br>\u2014 doesnt understand how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giants?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Giants</a> let their best player got a couple million $ (suggesting he read reporting w/ numbers in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypostsports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nypostsports</a>)<br> <a href=\"https://t.co/TSxHDRkLSS\">pic.twitter.com/TSxHDRkLSS</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Dunleavy (@rydunleavy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rydunleavy/status/1848438460547215647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>It was inevitable Barkley would remind the Giants of his worth though as Belichick pointed out the worst issue for the team is how exposed quarterback Daniel Jones has been behind a poor offensive line shattered by the loss of left tackle Andrew Thomas for the season.</p> <p>Thomas\u2019s replacement Joshua Ezeudu, a guard, allowed two sacks and three pressures while the former seventh-overall pick and, more importantly, tackle Evan Neal watched the horror show unfold from the sideline. More than likely Neal will slot in against the Pittsburgh Steelers to see how effective he can be but the omens aren\u2019t good for whoever plays quarterback if a first-rounder isn\u2019t seen as being ready to step in immediately when their rock was injured.</p> <p>Maybe Neal\u2019s stock is still tanked after allowing Jones to be sacked 11 times in a single game last season. It would certainly help explain why the G-men are kicking the tires on veteran free agent DJ Humphries in an attempt to tighten things up.</p> <h2>Jerod Mayo</h2> <p>There were no expectations that New England\u2019s head coach was going to turn the team around instantly in his first season with the Patriots, not with a roster that earned a top-three pick in this year\u2019s draft. But the signs are bleak that anything is likely to improve, even if rookie QB Drake Maye has played well enough in his two starts. The Patriots have lost six in succession with an offense that produces 14.1 points per game and a defense that allowed the 2-5 Jaguars to score 22 points in a single quarter.</p> <p>Worse, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41924421/jerod-mayo-patriots-played-soft-believes-turn-around\">Mayo called his team soft</a> after the thrashing in London while preaching throughout his career that his style is \u201cdemanding without demeaning\u201d. He is right that the team have been folding in games \u2013 in the past five outings New England have given up 167.4 yards per game on the ground \u2013 though surely a better option for Mayo would have been to adjust his coaching practices in private. His players may agree they have not been good enough. They could also be slightly confused and annoyed going into a winnable game against the New York Jets. The performance against their rivals may speak volumes as to how Mayo\u2019s players feel about their head coach.</p>",

Efficiency and accuracy issues have improved from his time in Cleveland \u2013 he finished 21st in success rate and completions in year one with the Bucs after coming 28th in the accuracy stakes with the Browns in 2020. For Mayfield to be so high up the charts now represents a hugely promising upswing. The road to get here has been rough, being thrown on the scrapheap by the Browns of all teams would trigger impostor syndrome in the most ironclad of minds, but Mayfield has fought on. It will be fascinating to see how this atypical underdog keeps fighting without Evans and Godwin in the fray. Rookie defenders It is easy to forget about the defensive talents starting life in the NFL, such is the weight of expectation on the quarterbacks and receivers drafted in the first round. Seattle took Byron Murphy II with the 16th overall pick this year, and he has been quietly exceeding expectations \u2013 when he has been on the field. With the defensive tackle healthy they have gone 4-0 while losing the three contests Murphy missed with a hamstring injury. Seattle\u2019s run stopping is where he has had the greatest effect: they have given up 126 yards per game \u2013 helping limit opposition to only 14.3 points per game \u2013 with him and 172 yards/34.7 points per game without. He has been a steadying hand, making few splashy plays of his own while drawing attention away from his teammates so they can go to work. Seattle defensive end Dre\u2019Mont Jones was free to torment Kirk Cousins with four quarterback hits, a sack, and a pass deflection on Sunday while Atlanta were stuck in the mud fighting off Murphy. Over at the Seattle\u2019s NFC West rivals, this year\u2019s 19th overall pick, Jared Verse, is making a name for himself with the Rams. The edge rusher is generating pressure with a 27% success rate, the fourth-highest in the NFL. The Raiders certainly felt Verse\u2019s presence as two of his tilts at the quarterback created vital turnovers. The knock on him is that he only has one sack so far. If Los Angeles can put some guidance on their missile they could have an elite playmaker. Trending down New York Giants \u201cThe Giants thing I don\u2019t really understand. [Barkley] was their best player,\u201d said Bill Belichick on the Pat McAfee show. \u201cFor a couple million dollars more they could have kept him. Instead, they got a guard or somebody, I don\u2019t know. The offensive line doesn\u2019t look very good.\u201d The Giants\u2019 former defensive coordinator didn\u2019t hold back in his assessment of the poor decision making that led to a thrashing from former hero Saquon Barkley and the Eagles on the way to a 2-5 start. It was inevitable Barkley would remind the Giants of his worth though as Belichick pointed out the worst issue for the team is how exposed quarterback Daniel Jones has been behind a poor offensive line shattered by the loss of left tackle Andrew Thomas for the season. Thomas\u2019s replacement Joshua Ezeudu, a guard, allowed two sacks and three pressures while the former seventh-overall pick and, more importantly, tackle Evan Neal watched the horror show unfold from the sideline. More than likely Neal will slot in against the Pittsburgh Steelers to see how effective he can be but the omens aren\u2019t good for whoever plays quarterback if a first-rounder isn\u2019t seen as being ready to step in immediately when their rock was injured. Maybe Neal\u2019s stock is still tanked after allowing Jones to be sacked 11 times in a single game last season. It would certainly help explain why the G-men are kicking the tires on veteran free agent DJ Humphries in an attempt to tighten things up. Jerod Mayo There were no expectations that New England\u2019s head coach was going to turn the team around instantly in his first season with the Patriots, not with a roster that earned a top-three pick in this year\u2019s draft. But the signs are bleak that anything is likely to improve, even if rookie QB Drake Maye has played well enough in his two starts. The Patriots have lost six in succession with an offense that produces 14.1 points per game and a defense that allowed the 2-5 Jaguars to score 22 points in a single quarter. Worse, Mayo called his team soft after the thrashing in London while preaching throughout his career that his style is \u201cdemanding without demeaning\u201d. He is right that the team have been folding in games \u2013 in the past five outings New England have given up 167.4 yards per game on the ground \u2013 though surely a better option for Mayo would have been to adjust his coaching practices in private. His players may agree they have not been good enough. They could also be slightly confused and annoyed going into a winnable game against the New York Jets. The performance against their rivals may speak volumes as to how Mayo\u2019s players feel about their head coach.",

Hall has claimed that several of those who died are living abroad or were dead before the attack, telling the court he believed that no one was \u201cgenuinely injured\u201d in the bombing. Jonathan Price, for the Hibberts, said the bomb had changed Martin Hibbert\u2019s life \u201cin every conceivable way\u201d. \u201cThey have both suffered life-changing injuries from which they will never recover,\u201d the barrister said. The court heard that Martin Hibbert sustained 22 wounds from shrapnel, and Eve Hibbert suffered a \u201ccatastrophic brain injury\u201d after a bolt from the bomb struck her in the head \u2013 leading to her being presumed dead at the scene. \u201cMartin, paralysed, saw Eve lying next to him with a hole in her head and assumed he was watching her die, unable to help,\u201d Price added. \u201cHe saw others lying dead or injured around him.\u201d Martin Hibbert described the judge\u2019s decision as a \u201ccomprehensive victory\u201d. \u201cI am really pleased with not only the overall judgment, but also the many comments of the judge as to how unacceptable Hall\u2019s behaviour was,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a comprehensive victory for us. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make much more comment until the final terms of the judgment are agreed in terms of settlements, and hopefully an injunction being imposed. However, I do want this to open the door for change, and to help protect others from what we have been put through in the future. \u201cI will be discussing this with my legal team at Hudgell Solicitors, with the aim of establishing a new law in Eve\u2019s name.\u201d",

The bar in the Rocks is known for its pastel-pink-jacketed, bubble-gun-wielding bar staff as much as it is for its Instagram-ready cocktails. A second Melbourne bar, Byrdi, was placed 35th and was a newcomer to the top 50. \u201cByrdi might very well be the most Australian bar in existence.

      "body": "<p>To define a people\u2019s past is to influence their future. The past is what constitutes the bulk of a people\u2019s identity. It is therefore not surprising that one of the biggest trends in contemporary literature centres on the theme of identity. Can there be anything more intolerable than to be told you have no history to speak of and no civilisation, and then to have a new language and civilisation imposed on you? These are the conditions that led to the literary revolt in the literatures of Black people.</p> <p>Black writers have a long history of \u201creclaiming narratives\u201d, the theme of this year\u2019s Black History Month in the UK. The narratives of ex-slaves in Britain were the first attempts at a reclamation of their dignity. Chinua Achebe\u2019s celebrated novel, Things Fall Apart, was one of the first major modern acts of a reclamation of a people\u2019s soul. It was inspired by novels of empire which showed Africans in a degrading light. African literature of the 20th century was born of a need to counter the lies told about Africa. It was at first essentially a literature of revolt, reclamation, and restitution.</p> <p>In my 2007 novel Starbook, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/19/booker-winner-ben-okri-rewrites-published-novel-to-drive-home-message-on-slavery\">which I rewrote as The Last Gift of the Master Artists</a>, published in 2023, I set out to reclaim the narrative of my people, to show something of what they were like before Europeans arrived on their shores, just before the Middle Passage. The fact, not taught in schools and universities, is that Africa had its civilisations, its written languages, its epics, its great art, its religions, its architecture, its mythologies. But Europe put it across that Africa had no past and history worth speaking about. In the process Black people were denied humanity, denied agency, and denied historical reality.</p> <p>Salman Rushdie called it the empire writing back when novelists, poets, and playwrights composed works repudiating the perceptions of the literature of empire. They were writers such as Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Efua Sutherland, Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong\u2019o, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Bessie Head and Edward Said. They hurled their fictions and poems and polemics against the monolithic implications of colonial narratives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/11/abdulrazak-gurnah-winning-nobel-prize-literature-zanzibar-priti-patel-racism\">\u2018I could do with more readers!\u2019 \u2013 Abdulrazak Gurnah on winning the Nobel prize for literature</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it was more than just writing back. The colonial enterprise was one great act of erasing the reality of a whole people\u2019s existences. Writing was an act of making their history and reality real.</p> <p>The central task of writers of the colonial or the Black experience is to claim back their humanity. This profound urge runs through the literature of Africa and the diaspora, from the 18th century to the present day. And it will continue for decades to come. That same urge found in the books of James Baldwin and Toni Morrison can also be found in contemporary Black British works such as Andrea Levy\u2019s Small Island, the poems of Linton Kwesi Johnson and Jackie Kay, Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other and Caleb Azumah Nelson\u2019s bestseller Open Water.</p> <p>This urge is there in African American writers today who in work after work undertake the reclamation of their souls, taking it back from the white narrative that imprisons them in race and suffering and slavery. Lately we have seen it from Percival Everett, whether in Erasure or the Booker-shortlisted James, in which he retells Huckleberry Finn from the enslaved Jim\u2019s perspective. Everett is the latest in a long line of authors retelling canonical white texts from the viewpoint of a Black character \u2013 Derek Walcott did it, for example, with The Odyssey, while Caryl Phillips did it with Othello. In James, Everett works out another kind of double consciousness, a subtle take on WEB Dubois\u2019s thesis about the double way the Black person functions in a white world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We are forced to create counter-classics, works that do not supplant what is already there, but interrogate them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This process of reclamation has a pedigree of centuries. The Old Testament was a reclamation of the history of the Jewish people from decades of bondage in pharaonic Egypt. Virgil, ironically in Roman colonial times, was reclaiming history with the Aeneid. In this epic Virgil was saying that out of the defeat of the Trojans something even greater than the Greeks was born. Defeat was not final. The greatest proof of that survival was that they could tell their story, from their point of view.</p> <p>All novels are covertly showing how the world is from a certain point of view, and the politics of empire pervades British fiction. In that sense literature is never innocent. It is always peddling or positing or defending a vision of how the world is. This is why literature ought to challenge the unspoken implications of its own worldview. Writers who have had their histories distorted, their cultures denigrated, need to also create a new aesthetic for their works. They need to posit other ways of being, of seeing, to show the richness and validity of other cultural and artistic possibilities.</p> <p>It is not enough to write back. One must also write enduringly.

      "bodyText": "To define a people\u2019s past is to influence their future. The past is what constitutes the bulk of a people\u2019s identity. It is therefore not surprising that one of the biggest trends in contemporary literature centres on the theme of identity. Can there be anything more intolerable than to be told you have no history to speak of and no civilisation, and then to have a new language and civilisation imposed on you? These are the conditions that led to the literary revolt in the literatures of Black people. Black writers have a long history of \u201creclaiming narratives\u201d, the theme of this year\u2019s Black History Month in the UK. The narratives of ex-slaves in Britain were the first attempts at a reclamation of their dignity. Chinua Achebe\u2019s celebrated novel, Things Fall Apart, was one of the first major modern acts of a reclamation of a people\u2019s soul. It was inspired by novels of empire which showed Africans in a degrading light. African literature of the 20th century was born of a need to counter the lies told about Africa. It was at first essentially a literature of revolt, reclamation, and restitution. In my 2007 novel Starbook, which I rewrote as The Last Gift of the Master Artists, published in 2023, I set out to reclaim the narrative of my people, to show something of what they were like before Europeans arrived on their shores, just before the Middle Passage. The fact, not taught in schools and universities, is that Africa had its civilisations, its written languages, its epics, its great art, its religions, its architecture, its mythologies. But Europe put it across that Africa had no past and history worth speaking about. In the process Black people were denied humanity, denied agency, and denied historical reality. Salman Rushdie called it the empire writing back when novelists, poets, and playwrights composed works repudiating the perceptions of the literature of empire. They were writers such as Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Efua Sutherland, Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong\u2019o, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Bessie Head and Edward Said. They hurled their fictions and poems and polemics against the monolithic implications of colonial narratives. But it was more than just writing back. The colonial enterprise was one great act of erasing the reality of a whole people\u2019s existences. Writing was an act of making their history and reality real. The central task of writers of the colonial or the Black experience is to claim back their humanity. This profound urge runs through the literature of Africa and the diaspora, from the 18th century to the present day. And it will continue for decades to come. That same urge found in the books of James Baldwin and Toni Morrison can also be found in contemporary Black British works such as Andrea Levy\u2019s Small Island, the poems of Linton Kwesi Johnson and Jackie Kay, Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other and Caleb Azumah Nelson\u2019s bestseller Open Water. This urge is there in African American writers today who in work after work undertake the reclamation of their souls, taking it back from the white narrative that imprisons them in race and suffering and slavery. Lately we have seen it from Percival Everett, whether in Erasure or the Booker-shortlisted James, in which he retells Huckleberry Finn from the enslaved Jim\u2019s perspective. Everett is the latest in a long line of authors retelling canonical white texts from the viewpoint of a Black character \u2013 Derek Walcott did it, for example, with The Odyssey, while Caryl Phillips did it with Othello. In James, Everett works out another kind of double consciousness, a subtle take on WEB Dubois\u2019s thesis about the double way the Black person functions in a white world. This process of reclamation has a pedigree of centuries. The Old Testament was a reclamation of the history of the Jewish people from decades of bondage in pharaonic Egypt. Virgil, ironically in Roman colonial times, was reclaiming history with the Aeneid. In this epic Virgil was saying that out of the defeat of the Trojans something even greater than the Greeks was born. Defeat was not final. The greatest proof of that survival was that they could tell their story, from their point of view. All novels are covertly showing how the world is from a certain point of view, and the politics of empire pervades British fiction. In that sense literature is never innocent. It is always peddling or positing or defending a vision of how the world is. This is why literature ought to challenge the unspoken implications of its own worldview. Writers who have had their histories distorted, their cultures denigrated, need to also create a new aesthetic for their works. They need to posit other ways of being, of seeing, to show the richness and validity of other cultural and artistic possibilities. It is not enough to write back. One must also write enduringly. We are forced to create counter-classics, works that do not supplant what is already there, but live alongside them, interrogating them, and offering the world intriguing alternatives. For too long literature has been defined narrowly by one set of people. But being human is a vast thing, and that very vastness will stretch and even re-imagine how the human experience can be expressed in literature. There are many Black writers who are not just writing back, but writing in celebration, wildness and freedom that have nothing to do with colonialism and empire. Reacting to history is not all that Black writers are doing. There are writers who experiment, writers of fabulism, writers of new myths. Perhaps what is needed is going beyond the limited perception of what Black writers are doing, and learning to appreciate the immense scope of their literary freedom as much as their sense of historical responsibility. It is worth remembering that this is a tradition that includes the linguistic pyrotechnics of Soyinka and the teasing mythologies of Morrison. The imagination and creativity of Black writers have already burst the bounds of historical reclamation into new worlds and stories. They constitute one of the great futures of literature.

Season to taste, then stir in the lardons, leeks, mushrooms and chicken, warm through gently and serve garnished with more parsley. \u2022 This article was edited on 23 October 2024, to correct the instruction in step 1 to skip step 2, rather than step 4, which is when the stock is made.",

The international airport recently made global headlines for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/new-zealand-dunedin-aiport-hug-sign-cap-3-minute\">new signs</a> limiting hug times at drop-off zones to three minutes. \u201cFor fonder farewells please use the car park,\u201d the signs advise.

Some critics have been whining on Facebook that it is \u201cinhumane\u201d and the \u201cnanny state gone mad\u201d. These are the same people, I imagine, who think it\u2019s a violation of their human rights to have to keep quiet in the train\u2019s quiet car and who generally can\u2019t follow basic rules of social etiquette.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/23/is-three-minutes-enough-for-a-goodbye-hug-a-new-zealand-airport-has-ruled-it-is\">Is three minutes enough for a goodbye hug? A New Zealand airport has ruled it is | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rather than being inhumane I think three minutes is an extremely reasonable amount of time for a goodbye hug, albeit a somewhat random number. How did they decide on three minutes? I don\u2019t know whether Dunedin spent millions asking McKinsey to do studies quantifying the optimal amount of affection in high-traffic public areas but, in an interview with Radio New Zealand, the airport\u2019s CEO Daniel De Bono did suggest there was some sort of rationale for the number: he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/new-zealand-dunedin-airport-hug-signs-minutes-rcna176349\">quoted a study</a> that suggests a 20-second hug is long enough to release oxytocin \u2013 the \u201clove hormone\u201d. In the interests of science, I barged in on my wife while she was working and asked for a timed hug so I could analyse the benefits of hugging for myself. After 49 seconds she told me to go away.

      "bodyText": "Parting, as we all know, is such sweet sorrow. But if you\u2019re departing from New Zealand\u2019s Dunedin airport your sorrow had better be short and sweet. The international airport recently made global headlines for its new signs limiting hug times at drop-off zones to three minutes. \u201cFor fonder farewells please use the car park,\u201d the signs advise. (You get 15 minutes of free parking for your fondling.) The three-minute hug policy, which came about because too many people were spending far too long \u2013 and sometimes being inappropriate \u2013 in the drop-off zones, has not been embraced by everyone. Some critics have been whining on Facebook that it is \u201cinhumane\u201d and the \u201cnanny state gone mad\u201d. These are the same people, I imagine, who think it\u2019s a violation of their human rights to have to keep quiet in the train\u2019s quiet car and who generally can\u2019t follow basic rules of social etiquette. Rather than being inhumane I think three minutes is an extremely reasonable amount of time for a goodbye hug, albeit a somewhat random number. How did they decide on three minutes? I don\u2019t know whether Dunedin spent millions asking McKinsey to do studies quantifying the optimal amount of affection in high-traffic public areas but, in an interview with Radio New Zealand, the airport\u2019s CEO Daniel De Bono did suggest there was some sort of rationale for the number: he quoted a study that suggests a 20-second hug is long enough to release oxytocin \u2013 the \u201clove hormone\u201d. In the interests of science, I barged in on my wife while she was working and asked for a timed hug so I could analyse the benefits of hugging for myself. After 49 seconds she told me to go away. So, in short, the data seems to suggest three minutes is more than adequate. That said, I reckon Dunedin airport missed a trick. Every single aspect of the flying experience has been aggressively split off and monetised, so why not squeeze a little extra cash out of hugs? I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t give people the opportunity to buy Passion Priority Passes for a small fee so they could upgrade to a couple of extra minutes of affection.

He insulted the nation\u2019s workers by insisting their pay is too high because from Trump\u2019s billionaire, pro-business viewpoint, that makes it too hard for US companies to compete. Trump said that workers\u2019 pay was too high even though corporate profits and the stock market were booming at the time.</p></li> <li><p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2015/08/12/trump-autos/31589899/\">suggested</a> that automakers in the midwest move some operations to the south so that they could reduce their workers\u2019 wages \u2013 the last thing that workers want. \u201cYou can go to different parts of the United States.\u201d Trump said that after the auto industry in the midwest \u201closes a couple of plants \u2013 all of sudden you\u2019ll make good deals [to lower workers\u2019 wages] in your own area\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-and-musk-discussed-firing-striking-workers-the-uaw-is-now-seeking-an-nlrb-investigation\">praised</a> the idea of firing workers who are on strike, even though that is illegal under federal law. In a conversation with his billionaire campaign supporter Elon Musk, Trump applauded the idea of corporations telling their striking workers: \u201cYou\u2019re all gone.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the greatest cutter,\u201d Trump told Musk. \u201cI look at what you do. You walk in and say: \u2018You want to quit?\u2019 I won\u2019t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say: \u2018That\u2019s OK. You\u2019re all gone.\u2019\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Trump tried to portray himself as a regular worker by donning an apron for a photo op <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/us-presidential-election-2024-updates-kamala-harris-donald-trump\">at a McDonald\u2019s</a> in Pennsylvania, but the fact is, Trump has never been a worker and has always been an owner. As an owner, he has always had management\u2019s interest at heart, particularly when it comes to workers. If Trump really wanted to be a worker, rather than an owner, he certainly could have been. Trump, who always wanted to be a billionaire and be in glitzy headlines, insults workers\u2019 intelligence when <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/20/politics/mcdonalds-donald-trump-pennsylvania/index.html\">says</a> he always wanted to be a McDonald\u2019s worker. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to work at McDonald\u2019s, but I never did.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Trump insulted the nation\u2019s factory workers by saying their jobs are such a cinch that children can do them. By <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-completely-trashes-autoworkers-disastrously-211911525.html\">saying</a> that, he showed he has very little understanding of blue-collar jobs and how hard, exhausting and sometimes dangerous they are. In a recent speech to the Economic Club of Chicago, Trump talked about auto assembly plant jobs as if they\u2019re as simple as a child assembling Lego. \u201cThey [workers] don\u2019t build cars. They take\u2019em out of a box, and they assemble\u2019em. We could have our child do it.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/30/union-members-could-be-big-trump-he-keeps-complicating-that/\">said</a> he hates overtime pay. In a speech last month in Pennsylvania, he revealed how stingy he is toward workers by saying he tried to minimize what he paid his workers by always making sure he avoided paying time-and-a-half overtime pay. \u201cI hated to give overtime. I hated it. I shouldn\u2019t say this, but I\u2019d get other people in. I wouldn\u2019t pay. I hated it.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>To win support from workers, Trump, after driving past several closed factories and steel mills in Ohio, made a marvelous promise. He sounded like the pied piper when he told thousands of workers in Youngstown that all of Ohio\u2019s lost factory jobs would be coming back with him as president. Trump even told Ohio workers not to move, <a href=\"https://www.wkbn.com/news/trump-speaks-on-jobs-tells-valley-residents-dont-sell-your-house/\">promising</a> them that the jobs would come back. But the truth is that hardly any of those factory jobs came back. Indeed, General Motors closed its giant assembly plant in nearby Lordstown not long after Trump gave his Youngstown speech. \u201cThose jobs have left Ohio. They\u2019re all coming back. They\u2019re all coming back. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t sell your house.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers (UAW), is one of the country\u2019s most successful and respected union leaders. Fain led a major strike last fall that won 25% raises from GM, Ford and Stellantis/Chrysler and the restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, plus 68% raises for new workers. Despite Fain\u2019s huge successes, Trump <a href=\"https://qz.com/trump-wants-uaw-leader-shawn-fain-to-be-fired-1851599752%20l\">said</a> at the Republican convention that Fain should be \u201cfired immediately\u201d. Why in the world was a presidential candidate saying that such a respected, inspiring union leader should be fired? That\u2019s improper interference in union affairs, and what Trump was calling for would seriously hurt the UAW\u2019s huge momentum and successes. \u201cThe leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/\">lied</a> to the country\u2019s workers and insulted their intelligence when he said he always paid contractors and workers on time and what they\u2019re supposed to be paid. Before he became president, he was notorious for paying construction contractors and workers late and for refusing to pay them the amount he had promised to pay; sometimes he would pay tens of thousands of dollars less than he was contracted to pay. Hundreds of contractors and workers had sued Trump after he failed to pay them or after he insisted on paying them far less than what the contract called for. \u201cWe pay everybody what they\u2019re supposed to be paid, and we pay everybody on time.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Trump actually <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2023/09/donald-trump-uaw-ev-biden-big-three-strike\">told</a> union members that they shouldn\u2019t pay their union dues. By saying this, Trump was essentially seeking to sabotage the country\u2019s labor unions. If workers refuse to pay their union dues, that would greatly weaken unions and their ability to fight for higher wages, better benefits, improved working conditions. Profit-maximizing corporations would love it if workers stopped paying their union dues and that undermined unions\u2019 ability to battle for better things for workers. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d</p></li> </ol> <ul> <li><p>Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace</p></li> </ul>",

In a speech last month in Pennsylvania, he revealed how stingy he is toward workers by saying he tried to minimize what he paid his workers by always making sure he avoided paying time-and-a-half overtime pay. \u201cI hated to give overtime. I hated it. I shouldn\u2019t say this, but I\u2019d get other people in. I wouldn\u2019t pay. I hated it.\u201d To win support from workers, Trump, after driving past several closed factories and steel mills in Ohio, made a marvelous promise. He sounded like the pied piper when he told thousands of workers in Youngstown that all of Ohio\u2019s lost factory jobs would be coming back with him as president. Trump even told Ohio workers not to move, promising them that the jobs would come back. But the truth is that hardly any of those factory jobs came back. Indeed, General Motors closed its giant assembly plant in nearby Lordstown not long after Trump gave his Youngstown speech. \u201cThose jobs have left Ohio. They\u2019re all coming back. They\u2019re all coming back. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t sell your house.\u201d Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers (UAW), is one of the country\u2019s most successful and respected union leaders. Fain led a major strike last fall that won 25% raises from GM, Ford and Stellantis/Chrysler and the restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, plus 68% raises for new workers. Despite Fain\u2019s huge successes, Trump said at the Republican convention that Fain should be \u201cfired immediately\u201d. Why in the world was a presidential candidate saying that such a respected, inspiring union leader should be fired? That\u2019s improper interference in union affairs, and what Trump was calling for would seriously hurt the UAW\u2019s huge momentum and successes. \u201cThe leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately.\u201d Trump lied to the country\u2019s workers and insulted their intelligence when he said he always paid contractors and workers on time and what they\u2019re supposed to be paid. Before he became president, he was notorious for paying construction contractors and workers late and for refusing to pay them the amount he had promised to pay; sometimes he would pay tens of thousands of dollars less than he was contracted to pay. Hundreds of contractors and workers had sued Trump after he failed to pay them or after he insisted on paying them far less than what the contract called for. \u201cWe pay everybody what they\u2019re supposed to be paid, and we pay everybody on time.\u201d Trump actually told union members that they shouldn\u2019t pay their union dues. By saying this, Trump was essentially seeking to sabotage the country\u2019s labor unions. If workers refuse to pay their union dues, that would greatly weaken unions and their ability to fight for higher wages, better benefits, improved working conditions. Profit-maximizing corporations would love it if workers stopped paying their union dues and that undermined unions\u2019 ability to battle for better things for workers. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace",

But it also allows for some genuinely fascinating deep analysis of other songs, particularly their soul-recharging cover of the Commodores\u2019 Nightshift, the brilliant backing vocalist Curtis King Jr reliving his improvisatory approach in real time. It also illuminates the way Springsteen structures the set list, with a two-song study of mortality in the middle (Last Man Standing into Backstreets) that is then answered by a long stretch of megahits, as a deliberate reminder to revel in life\u2019s fleeting vitality.</p> <p>When I saw this tour in Hyde Park I was granted VIP access and had the peculiar experience of watching this icon of working-class pride while stood next to email-checking investment bankers and, even more jarringly, Liz Truss. But amid the golden circle\u2019s mire of abandoned ethics were Springsteen lifers who spoke with evangelistic fervour about their icon, and Zimny captures this hardcore quotient with individual vox pops at home in their cities, be it Monza or Oslo, as well as plenty of loving footage of upturned faces mid-gig.</p> <p>Those fan interactions are each frustratingly brief, and perhaps there\u2019s a bolder Springsteen film to be made that embeds itself purely in this fan community, rather like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/30/posters-came-from-the-walls-review\">Jeremy Deller\u2019s Depeche Mode film The Posters Came from the Walls</a>. Zimny\u2019s film-making style is certainly less adventurous, but his weaving of archive footage is deftly done \u2013 it\u2019s fun to see the terrible sleeping arrangements on early E Street Band outings \u2013 and you\u2019re left with the sense that this is a unit of people for whom rocking out and blowing minds is an irresistible lifetime pursuit. \u201cAfter 50 years on the road, it\u2019s too late to stop now,\u201d Springsteen concludes, proud but with a tiny, funny note of trepidation.</p> <p>\u2022 Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band is on Disney+ from 25 October.</p>",

Crank the volume for the performances, which, though truncated, thunder out to good effect, and allow you to dwell on details closeup: Springsteen gurning ecstatically as he solos; the way he loves to let notes soar with minimalist purity before consuming them in a crash of noise. The distancing effect of the film does, frankly, show up a couple of the straight rock\u2019n\u2019rollers as blustering and workmanlike songs when in a stadium they feel energising. But it also allows for some genuinely fascinating deep analysis of other songs, particularly their soul-recharging cover of the Commodores\u2019 Nightshift, the brilliant backing vocalist Curtis King Jr reliving his improvisatory approach in real time. It also illuminates the way Springsteen structures the set list, with a two-song study of mortality in the middle (Last Man Standing into Backstreets) that is then answered by a long stretch of megahits, as a deliberate reminder to revel in life\u2019s fleeting vitality. When I saw this tour in Hyde Park I was granted VIP access and had the peculiar experience of watching this icon of working-class pride while stood next to email-checking investment bankers and, even more jarringly, Liz Truss. But amid the golden circle\u2019s mire of abandoned ethics were Springsteen lifers who spoke with evangelistic fervour about their icon, and Zimny captures this hardcore quotient with individual vox pops at home in their cities, be it Monza or Oslo, as well as plenty of loving footage of upturned faces mid-gig. Those fan interactions are each frustratingly brief, and perhaps there\u2019s a bolder Springsteen film to be made that embeds itself purely in this fan community, rather like Jeremy Deller\u2019s Depeche Mode film The Posters Came from the Walls. Zimny\u2019s film-making style is certainly less adventurous, but his weaving of archive footage is deftly done \u2013 it\u2019s fun to see the terrible sleeping arrangements on early E Street Band outings \u2013 and you\u2019re left with the sense that this is a unit of people for whom rocking out and blowing minds is an irresistible lifetime pursuit. \u201cAfter 50 years on the road, it\u2019s too late to stop now,\u201d Springsteen concludes, proud but with a tiny, funny note of trepidation. \u2022 Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band is on Disney+ from 25 October.",

      "body": "<p>In a quiet and unassuming coffee shop in Astoria, a once affordable, diverse neighborhood in Queens where rent is skyrocketing to the heights of other parts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a>, a man in a black jacket sits against the window.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t look the part of a large metropolitan city\u2019s typical politician, but Zohran Mamdani represents this area in the state legislature as the assembly member for district 36 \u2013 the first south Asian man in the state assembly and only its third Muslim.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Mamdani, 33, announced his candidacy for mayor of New York.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a representation of sets of voters that typically, in the very best scenario, have been erased from the political fabric, and in the worst scenario, have been persecuted by the political system in the city,\u201d Mamdani told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cI represent Steinway Street \u2013 the same street that Michael Bloomberg created the demographics unit within the NYPD to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/29/new-york-muslims-snub-bloomberg\">illegally surveil Muslims</a> on the basis of our faith [after 9/11]. And now the representative of that street is going to run for the same position that created that department.\u201d</p> <p>Mamdani is a millennial who watches Love Island and Love is Blind. And before he was elected as a local representative in 2020, he assumed many identities, including a foreclosure prevention counselor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/10/mr-cardamom-madhur-jaffrey-nani-video\">failed rapper</a> \u2013 a career he said helped prepare him for this very moment.</p> <p>\u201cI would stand and rap with this guy in the equivalent of a 14-seater public bus. As we waited for the bus to fill up, we would try and sell our CD,\u201d Mamdani recounted.</p>    <p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve done that, it\u2019s a lot easier to ask people on the Broadway platform of the N/W train if they\u2019ll sign your petition to get on the ballot.\u201d</p> <p>Before moving to Queens at the age of seven and taking over local leftist politics, Mamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, to parents Mahmood Mamdani, a Columbia University professor who specializes in study of colonialism, and Mira Nair, a director and producer of Mississippi Masala starring Denzel Washington and the film adaptation of the Reluctant Fundamentalist.</p> <p>When asked if he considers himself a nepo baby, Mamdani is diplomatic in his response.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave that to others. There have definitely been opportunities that have been afforded to me,\u201d Mamdani, who worked on the soundtrack for one of his mom\u2019s films, Queen of Katwe starring Lupita Nyong\u2019o, said.</p> <p>\u201cBut in local politics, I don\u2019t think it has meant that much to the people of Astoria and Long Island City.\u201d</p> <p>Though nearly a year away, the New York mayoral race is already crowded. The city\u2019s comptroller Brad Lander threw his hat in the race in July; the Democratic primary, so far, includes two state senators, Zellnor Myrie and Jessica Ramos, as well as former comptroller and current assembly member, Scott Stringer.</p> <p>All of these candidates, including Mamdani, may also have to challenge incumbent mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-adams\">Eric Adams</a>, who says he still plans on finishing his term and running for re-election \u2013 despite facing federal charges of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/eric-adams-charges-indictment\">bribery and fraud</a> for allegedly accepting foreign campaign contributions and lavish gifts from Turkish nationals.</p> <p>A socialist, Mamdani distinguishes himself from the pack on political ideology \u2013 but it probably doesn\u2019t hurt that he\u2019s young, charming and often addresses large crowds with Obama-esque orations.<br><br>\u201cWe are here to say these struggles are interconnected \u2013 whether it\u2019s BLM or BDS, it\u2019s all about justice. We are here to say you cannot disentangle this fight for freedom. You will not scare us away from this call for justice,\u201d Mamdani said into a loudspeaker in Astoria Park during a 2021 protest against the Israeli occupation in the aftermath of violence against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p> <p>Unlike many other politicians, Mamdani doesn\u2019t avoid the topic of Palestine. He cofounded his college\u2019s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter and has fought to make it a local issue.</p> <p>\u201cI think Palestine has often been a glaring contradiction in our politics for many, many years. I could not understand why we would draw a line at universal beliefs when it came to Palestinians, why we thought that everyone deserved safety, everyone deserved justice, everyone deserve freedom, except for a certain class of people,\u201d Mamdani said.</p> <p>\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen over the past year with the genocide that our country has funded and continues to fund \u2013 an Israeli military bombing campaign that has expanded into Lebanon and Syria and Yemen \u2013 we are continuing in this country to find money to kill kids while we tell public housing tenants that we don\u2019t have enough money to fix their boilers.\u201d</p>    <p>The cost of living crisis plaguing New Yorkers is another issue Mamdani cares deeply for, which he said stems from his time as a foreclosure prevention counselor. During that time, he negotiated with lenders and the city on behalf of low- to middle-income homeowners in Queens who were delinquent on their mortgage payments and on the brink of eviction.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I will bring to this race is an explicit and relentless focus to the number one issue of importance to New York City voters,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford their rent. They can\u2019t afford their childcare. They can\u2019t afford transit.

      "bodyText": "In a quiet and unassuming coffee shop in Astoria, a once affordable, diverse neighborhood in Queens where rent is skyrocketing to the heights of other parts of New York, a man in a black jacket sits against the window. He doesn\u2019t look the part of a large metropolitan city\u2019s typical politician, but Zohran Mamdani represents this area in the state legislature as the assembly member for district 36 \u2013 the first south Asian man in the state assembly and only its third Muslim. On Wednesday, Mamdani, 33, announced his candidacy for mayor of New York. \u201cThere is a representation of sets of voters that typically, in the very best scenario, have been erased from the political fabric, and in the worst scenario, have been persecuted by the political system in the city,\u201d Mamdani told the Guardian. \u201cI represent Steinway Street \u2013 the same street that Michael Bloomberg created the demographics unit within the NYPD to illegally surveil Muslims on the basis of our faith [after 9/11]. And now the representative of that street is going to run for the same position that created that department.\u201d Mamdani is a millennial who watches Love Island and Love is Blind. And before he was elected as a local representative in 2020, he assumed many identities, including a foreclosure prevention counselor and failed rapper \u2013 a career he said helped prepare him for this very moment. \u201cI would stand and rap with this guy in the equivalent of a 14-seater public bus. As we waited for the bus to fill up, we would try and sell our CD,\u201d Mamdani recounted. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve done that, it\u2019s a lot easier to ask people on the Broadway platform of the N/W train if they\u2019ll sign your petition to get on the ballot.\u201d Before moving to Queens at the age of seven and taking over local leftist politics, Mamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, to parents Mahmood Mamdani, a Columbia University professor who specializes in study of colonialism, and Mira Nair, a director and producer of Mississippi Masala starring Denzel Washington and the film adaptation of the Reluctant Fundamentalist. When asked if he considers himself a nepo baby, Mamdani is diplomatic in his response. \u201cI\u2019ll leave that to others. There have definitely been opportunities that have been afforded to me,\u201d Mamdani, who worked on the soundtrack for one of his mom\u2019s films, Queen of Katwe starring Lupita Nyong\u2019o, said. \u201cBut in local politics, I don\u2019t think it has meant that much to the people of Astoria and Long Island City.\u201d Though nearly a year away, the New York mayoral race is already crowded. The city\u2019s comptroller Brad Lander threw his hat in the race in July; the Democratic primary, so far, includes two state senators, Zellnor Myrie and Jessica Ramos, as well as former comptroller and current assembly member, Scott Stringer. All of these candidates, including Mamdani, may also have to challenge incumbent mayor Eric Adams, who says he still plans on finishing his term and running for re-election \u2013 despite facing federal charges of bribery and fraud for allegedly accepting foreign campaign contributions and lavish gifts from Turkish nationals. A socialist, Mamdani distinguishes himself from the pack on political ideology \u2013 but it probably doesn\u2019t hurt that he\u2019s young, charming and often addresses large crowds with Obama-esque orations. \u201cWe are here to say these struggles are interconnected \u2013 whether it\u2019s BLM or BDS, it\u2019s all about justice. We are here to say you cannot disentangle this fight for freedom. You will not scare us away from this call for justice,\u201d Mamdani said into a loudspeaker in Astoria Park during a 2021 protest against the Israeli occupation in the aftermath of violence against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Unlike many other politicians, Mamdani doesn\u2019t avoid the topic of Palestine. He cofounded his college\u2019s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter and has fought to make it a local issue. \u201cI think Palestine has often been a glaring contradiction in our politics for many, many years. I could not understand why we would draw a line at universal beliefs when it came to Palestinians, why we thought that everyone deserved safety, everyone deserved justice, everyone deserve freedom, except for a certain class of people,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen over the past year with the genocide that our country has funded and continues to fund \u2013 an Israeli military bombing campaign that has expanded into Lebanon and Syria and Yemen \u2013 we are continuing in this country to find money to kill kids while we tell public housing tenants that we don\u2019t have enough money to fix their boilers.\u201d The cost of living crisis plaguing New Yorkers is another issue Mamdani cares deeply for, which he said stems from his time as a foreclosure prevention counselor. During that time, he negotiated with lenders and the city on behalf of low- to middle-income homeowners in Queens who were delinquent on their mortgage payments and on the brink of eviction. \u201cWhat I will bring to this race is an explicit and relentless focus to the number one issue of importance to New York City voters,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford their rent. They can\u2019t afford their childcare. They can\u2019t afford transit. They can\u2019t afford their groceries. \u201cThe mayor has an incredible set of powers to provide relief in each of those areas, and yet, at every opportunity that has been given is almost always taken the decision to exacerbate the cost of living crisis, and that\u2019s why working-class New Yorkers are being pushed out of the city that they built, the one that they call home.\u201d The young politician has built somewhat of a reputation for putting his body on the line for the causes he supports, sometimes literally. Mamdani is credited by hundreds of the city\u2019s taxi drivers for helping secure life-changing debt relief for them. In 2021, Mamdani went on a 15-day hunger strike to protest of predatory loans that targeted the taxi drivers who purchased \u201cmedallions\u201d, the physical certificate required to operate a yellow cab. The city eventually caved and struck a deal with medallion loan guarantors, securing $450m in transformative debt relief for these drivers. It was just one of the \u201chandful of times\u201d Mamdani was arrested for a cause. Mamdani was arrested again earlier this year at Hunter College, where the city\u2019s rent guidelines board voted to increase the rents of rent-stabilized tenants 2.75% on one-year leases and 5.25% on two-year leases. If elected, Mamdani says he will immediately freeze these tenants\u2019 rent upon assuming office. His policies have already garnered the support of one group: the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. The organization, which helped elect fellow socialist US house representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who also represents some of the same areas as Mamdani at the federal level, endorsed Mamdani on Saturday. \u201cNYC-DSA has officially decided to endorse Zohran Mamdani in the June 2025 Democratic primary election for mayor of New York City,\u201d the political organization told members after its annual convention. \u201cNow, it\u2019s time for us to get to work to replace our corrupt, autocratic mayor with a proven socialist and a cadre-member of NYC-DSA.\u201d Mamdani said he plans to work \u2013 every day of his campaign \u2013 on making New York more affordable. \u201cWe all love this city, and yet it doesn\u2019t mean much if we can\u2019t afford to stay here.

      "bodyText": "With two weeks to go before election day, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are essentially tied. Neither candidate is ahead by even a single point in the New York Times\u2019s polling average of five critical battleground states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin and North Carolina. How is this possible? Even if polls were systematically off and Harris were ahead of Trump by, say, 5%, I\u2019d still be appalled that so many Americans in swing states were supporting Trump. I\u2019ve spent most of my life fighting bullies, from the grade-school bullies who teased and threatened and occasionally pummeled me, to the white supremacists of the 1960s who murdered my friend Mickey Schwerner when he was trying to register Black voters in Mississippi. I\u2019ve protested Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Vietnam war and worked to get Richard Nixon \u2013 whose henchmen broke into the Watergate complex and who then tried to cover up his illegal acts \u2013 impeached. I watched Ronald Reagan bully Americans into accepting the cruel hoax of \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economics and legitimize corporate bashing of labor unions. I witnessed George W Bush insist on invading Iraq based on a lie that Iraq contained \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d, invading Afghanistan because it contained terrorists, and establishing a gulag of torture chambers across the world. When I was US secretary of labor, I fought Republican bullies who wanted to make it easier for CEOs and their major investors to become richer by shafting their workers. Later, I fought Wall Street bullies who gambled away other people\u2019s money and then, when their bets turned bad, got bailed out by taxpayers. But in all my years, I have never come across a bully more squalid than Donald Trump. He is the bully of all bullies. He emits dangerous lies like most people breathe. He has demeaned and degraded our system of self-government, attempted a coup against the United States, divided Americans with venomous bigotry, and rewarded his rich backers with tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Trump created a supreme court that took away women\u2019s rights over their own bodies and immunized presidents from criminal liability. In recent weeks, he has become even more untethered from reality, more unhinged, even less coherent. He says that if he gets back in power he will wreak vengeance on his political opponents \u2013 including many loyal Americans who have stood up to him \u2013 calling them the \u201cenemy within\u201d and openly threatening to use the US military against them. He says he wants to cleanse America of \u201cscum\u201d and \u201cvermin\u201d, including refugees, immigrants, and Democratic officials like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi. He is threatening to strip television networks of their ability to broadcast news because of coverage he doesn\u2019t like. On Sunday, he said he had subpoenaed the records of CBS, claiming that the network\u2019s edit of Harris\u2019s recent appearance on 60 Minutes was misleading. He refuses to be bound by the results of the upcoming election. This means America will likely suffer weeks or months of litigation following election day, perhaps even accompanied by violence. I felt hopeful in late July, when Joe Biden selflessly bowed out of the election and passed the baton to his vice-president, Kamala Harris. And even more hopeful as Harris has proven herself a tough, exuberant, powerful campaigner and force for positive change. Her debate performance against Trump was the best I\u2019ve ever seen. But at this moment, I\u2019m frankly worried. How can so many Americans be blind to who Trump is and what he intends to do? I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s all due to misogyny and racism. Surely, gender and race continue to play a large part in our politics, but they alone cannot explain what is happening. Nor do I think it\u2019s because of our collective amnesia about the chaos Trump wrought during his presidency. Most of us recall how horrific it was, including a pandemic that for months he refused to acknowledge or act on. Part of the reason may be that we want to normalize our politics and pretend that this election is like any other, even in the face of all the evidence to the contrary. To accept the reality of who Trump is and what he aims to do is simply too frightening. Part of it also may be that many Americans would prefer blowing up the system as a whole \u2013 destroying democracy and our institutions of self-government \u2013 than settle for gradual change because they feel the system is hopelessly rigged against them. Beyond these possible explanations lie specific people who are also responsible for bringing us to the brink of this disaster. High on my list is Rupert Murdoch \u2013 whose Fox News, New York Post and editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal have amplified Trump\u2019s lies, spreading them repeatedly to tens of millions of Americans. There\u2019s also Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, whose X platform, formerly known as Twitter, has become a font of disinformation, incendiary conspiracy theories, pro-Trump garbage and hateful lies about Harris. Musk continues to claim, for example, that Democrats are flying huge numbers of undocumented immigrants into swing states to vote illegally. One such post got 34m views. Musk\u2019s pro-Trump Super Pac has hired an estimated 400 staffers in the seven key battleground states and a platoon of Republican party operatives. The New York Times reports that Trump and Musk are speaking directly multiple times a week. That\u2019s a likely violation of campaign finance laws barring coordination between candidates and Super Pacs. Trump\u2019s other major financial backers include a cavalcade of billionaires \u2013 notably Miriam Adelson (wife of deceased casino magnate Sheldon Adelson), Liz and Dick Uihlein (owners of packaging-materials company Uline), and Timothy Mellon (scion of the Gilded Age baron Andrew Mellon). Another contributing reason Trump is running neck-and-neck with Harris is the silence of respected business leaders. Heading the list is Jamie Dimon, CEO and chair of JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank, who calls himself \u201ca patriot before I\u2019m the CEO of JPMorgan\u201d and who regularly speaks out about the injustices and inequalities of contemporary America. A lifelong Democrat, Dimon is considered the \u201cspokesman\u201d of American business. Yet when it comes to denouncing the biggest threat to American democracy since the civil war, Dimon\u2019s silence has been deafening. Who else is responsible? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Vladimir Putin were again seeding the election with hackers and bots favoring Trump, as Putin did in 2016. At this juncture \u2013 two weeks from election day, with the race virtually tied in battleground states \u2013 none of us who cares about the future of this country can any longer afford to be a mere spectator. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment. A five-alarm fire. A category 5 hurricane. Do whatever you can.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Kamala Harris said that the US was \u201cabsolutely\u201d ready for a female president, insisting that voters cared about candidates\u2019 policies, not their gender. The vice-president\u2019s statement came during an interview with NBC News\u2019s Hallie Jackson, who asked if she thought voters were ready for a woman, and a woman of color, to lead the country. Harris responded: \u201cAbsolutely. Absolutely.\u201d \u201cIn terms of every walk of life of our country,\u201d Harris said, \u201cpart of what is important in this election is really, not really turning the page \u2013 closing a chapter, on an era that suggests that Americans are divided.\u201d She added that the overwhelming majority have more in common \u201cthan what separates us\u201d. What else did Harris say? She reiterated that she represented a break with the Biden administration, and said she was aware that Trump might try to thwart the election results. Trump alleges election meddling by UK Labour party volunteer door-knockers Citing the American revolution while misspelling Britain as \u201cBritian\u201d, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has filed a remarkable complaint against UK Labour, accusing it of election interference. It alleged that Labour recruited and sent party members to campaign for Harris in key battleground states, and sought to paint parallels with the American revolution. \u201cWhen representatives of the British government previously sought to go door-to-door in America, it did not end well for them,\u201d the letter from Trump\u2019s legal team to the Federal Election Commission in Washington says. The claims were rejected by the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who said party officials volunteering for Harris were \u201cdoing it in their spare time\u201d and not in a Labour capacity. Starmer told reporters that this was nothing new: \u201cThe Labour party \u2026 volunteers, have gone over pretty much every election. They\u2019re doing it in their spare time, they\u2019re doing it as volunteers, they\u2019re staying, I think, with other volunteers over there.\u201d If Trump wins, will this harm relations between the UK and US? Starmer has insisted it won\u2019t \u2013 that he has a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Trump that would not be jeopardised by the complaint. With two weeks to go, what else is going on in the Trump campaign? Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, John Kelly, has claimed the ex-president \u201cfalls into the general definition of fascist\u201d. Israel confirms killing of Hezbollah\u2019s presumed next leader Israel has confirmed that it killed Hashem Safieddine, the presumed next leader of Hezbollah, in an airstrike on southern Beirut three weeks ago. Israel also killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last month. Safieddine was the head of Hezbollah\u2019s highest political decision-making body, the executive council, and had reportedly been chosen as Nasrallah\u2019s successor some years ago. The confirmation means that only Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s deputy secretary general, remains alive among the group\u2019s public-facing senior leadership. Who will lead Hezbollah? Israel says the strike that killed Safieddine also killed another 25 Hezbollah leaders. It remains unknown who will assume the role. What is the latest from Gaza? Israel\u2019s siege of northern Gaza means Palestinians there \u201care rapidly exhausting all available means for their survival\u201d, the UN\u2019s humanitarian office warned. In other news \u2026 Gis\u00e8le Pelicot takes the stand on Wednesday in France to comment on the evidence presented so far in the rape trial that involves her ex-husband and 50 other men. A multi-state E coli outbreak that resulted in one death has been linked to McDonald\u2019s Quarter Pounder hamburgers, the US public health authorities said, with 49 cases reported across 10 states. China is cracking down on the use of puns online, one of the last ways citizens can safely discuss sensitive subjects without censorship. Hundreds more babies died in the US than expected in the 18 months after Roe v Wade was overturned, research has found. Stat of the day: 7% fall in US-Mexico border arrests The number of arrests for illegally crossing the US-Mexico border dropped to a four-year low in September, authorities said on Tuesday, falling by 7%. The White House said the decrease was a result of toughening up asylum restrictions in June.

In the end, she was lucky: her bank reimbursed her in full. But, as she learned, it\u2019s not just about the money. With scams sharply up since the pandemic, Crockett looks at the impact of cons on victims\u2019 psyches, with one telling her she felt \u201cviolated and abused\u201d. Climate check: Cop29 host Azerbaijan \u2018set for major fossil gas expansion\u2019 Azerbaijan, the host of the Cop29 global climate summit, is planning a big increase its production of fossil gas over the next decade, a report can reveal. The researchers warned that it meant it had a \u201cvested interest in keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels\u201d \u2013 three years after the International Energy Agency said that no new fossil fuel exploitation should take place if CO2 emissions were to attain net zero by 2050.

His liberty was secured after a bird expert brought in another cockatoo, named Old Lady Doris, to calm Mickey down, leading to some \u201creally cute scenes where they were canoodling with each other\u201d, a bird sanctuary boss, Ravi Wasan, said.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has set a deadline of 18 December for the first phase of its investigation into the deal. Britvic \u2013 maker of brands including Robinsons squash, J20 and R White\u2019s lemonade \u2013 accepted a \u00a313.15-a-share offer from Carlsberg in July. This came after it had rejected previous takeover offers from Carlsberg on the grounds that they undervalued the company. Carlsberg has said the deal would allow it to combine Britvic\u2019s soft drinks products with its own beer offering, creating a beverage \u201cpowerhouse\u201d in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. The regulator said in September it was looking into whether the deal could reduce competition in the UK market, and has now decided to launch a formal investigation. After the December deadline, the CMA will decide whether to conduct an in-depth phase 2 investigation into the deal or give it the green light. A spokesperson for Carlsberg said the CMA\u2019s investigation was \u201ca normal process that was expected, and we look forward to working constructively with the CMA as it progresses\u201d. They added: \u201cWe believe that the combination of Carlsberg\u2019s business with Britvic will create a highly attractive multi-beverage supplier, benefiting from an efficient supply chain and distribution network, and providing customers with a portfolio of market-leading brands and leading customer service.\u201d Provided the deal is approved by the regulator and other conditions are satisfied, the brewer hopes to complete the transaction in the first quarter of 2025. Carlsberg hopes to find annual cost savings of about \u00a3100m over five years through the deal, including through procurement and supply chain efficiencies as well as economies in administration and overheads. Britvic, headquartered in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, was founded in the UK in the 1930s as the British Vitamin Products Company and used soft drinks as an affordable way of supplying vitamins to consumers. It has 39 brands in 100 countries including Brazil, France and Ireland. It also has an exclusive licence with PepsiCo in Great Britain and Ireland to make and sell Pepsi Max, 7UP, Rockstar Energy and Lipton Ice Tea. Carlsberg said previously it had secured an agreement from PepsiCo to waive a clause in its bottling contract with Britvic that would have allowed it to cancel the arrangement on the event of a change of ownership. In June, Britvic rejected a \u00a33.1bn takeover bid by Carlsberg, saying it undervalued the company, before accepting an improved offer the following month. Britvic is also well known for its Robinsons brand, which had a prominent sponsorship partnership with the Wimbledon tennis tournament that was one of the longest-running in sport, and lasted for 86 years before it ended in 2022.

The bouncy crunch of drum machines collides with slick, soaring vocals, as the women then jump over one another\u2019s heads. \u201cI broke my ankle doing some of this stuff,\u201d says Stacy Francis of the lively music video for You (You\u2019re the One for Me) by her group Ex Girlfriend. \u201cSome of what we were doing was unheard of at the time. There wasn\u2019t anything like that before we came along.\u201d</p> <p>Populated by the likes of En Vogue, SWV, Pebbles, Karyn White, Jade, Xscape and others, this was new jill swing, the female counterpart to new jack swing, which exploded in the late 1980s and early 90s by fusing US hip-hop with pop and R&amp;B. It would go on to shape R&amp;B as we know it but came at a cost for many of the women involved. \u201cIt was an exciting road,\u201d says Francis. \u201cBut it was also rough and heartbreaking.

Our manager wanted us to stay away from it because he was a lot older than us.\u201d</p> <p>The person who changed that mindset was producer Teddy Riley. \u201cThere was a snobbery around rap,\u201d recalls Joyce Irby, one of the more experienced artists on the scene. In the early 80s she released her own rap track, A Wild and Crazzy Song, and joined pop-R&amp;B group Klymaxx before becoming a solo artist on Motown Records. \u201cBut Teddy\u2019s stuff was so musical.

      "bodyText": "A flash of Technicolor fills the screen, as four women spin and glide in perfect unison. The bouncy crunch of drum machines collides with slick, soaring vocals, as the women then jump over one another\u2019s heads. \u201cI broke my ankle doing some of this stuff,\u201d says Stacy Francis of the lively music video for You (You\u2019re the One for Me) by her group Ex Girlfriend. \u201cSome of what we were doing was unheard of at the time. There wasn\u2019t anything like that before we came along.\u201d Populated by the likes of En Vogue, SWV, Pebbles, Karyn White, Jade, Xscape and others, this was new jill swing, the female counterpart to new jack swing, which exploded in the late 1980s and early 90s by fusing US hip-hop with pop and R&amp;B. It would go on to shape R&amp;B as we know it but came at a cost for many of the women involved. \u201cIt was an exciting road,\u201d says Francis. \u201cBut it was also rough and heartbreaking. There was a lot of exploitation.\u201d The scene is now being revisited in a new compilation put together by Saint Etienne\u2019s Bob Stanley. \u201cIt seems crazy that these two things were so separate,\u201d says Stanley of the now permanently interlocked genres of rap and R&amp;B. \u201cHip-hop was still not completely respected at that point as an art form,\u201d explains Tara Kemp, whose 1991 US Top 10 hit Piece of My Heart features on the compilation. Pop radio stations demanded a version with its rap removed. \u201cA lot of people still didn\u2019t think hip-hop was music,\u201d Kemp says. \u201cIt was like when rock\u2019n\u2019roll came around and your grandparents would be like: \u2018It\u2019s not gonna last!\u2019\u201d recalls Shireen Crutchfield, who was the lead singer of the Good Girls, a group who were marketed as the Supremes of the new movement. \u201cNew jack swing was definitely a generational thing \u2013 a distinct departure from what was before. Our manager wanted us to stay away from it because he was a lot older than us.\u201d The person who changed that mindset was producer Teddy Riley. \u201cThere was a snobbery around rap,\u201d recalls Joyce Irby, one of the more experienced artists on the scene. In the early 80s she released her own rap track, A Wild and Crazzy Song, and joined pop-R&amp;B group Klymaxx before becoming a solo artist on Motown Records. \u201cBut Teddy\u2019s stuff was so musical.

      "bodyText": "The European Commission is refusing to publish the findings of a human rights inquiry into Tunisia it conducted shortly before announcing a controversial migration deal with the increasingly authoritarian north African country. An investigation by the EU ombudsman found that the commission quietly carried out a \u201crisk management exercise\u201d into human rights concerns in Tunisia but will not disclose its results. Until now, Brussels has repeatedly stated there was no need for a human rights impact assessment into last year\u2019s deeply contentious deal that has been linked to myriad abuse allegations. \u201cThe ombudsman found that, despite repeated claims by the commission that there was no need for a prior HRIA [human rights impact assessment], it had in fact completed a risk management exercise for Tunisia before the [deal] was signed,\u201d the watchdog said in a report published on Wednesday. Unveiled in July 2023, the \u20ac150m (\u00a3125m) EU-Tunisia migration pact is aimed at preventing people from reaching Europe and was announced amid concerns that the north African state was increasingly repressive and its police operated largely with impunity. A Guardian investigation last month revealed abuses by EU-funded security forces in Tunisia, including allegations that members of the Tunisian national guard were raping migrant women and beating children. Days later, evidence was passed to the international criminal court (ICC) chronicling widespread abuse of sub-Saharan migrants by the Tunisian authorities. The situation is unlikely to have improved since then, with the re-election of Tunisia\u2019s autocratic president, Kais Saied, who has a record of racist tirades against migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. The ombudsman, Emily O\u2019Reilly, in her report admonished the European Commission for withholding what it knew about human rights abuses before announcing the deal, saying it should have been \u201cmore transparent\u201d. O\u2019Reilly added that carrying out an explicit human rights impact assessment would have been \u201cpreferable\u201d because they were normally made public. Other areas of concern identified by O\u2019Reilly, a former journalist, include what processes were in place to suspend or review funding when human rights violations were linked to EU funding. She urged \u201cconcrete criteria\u201d to be agreed for when EU funding would be suspended to projects in Tunisia owing to human rights violations. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed that the EU was unable to claw back any of the \u20ac150m (\u00a3125m) paid to Tunisia in the migration deal despite the money being linked to human rights abuses. O\u2019Reilly also wants organisations monitoring human rights in Tunisia to set up complaint mechanisms whereby individuals can report alleged violations linked to EU-funded projects. Responding to the watchdog, the commission said its \u201crisk management exercise\u201d into human rights abuses in Tunisia was something it conducted with all partner countries that might receive EU budget support. It added that the exercise took into account criteria similar to those in a normal HRIA, including \u201chuman rights, democracy, the rule of law, security and conflict in the relevant partner country\u201d. \u201cThe commission has, however, not proactively shared this information, including in its reply to the ombudsman\u2019s strategic initiative on this matter,\u201d said the report. A commission spokesperson said: \u201cThe EU is a strong promoter and strongly advocates for the respect of human rights across the world, including in Tunisia. \u201cThe commission takes note of the decision and suggestions for improvement of the European ombudsman and reiterates its full commitment to transparency and accountability.\u201d They added that its approach towards a \u201chuman-rights based approach to migration management\u201d was in accordance with its obligations under international law.",

      "body": "<p>Patricia Scotland, the departing secretary general of the Commonwealth, has described the 56-member-bloc as a powerful force in the battle against climate breakdown, and urged the members to continue her legacy of supporting small and vulnerable countries.</p> <p>Lady Scotland\u2019s two-term tenure began in 2016, shortly after tropical storm Erica destroyed 95% of Dominica\u2019s GDP. \u201cI came in understanding that this was an immediate threat to human lives, jobs, homes, infrastructure, and our very existence, and urgent action was our only option,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She will complete her term in March next year, but this week 56 country leaders will choose her successor from three African candidates at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in Samoa.</p> <p>The Labour life peer and former UK attorney general is the sixth person and first woman to hold the influential post.</p> <p>Scotland, who was born on the Caribbean island of Dominica, said that one of her priorities in office had been to secure <a href=\"https://thecommonwealth.org/our-work/commonwealth-climate-finance-access-hub\">financing for climate action</a> in developing countries.</p> <p>Pointing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/03/caribbean-hurricane-beryl-storm\">the devastation caused by Hurricane Beryl</a>, which demolished more than 90% of buildings in parts of Grenada and St Vincent and the Grenadines and left thousands homeless and without running water, electricity and food, she said:</p> <p>\u201cThis is the new reality that we face. Once a rare occurrence, hurricanes are severely damaging small island economies with greater intensity and regularity. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-maria\">Hurricane Maria</a> devastated my own country of birth, Dominica. In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hurricane-dorian-bahamas-death-toll-devastation\">Dorian, the most powerful hurricane to ever hit the Bahamas</a>, tore through the island nation, causing billions in damage.

      "bodyText": "Patricia Scotland, the departing secretary general of the Commonwealth, has described the 56-member-bloc as a powerful force in the battle against climate breakdown, and urged the members to continue her legacy of supporting small and vulnerable countries. Lady Scotland\u2019s two-term tenure began in 2016, shortly after tropical storm Erica destroyed 95% of Dominica\u2019s GDP. \u201cI came in understanding that this was an immediate threat to human lives, jobs, homes, infrastructure, and our very existence, and urgent action was our only option,\u201d she said. She will complete her term in March next year, but this week 56 country leaders will choose her successor from three African candidates at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in Samoa. The Labour life peer and former UK attorney general is the sixth person and first woman to hold the influential post. Scotland, who was born on the Caribbean island of Dominica, said that one of her priorities in office had been to secure financing for climate action in developing countries. Pointing to the devastation caused by Hurricane Beryl, which demolished more than 90% of buildings in parts of Grenada and St Vincent and the Grenadines and left thousands homeless and without running water, electricity and food, she said: \u201cThis is the new reality that we face. Once a rare occurrence, hurricanes are severely damaging small island economies with greater intensity and regularity. In 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated my own country of birth, Dominica. In 2019, Dorian, the most powerful hurricane to ever hit the Bahamas, tore through the island nation, causing billions in damage. In 2023, Vanuatu was devastated by a category five cyclone, Lola.\u201d Scotland has argued that small island developing states, which have done the least to cause the climate crisis and have contributed only 1% of all global CO2 emissions, should be given easier and greater access to climate finance. She argues that their vulnerability to natural disasters should be taken into account in decision-making on development grants. During her time as secretary general, the Commonwealth has helped its developing countries secure $363m (\u00a3280m) worth of climate action funding, with $500m (\u00a3385m) more in the pipeline. \u201cIt was a huge privilege to be selected as the sixth secretary general and the second Caribbean person to hold the post,\u201d she said, paying tribute to the late Sir Shridath Ramphal from Guyana, who was secretary general from 1975 to 1990. \u201cI felt the weight of that honour, not least because if you look at the 33 small states in our Commonwealth \u2013 who are actually the majority \u2013 25 of them are small island developing states.\u201d The danger is not just in the Caribbean. Commonwealth nations in every region are facing record-breaking and deadly hurricanes, cyclones, floods and droughts, and Pacific islanders are watching their land and property disappear under alarming sea-level rises. Scotland said this new trend of more frequent and intense natural disasters had fuelled her advocacy and her resolve to find solutions. \u201cRight at the beginning of my tenure, I convened experts: oceanologists, climatologists, those working in the symbiotic economy, circular economy, so that we could encourage them to get out of their silos, and so we could better understand the issue of climate change and focus on solutions. \u201cThis was 2016, and at that time we were looking at everything, including the ocean. And what we understood was that, historically, the ocean had acted as a coolant \u2013 but now, as sea levels were rising and the ocean [was] becoming polluted, its temperature was increasing, and it was instead becoming an accelerant for storms \u2026 So, hurricanes that would otherwise be a 1 or 2 on the scale will be whipped into life-threatening category 5 monster storms.\u201d The secretary general is hoping her innovations to tackle these challenges, such as the Commonwealth Blue Charter, which all 56 countries have signed up to, and that aims to protect ocean ecosystems and address issues such as pollution, will continue to benefit countries. The Commonwealth, she said, is a powerful union that was instrumental in achieving global commitments such as the Paris climate agreement in 2015, and can be a platform for climate solutions. Climate action and climate justice are expected to dominate the agenda in Samoa this weekend, with Britain facing growing calls before the summit to do more to support developing nations with financing to recover from natural disasters. The issue of reparations for the damaging legacy of the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans and chattel slavery has also come into the spotlight in the runup to the summit. Asked whether this will be discussed at Chogm, Scotland said: \u201cOne of the benefits of the Commonwealth platform is that everybody is around that table \u2013 everybody who is affected, every region who participated in any way is around the table, because quite often in other spheres, someone is left out \u2026 \u201cOur leaders have the opportunity to discuss if they wish to, but it\u2019s up to them.

Cases reached their <a href=\"https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772707624001309?via%3Dihub\">highest number on record</a> in 2023, with 6.5m reported globally \u2013 and 2024 looks likely to double that figure, with 12.4m <a href=\"https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/dengue_global/\">cases so far</a>.</p> <p>The mosquitoes that spread the virus are benefiting from increased urbanisation, and changes in climate and temperature. At the same time high obesity rates and other chronic health conditions are making people more vulnerable, scientists say.</p> <p>Dengue is sometimes known as \u201cbreakbone fever\u201d \u2013 a description that resonated with Braga. \u201cI consider myself to have a high pain tolerance, but the pain was so intense.\u201d</p> <p>She needed hospital treatment, after deteriorating to the point that she was vomiting and could no longer eat or drink. \u201cEven after being hospitalised for five days, I only gradually started getting better. The fatigue, in particular, didn\u2019t leave me for about 15 days,\u201d she says. </p> <p>The World Health Organization estimates that 4 billion people are at risk of dengue and related viruses, rising to 5 billion by 2050.

But a second type can also spread the virus: <em>Aedes albopictus</em> \u2013 the tiger mosquito. It can survive in a greater range of temperatures, and has established itself in new areas.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe fatigue was so bad I couldn\u2019t stand, and that\u2019s terrible when you need to take care of a child, right? My head hurt, my eyes hurt \u2013 I couldn\u2019t keep them open for long,\u201d remembers Ana Lu\u00edsa Braga. The 38-year-old, a social worker and mother of a three-year-old, from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais state in Brazil, fell ill with dengue fever in March. She is one of millions to feel the effects of the virus this year as the world grapples with its largest ever outbreak. Cases reached their highest number on record in 2023, with 6.5m reported globally \u2013 and 2024 looks likely to double that figure, with 12.4m cases so far. The mosquitoes that spread the virus are benefiting from increased urbanisation, and changes in climate and temperature. At the same time high obesity rates and other chronic health conditions are making people more vulnerable, scientists say. Dengue is sometimes known as \u201cbreakbone fever\u201d \u2013 a description that resonated with Braga. \u201cI consider myself to have a high pain tolerance, but the pain was so intense.\u201d She needed hospital treatment, after deteriorating to the point that she was vomiting and could no longer eat or drink. \u201cEven after being hospitalised for five days, I only gradually started getting better. The fatigue, in particular, didn\u2019t leave me for about 15 days,\u201d she says. The World Health Organization estimates that 4 billion people are at risk of dengue and related viruses, rising to 5 billion by 2050. The rapid spread over recent years is \u201can alarming trend\u201d, says WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. On 3 October, he launched a global strategy \u201cto fight rising dengue\u201d and other diseases spread by the same mosquitoes, such as Zika and chikungunya. Actions in the plan, ranging from surveillance to mosquito control efforts, will require $55m (\u00a342m) over the next year. Deadly combination of factors Most of this and last year\u2019s dengue cases are in Latin America, with high numbers also reported in parts of Africa and south-east Asia. But infections are cropping up worldwide, including in mainland Europe. The world faces a combination of factors including the climate crisis, increased migration and urbanisation, says Prof Sophie Yacoub, head of the dengue research group at Oxford University\u2019s clinical research unit in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The mosquito species that tends to carry dengue is Aedes aegypti, particularly in south-east Asia. But a second type can also spread the virus: Aedes albopictus \u2013 the tiger mosquito. It can survive in a greater range of temperatures, and has established itself in new areas. It is well adapted to urban settings and can breed in a tiny amount of standing water. \u201cThat is what is causing local transmission in Europe, for example, and it is also pushing up into China and into the southern states of America,\u201d says Yacoub. Changes in climate not only help the mosquitoes to survive in new areas, but may cause extreme weather events such as flooding, creating new breeding grounds. Heatwaves can speed up reproduction cycles. Dr Najmul Haider, a lecturer in epidemiology at Keele University, published a paper in September in the journal IJID Regions, an official journal of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, highlighting surging case numbers. He wanted, he says \u201cto raise an alert that this is an alarming number, and the number is increasing\u201d. It is also, he says, likely to be an underestimate: \u201cRemember, most of the dengue cases are asymptomatic or very mild, they don\u2019t go to the healthcare system, they are not diagnosed, so they remain unnoticed.\u201d Haider warns that a second infection could be riskier than the first. This is because dengue fever has four distinct versions, known as serotypes. Each interacts differently with antibodies in human blood. People develop immunity to the serotype they are first infected with. But during a subsequent infection, with a different serotype, the body may produce antibodies to the first serotype it encountered. Those bind to virus particles, but fail to neutralise them. Instead, they end up creating an extreme immune response, which can end in organ failure. Part of the reason for the rise in cases in Brazil is that all four serotypes appear to be circulating simultaneously for the first time, officials say. Haider said dengue\u2019s historically lower death rate than malaria, a disease spread by a different type of mosquito, had made it less of a priority \u2013 particularly in resource-limited countries. However, its fatality rate is starting to change, says Yacoub. \u201cA lot of people dismissed it as another viral illness \u2013 but actually we are seeing some higher mortality now. \u201cThere are similar risk factors to Covid-19 \u2013 so people with obesity, or diabetes, or other comorbidities have a higher risk of getting severe dengue and higher mortality. And I think as dengue is affecting many countries that have also increasing obesity or diabetes, these two pandemics are kind of colliding.\u201d In Vietnam, she says, \u201cwe are now seeing a lot of obesity in our teenage kids, and they\u2019re the ones who are coming in [for hospital treatment]\u201d. Clinical trials and vaccines There is no treatment for dengue, with hospital care typically supporting the body while it fights the infection. A trial of a promising antiviral being developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson was discontinued earlier this month. Yacoub\u2019s group is conducting trials to find out whether repurposed antivirals already in use for other infections may be effective against dengue, and others to see whether therapies that focus on altering patients\u2019 immune responses could help. She is hoping for results within the next few years. There are also efforts to set up a large global trial looking at multiple treatments simultaneously, akin to the Recovery trial that during Covid-19 established that cheap steroid dexamethasone could help patients. \u201cIt would just be a constantly recruiting platform trial across 10 different countries, with thousands of patients being enrolled,\u201d Yacoub says. \u201cThat kind of size trial is what we need to really generate that robust evidence.\u201d Two vaccines against dengue have made it to market but one, Dengvaxia, is only useful in people who have been previously infected \u2013 otherwise it can increase the risk of severe infection. This limits its usefulness, particularly for mass immunisation campaigns. The second, Qdenga, is seen as more promising and is being used in Brazil to bring cases under control in dengue hotspots.

      "body": "<p>I don\u2019t expect measured analysis from Suella Braverman, but even so I was taken aback this time last year when I heard that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/30/uk-ministers-cobra-meeting-terrorism-threat-israel-hamas-conflict-suella-braverman\">she had described</a> the Palestine solidarity demos as \u201chate marches\u201d. Earlier that week I had walked with my friends \u2013 some Jewish like me, some not \u2013 in a crowd of 500,000 others over Waterloo Bridge, and looked west down the Thames towards parliament, as a British Muslim girl of about eight years old led chants through a loudhailer: \u201cGaza, Gaza, don\u2019t you cry / We will never let you die.\u201d</p> <p>In many years of attending and reporting on protests, rallies, general strikes and riots, I have rarely experienced more orderly, peaceful, family-oriented mass gatherings than these demonstrations.</p> <p>And yet Braverman wasn\u2019t alone in her condemnation. As prime minister, Rishi Sunak warned that \u201cmob rule is replacing democratic rule\u201d, while Keir Starmer\u2019s office sternly instructed its MPs and council leaders they must not, \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d join the crowds calling for a ceasefire. In March this year, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/11/keir-starmer-urged-to-sack-extremism-adviser-over-alleged-conflicts-of-interest\">extremism adviser</a>\u201d John Woodcock, made the extraordinary proposal that MPs and councillors be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/03/ministers-consider-ban-mps-engaging-pro-palestine-climate-protesters\">banned from engaging</a> with the protest organisers. Here, contrary to my experience, and that of hundreds of thousands of other peaceful protesters, was a crowd \u2013 sorry, a \u201cmob\u201d \u2013 that the establishment designated it toxic to be a part of.</p> <p>I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, because our politics, media and pop culture have always been stacked with these myths \u2013 with people in power decrying mindless mobs, madding crowds, unthinking masses, stampeding hordes and herd mentalities. For our entire lives, we have been told that joining crowds robs us of our agency, our capacity for rational thought and our sense of self and propriety. Violence and moral turpitude spread like a contagion, overpowering every crowd member. In short, we become bestial.</p>    <p>Like the \u201cangry mob\u201d that appears in so many Simpsons episodes, pitchforks and flaming torches appear in our hands as if by magic \u2013 and, hypnotised and stripped of our individual humanity \u2013 we ask no questions, bay for blood, and walk in lockstep with the zombie horde. \u201cBy the mere fact that he forms part of an organised crowd,\u201d wrote the godfather of crowd theory, Gustave Le Bon, in 1895, \u201ca man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation. Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian.\u201d</p> <p>Le Bon\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crowd:_A_Study_of_the_Popular_Mind\">seminal work</a>, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, is one of the bestselling nonfiction books of all time; within a year of publication in France it was translated into 19 other languages. He acquired fans among presidents and dictators, police chiefs; even Sigmund Freud was an admirer. He is still regularly cited by columnists and politicians in 2024 to condemn the mania of the mob. But there are two problems with this pervasive received wisdom about crowd psychology and behaviour.</p> <p>The first problem \u2013 and it\u2019s quite a big one \u2013 is that the work is verifiably, scientifically, nonsense. Le Bon was an eccentric, war-traumatised eugenicist and proto-fascist, terrified by the growing demands of the French masses for democracy and socialism, and The Crowd<em> </em>is fuelled by fear and loathing, not research. It is no coincidence that it was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Le_Bon\">adopted</a> with enthusiasm by Goebbels, by Hitler (the academic Alfred Stein claims Hitler plagiarised parts of Le Bon\u2019s The Crowd<em> </em>in Mein Kampf), and by Mussolini, who liked his work so much he and Le Bon became pen pals. There is a direct line from traditional crowd theory to the glowering horror of the Nuremberg rallies.</p> <p>The second problem with the myths of mob mentality, homogeneous \u201cherd logic\u201d and contagious crowd violence is that they are incredibly persistent \u2013 in spite of being false \u2013 because defaming the crowd will always serve elite power and undermine democracy. Not for nothing was the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst dubbed \u201cthe queen of the mob\u201d by her opponents. Presenting any self-assembling group of people as both homogeneous and dangerous is as old as hierarchical power itself. After all, what is a mob? There is nothing categorically distinctive or analytically precise about it: a mob is simply a crowd you don\u2019t like.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/20/un-special-rapporteur-lse-london-school-economics-pro-palestine-demonstration\">UN rapporteur challenges LSE over action against pro-Palestine protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fortunately, a new generation of crowd psychologists are developing fresh ideas. Detailed case studies conducted by academics such as Stephen Reicher and Clifford Stott have proved what many of us know instinctively: that joining a crowd of like-minded souls brings us kinship, confidence, and joy \u2013 and that every crowd contains a multitude of behaviours and psychological responses. Reicher uncovered what might be an unpalatable truth in his seminal study of the \u201criot\u201d in St Paul\u2019s, Bristol, in 1980: that joy, warmth and solidarity are often experienced even while cars are being set alight. Far from erasing our sense of self, coming together with fellow football fans, music fans, or people with the same political or religious affiliations, is greatly affirming. How else do you explain, for instance, moshpits? To most gig- goers, they look like deranged masochism and a short cut to a broken ankle; to participants, they are electrifying, life-affirming moments of collective joy \u2013 that only bring joy because of the grinning strangers moshing alongside you.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean all crowds are forces for good, of course. While my reporting has taken me to inspiring political protests, hedonistic global carnivals and other festivals in the name of journalism, I have also borne witness to sinister crowds, such as the <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2013/07/09/banning-hungarian-far-right-group-was-legal-says-echr\">fascist paramilitaries</a> of the Magyar G\u00e1rda in Budapest and a proto-Trump Tea Party rally in White Plains, New York; I have even been to watch Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Watching with horror the racist riots in August this year, I was unsurprised that many anti-racists opted for the classic Le Bonian interpretation: here is the deranged, brainless violence of the mob. But it does nothing to strengthen the cause of anti-racism to apply the same baseless analysis to crowds we dislike. When you call a violent fascist \u201cbrainless\u201d, you are not just skipping a much-needed reckoning with their hateful ideology, you are also letting them off the hook for their conscious decisions and actions.</p> <p>Were the rioters who tried to burn people alive in a hotel in Rotherham mere passersby, who suddenly \u201clost their heads\u201d, succumbed to \u201cherd mentality\u201d and were \u201cswept away by the crowd\u201d? Or were they a group of largely organised and experienced fascists with a clear plan to intimidate or even murder Muslims, refugees and other migrants? Politicians prefer to dismiss riots as mob madness because a deeper investigation of their causes can provide undesirable answers \u2013 for example, it might connect a group of violent racists chanting \u201cstop the boats\u201d to a political class who had been declaiming the exact same words in an election campaign only a few weeks earlier.</p> <p>When those in power speak about a crowd, it is always a calculated attempt to diminish the multilayered varieties of intent, behaviour and personality of its members.

      "bodyText": "I don\u2019t expect measured analysis from Suella Braverman, but even so I was taken aback this time last year when I heard that she had described the Palestine solidarity demos as \u201chate marches\u201d. Earlier that week I had walked with my friends \u2013 some Jewish like me, some not \u2013 in a crowd of 500,000 others over Waterloo Bridge, and looked west down the Thames towards parliament, as a British Muslim girl of about eight years old led chants through a loudhailer: \u201cGaza, Gaza, don\u2019t you cry / We will never let you die.\u201d In many years of attending and reporting on protests, rallies, general strikes and riots, I have rarely experienced more orderly, peaceful, family-oriented mass gatherings than these demonstrations. And yet Braverman wasn\u2019t alone in her condemnation. As prime minister, Rishi Sunak warned that \u201cmob rule is replacing democratic rule\u201d, while Keir Starmer\u2019s office sternly instructed its MPs and council leaders they must not, \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d join the crowds calling for a ceasefire. In March this year, the \u201cextremism adviser\u201d John Woodcock, made the extraordinary proposal that MPs and councillors be banned from engaging with the protest organisers. Here, contrary to my experience, and that of hundreds of thousands of other peaceful protesters, was a crowd \u2013 sorry, a \u201cmob\u201d \u2013 that the establishment designated it toxic to be a part of. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, because our politics, media and pop culture have always been stacked with these myths \u2013 with people in power decrying mindless mobs, madding crowds, unthinking masses, stampeding hordes and herd mentalities. For our entire lives, we have been told that joining crowds robs us of our agency, our capacity for rational thought and our sense of self and propriety. Violence and moral turpitude spread like a contagion, overpowering every crowd member. In short, we become bestial. Like the \u201cangry mob\u201d that appears in so many Simpsons episodes, pitchforks and flaming torches appear in our hands as if by magic \u2013 and, hypnotised and stripped of our individual humanity \u2013 we ask no questions, bay for blood, and walk in lockstep with the zombie horde. \u201cBy the mere fact that he forms part of an organised crowd,\u201d wrote the godfather of crowd theory, Gustave Le Bon, in 1895, \u201ca man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation. Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian.\u201d Le Bon\u2019s seminal work, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, is one of the bestselling nonfiction books of all time; within a year of publication in France it was translated into 19 other languages. He acquired fans among presidents and dictators, police chiefs; even Sigmund Freud was an admirer. He is still regularly cited by columnists and politicians in 2024 to condemn the mania of the mob. But there are two problems with this pervasive received wisdom about crowd psychology and behaviour. The first problem \u2013 and it\u2019s quite a big one \u2013 is that the work is verifiably, scientifically, nonsense. Le Bon was an eccentric, war-traumatised eugenicist and proto-fascist, terrified by the growing demands of the French masses for democracy and socialism, and The Crowd is fuelled by fear and loathing, not research. It is no coincidence that it was adopted with enthusiasm by Goebbels, by Hitler (the academic Alfred Stein claims Hitler plagiarised parts of Le Bon\u2019s The Crowd in Mein Kampf), and by Mussolini, who liked his work so much he and Le Bon became pen pals. There is a direct line from traditional crowd theory to the glowering horror of the Nuremberg rallies. The second problem with the myths of mob mentality, homogeneous \u201cherd logic\u201d and contagious crowd violence is that they are incredibly persistent \u2013 in spite of being false \u2013 because defaming the crowd will always serve elite power and undermine democracy. Not for nothing was the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst dubbed \u201cthe queen of the mob\u201d by her opponents. Presenting any self-assembling group of people as both homogeneous and dangerous is as old as hierarchical power itself. After all, what is a mob? There is nothing categorically distinctive or analytically precise about it: a mob is simply a crowd you don\u2019t like. Fortunately, a new generation of crowd psychologists are developing fresh ideas. Detailed case studies conducted by academics such as Stephen Reicher and Clifford Stott have proved what many of us know instinctively: that joining a crowd of like-minded souls brings us kinship, confidence, and joy \u2013 and that every crowd contains a multitude of behaviours and psychological responses. Reicher uncovered what might be an unpalatable truth in his seminal study of the \u201criot\u201d in St Paul\u2019s, Bristol, in 1980: that joy, warmth and solidarity are often experienced even while cars are being set alight. Far from erasing our sense of self, coming together with fellow football fans, music fans, or people with the same political or religious affiliations, is greatly affirming. How else do you explain, for instance, moshpits? To most gig- goers, they look like deranged masochism and a short cut to a broken ankle; to participants, they are electrifying, life-affirming moments of collective joy \u2013 that only bring joy because of the grinning strangers moshing alongside you. This doesn\u2019t mean all crowds are forces for good, of course. While my reporting has taken me to inspiring political protests, hedonistic global carnivals and other festivals in the name of journalism, I have also borne witness to sinister crowds, such as the fascist paramilitaries of the Magyar G\u00e1rda in Budapest and a proto-Trump Tea Party rally in White Plains, New York; I have even been to watch Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Watching with horror the racist riots in August this year, I was unsurprised that many anti-racists opted for the classic Le Bonian interpretation: here is the deranged, brainless violence of the mob. But it does nothing to strengthen the cause of anti-racism to apply the same baseless analysis to crowds we dislike. When you call a violent fascist \u201cbrainless\u201d, you are not just skipping a much-needed reckoning with their hateful ideology, you are also letting them off the hook for their conscious decisions and actions. Were the rioters who tried to burn people alive in a hotel in Rotherham mere passersby, who suddenly \u201clost their heads\u201d, succumbed to \u201cherd mentality\u201d and were \u201cswept away by the crowd\u201d? Or were they a group of largely organised and experienced fascists with a clear plan to intimidate or even murder Muslims, refugees and other migrants? Politicians prefer to dismiss riots as mob madness because a deeper investigation of their causes can provide undesirable answers \u2013 for example, it might connect a group of violent racists chanting \u201cstop the boats\u201d to a political class who had been declaiming the exact same words in an election campaign only a few weeks earlier. When those in power speak about a crowd, it is always a calculated attempt to diminish the multilayered varieties of intent, behaviour and personality of its members. Le Bon\u2019s fantastical crowd theories have persisted as the default position for 130 years because they serve a purpose as old as the crowd itself. That purpose is very simple: to shore up the powerful and delegitimise the public. If we want to refresh our democracy, our culture and our civil society, the best place to start would be by paying some overdue respect to the complex powers of the crowd.

      "body": "<p>For the past 12 years, on one long spring weekend, the population of Chipping Norton would swell, the area\u2019s hotels and B&amp;Bs, taxis, pubs and cafes busied by the arrival of authors, publishers, agents and publicists. Writers made visits to local schools. Audience members puttered between the theatre and the town hall, the library, the bookshop and the Methodist church.</p> <p>The decision to end ChipLitFest, the town\u2019s annual literary festival, was announced last week. It was a lack of \u201cconfidence at this point in the year that we\u2019ve got the resources to meet the cost of production,\u201d its director, Jenny Dee, told the Bookseller. And then there was the fact that publishers were beginning to question the wisdom of even sending their authors to such small festivals. That Chipping Norton\u2019s largest venue had a capacity of just 220 meant there was a limit to the money anyone could expect to make.</p> <p>Since the launch of Cheltenham literature festival 75 years ago, the idea of the book festival has been embedded in the British cultural landscape. Its calendar runs, roughly, from Faversham in February, to Folkestone in November. It encompasses small-town gatherings and huge, corporate-sponsored events, with programmes that range from new poets to prize-winning novelists, via TV chefs and podcast hosts.</p> <p>In recent years, that idea has begun to shift \u2013 the broader spoken-word scene has grown more polished, authors and audiences more diverse, and events both more technologically involved and more socially conscious. Morning yoga and creative-writing workshops have been added to festival bills. Outreach programmes have been extended into local communities, and livestreams have introduced far-flung online audiences. In many ways, the value of such events is more evident than ever.</p> <p>But alongside these developments have come a number of financial constraints, of the kind that felled ChipLit. The basic costs of running a festival \u2013 energy, accommodation, transportation, administration and advertising \u2013 have all risen sharply, while potential audiences have less disposable income. Festival organisers have been faced with the conundrum of how to keep afloat \u2013 programming celebrity speakers at the expense of emerging literary talent, for example, raising ticket prices or seeking corporate sponsorship.</p> <p>Each apparent solution brings consequences, disrupting the delicate ecosystem of the book festival. Sponsorship, in particular, is in short supply and not without ramification. This year came the news that the investment management company Baillie Gifford would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/06/baillie-gifford-cancels-all-remaining-sponsorships-of-literary-festivals\">ending its sponsorship</a> of nine British book festivals, including Hay, Edinburgh and Cheltenham, following a campaign by Fossil Free Books (FFB) that was widely supported by authors. In May, 200 of them, including Sally Rooney, Naomi Klein and Max Porter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/15/authors-baillie-gifford-fossil-fuel\">signed an FFB statement</a> demanding that Baillie Gifford divest from companies involved in the fossil fuel industry and those with links to the Israeli state.</p>    <p>The situation has now grown critical enough that the recent Ilkley literature festival programmed an \u201cindustry insight event\u201d on the \u201cpresent and future of literature festivals and the UK\u2019s literary ecology\u201d, which looked at the many challenges currently facing the industry.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if there has been a misunderstanding about the power balance in the relationship between a festival and its corporate sponsor,\u201d Ilkley festival\u2019s director, Erica Morris, says of the Baillie Gifford controversy. \u201cBut the people who\u2019ve lost out have been literature festivals and writers.\u201d</p> <p>From the perspective of the publishing industry, the appeal of the book festival is a simple one: to sell more books. A festival\u2019s impact, however, is not always a simple thing to quantify. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to send people up and down the country, so you have to measure whether it\u2019s worthwhile,\u201d says Millie Seaward, head of publicity at Dialogue Books. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to measure the long tail of these things.\u201d</p> <p>The obvious yardstick is sales through the festival bookshop, but even those figures can be blurry. \u201cPeople will go to a few events at a festival,\u201d Seaward says. \u201cEach ticket will cost, say, \u00a37 to \u00a320. If they\u2019re going to a number of events someone might not buy the book on the day. But they might pre-order the paperback, or buy the audiobook, or go on Amazon after the festival.\u201d She points out that if a festival has a media sponsor, they might also be minded to support an author\u2019s work and provide coverage in the future \u2013 leading to further sales.</p> <p>It can be a tough call to make. Book festival appearances are not especially lucrative for authors. Many can expect a speaking fee of \u00a3150, with few book sales at the event, for which they may have taken time off work, or travelled great distances. Still, Seaward sees a value that extends beyond pure economics. \u201cOne of the reasons I wanted to do this job is because I love festivals,\u201d she says. \u201cThey offer such a great space for discussion and bringing authors into public consciousness.\u201d</p> <p>The history of those who have set up and programmed book festivals is pleasingly eclectic. \u201cIt sounds daft in hindsight, but I\u2019d never properly been to a literary festival before I set up mine,\u201d says Liz Vater, founder and director of Stoke Newington literary festival in north London. \u201cI\u2019ve been a ferocious reader all my life, but I felt excluded from the literary scene. Fifteen years ago, most festivals felt as though they were organised by formidable committees of people who were still very proud of having read English literature at Cambridge. I had a BSc in geography from Swansea, so felt like a fish out of water.\u201d</p> <p>It was only when Vater\u2019s husband, the author Pete Brown, did his first festival event that a thought occurred to her: \u201cWhy on earth isn\u2019t there a better version of this in Stoke Newington, which has a rich literary and radical history?\u201d She paid for the first festival on her credit card, and her 27 acts included Tony Benn, Shappi Khorsandi, AC Grayling and Stewart Lee reading a ghost story in an old garment warehouse.</p> <p>Today, the festival has an established partnership with the publisher Picador, but remains volunteer-run. \u201cWe have no large salary bills to foot, so it was an easier decision to eschew corporate sponsorship, which wouldn\u2019t fit with our ethos anyway,\u201d Vater says.</p> <p>That ethos might be described as a desire to \u201cshake things up a bit\u201d. \u201cSometimes it feels as though literary festivals are talking to the same people over and over again: affluent, middle-class people who love \u2018literature\u2019 and feel very at home amongst people like themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Stoke Newington\u2019s audience is younger, more diverse and with a more equal gender split than most other festivals, facts Vater attributes to its affordability \u2013 the average price of event tickets is about \u00a37 \u2013 and to its programming. \u201cThis year we put a superb project by Speaking Volumes \u2013 about older women\u2019s voices \u2013 front and centre at our main opening gala night,\u201d she says. \u201cTen years ago we\u2019d have played it safe and put a big headliner there, but our audience is happy to give new things a chance.\u201d</p> <p>Festivals can be mixed experiences for writers. Some way into her writing career, Melissa Harrison arrived at a well-known book festival. She had spoken at the event before, and was happy to return. This time, however, she learned the organisers had arranged for a local radio DJ to host some of the spoken-word events. Harrison\u2019s work ranges from novels to children\u2019s books, but she was at the festival to discuss her nature writing, and the radio DJ, seemingly confounded by the subject, sought to enliven proceedings.</p>    <p>\u201cHe came on stage, and he\u2019d draped himself with garlands and plastic birds, and he draped me with garlands and plastic birds,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he had prepared a birdsong identification quiz for me live on stage with no warning.\u201d The songs he played did not belong to British birds, and Harrison floundered. \u201cI came off stage feeling incredibly humiliated.\u201d</p> <p>The incident is one of many \u2013 good and bad \u2013 that Harrison can list from across more than a decade of promoting her work at book festivals. For every galvanising discussion or heartening encounter with a reader, there have been strange pairings with other authors, hosts who clearly have not read her work, a general lack of organisation or food, or a failure to pay.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be a lovely experience that\u2019s incredibly rewarding, and inspiring, and sends you away on top of the world. Or you could end up feeling incredibly small. A lot of the time I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m there for, or what people want from me.\u201d</p> <p>For Tomiwa Owolade, the experience is still quite new. He began promoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/26/this-is-not-america-by-tomiwa-owolade-review-why-black-lives-in-britain-matter\">his first book, This Is Not America</a>, in June 2023, and is still being booked for live events. \u201cIt feels never-ending,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\u201d It has taken him from Cliveden, with its glamorous authors\u2019 dinner and a night in a four-poster bed, to a recent trip to Berwick, for which he rose at 6am and returned home to London after midnight.</p> <p>By and large he has found the experience \u201cpositive, flattering\u201d, he says. \u201cSome authors are more focused on the work and hate doing publicity. Some authors love the glamorous side, they derive great satisfaction from it. I love it. I love experiencing the very small sliver of recognition.\u201d</p> <p>For Harrison, live events can feel more exposing. \u201cMost authors are introverts and don\u2019t always enjoy being on stage and being public and having to be quite \u2018on\u2019 in that way,\u201d she says. </p> <p>She often finds herself wondering why people choose to attend. \u201cThere\u2019s someone sitting on a stage having a conversation with someone else, and you\u2019ve paid 10 quid or something. And often I don\u2019t feel that much has been imparted worth the entrance fee.\u201d Her response has been to \u201ctry to do a bit more\u201d \u2013 memorising a section of the book to deliver without notes, for instance. \u201cBecause I think you should show the effort that you\u2019ve made, and perhaps turn it into some kind of performance or event.\u201d</p>    <p>Despite differing approaches, both authors have often found encountering their readership complicated. Both mention a certain aggression. \u201cWhat I find interesting is the people who ask really hostile questions,\u201d Owolade says. \u201cI think: \u2018Well, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s paid to be here.\u2019\u201d Harrison describes \u201ca contingent of people who come because they want to be a writer and they want to know what the secret is\u201d. Their tone can be \u201cvery slightly aggressive\u201d, she says. \u201cWhat they want is you to tell them what they will need to know \u2013 the thing that will unlock a different life for them. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s a secret and you\u2019re holding on to it, you\u2019re gatekeeping.\u201d</p> <p>Still, she sees something reassuring in the fact that people still choose to buy books at all. \u201cI think people want to have contact with a culture that matters to them,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cIt reassures you that it\u2019s still there and it\u2019s still real. These are real people, and you can take away a real book with their name in it. And perhaps in a world where everything is becoming quite virtual and untrustworthy and AI-driven, there\u2019s something in that actual physical contact.\u201d</p> <p>For many, the space created by the Baillie Gifford exit has seemed daunting; Hay\u2019s chief executive, Julie Finch, spoke of the \u201cpossible decimation of the festival\u201d after losing half a million pounds, and the hunt for deep-yet-ethical pockets continues. For others, the sponsorship vacancy has offered an opportunity. This month, it was announced that the Fane Group would be the new sponsors of Henley literary festival. Since launching in 2017, Fane has come to dominate the world of spoken-word event production. The company operates internationally and online, and has programmed tours and standalone events for authors such as Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Day and Miriam Margolyes.</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate where we stand within the wider ecosystem of the bookselling community,\u201d the company\u2019s founder, Alex Fane, says via email. \u201cWhen I read about all the Baille Gifford developments, I sensed an opportunity to strengthen our support through a festival partnership.\u201d He is adamant that the nature of Henley will not change. \u201cNor will its programming.\u201d</p> <p>The rise of the glamorous new spoken-word scene \u2013 of the kind exemplified by Fane\u2019s productions \u2013 should not be regarded as a threat to the longstanding book festival tradition. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that there is space for every type of event and that healthy competition increases the opportunities for all,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course there is some overlap, but in general we must all be behind increasing the reach of the literary world.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, the moment has prompted many organisers to contemplate the role of individual festivals, and how they cater to their specific communities. In Durham, the director of the city\u2019s book festival, Rebecca Wilkie, cites this year\u2019s celebration of Pat Barker as an example of the kind of event that is possible with a festival\u2019s marriage of geography and passion.</p> <p>\u201cIn the queue afterwards there were lots of people of all ages coming up to her saying: \u2018Until I read you, I didn\u2019t know you could be a writer if you came from Teesside,\u2019\u201d she says. Other events included a discussion of regional devolution, and creative writing workshops. \u201cIt felt like a brilliant north-east celebration.\u201d</p> <p>In Ilkley, Erica Morris and her team have been focusing on \u201chyperlocal\u201d community projects as part of the festival\u2019s Word Up North programme, but also on rethinking how festivals can play a role in broader conversations \u2013 including the issues raised by the Baillie Gifford controversy. \u201cI think people feel more empowered to speak up for the issues they care about,\u201d Morris says. \u201cAnd I think literary festivals are places that should be part of that discussion.</p> <p>\u201cSome people see us as gatekeepers, that we are more powerful and richer than we are, or that we are purveyors of culture,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not. We can provide platforms for discussion and debate and different points of view, and try and be better ourselves. We can be part of the change.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "For the past 12 years, on one long spring weekend, the population of Chipping Norton would swell, the area\u2019s hotels and B&amp;Bs, taxis, pubs and cafes busied by the arrival of authors, publishers, agents and publicists. Writers made visits to local schools. Audience members puttered between the theatre and the town hall, the library, the bookshop and the Methodist church. The decision to end ChipLitFest, the town\u2019s annual literary festival, was announced last week. It was a lack of \u201cconfidence at this point in the year that we\u2019ve got the resources to meet the cost of production,\u201d its director, Jenny Dee, told the Bookseller. And then there was the fact that publishers were beginning to question the wisdom of even sending their authors to such small festivals. That Chipping Norton\u2019s largest venue had a capacity of just 220 meant there was a limit to the money anyone could expect to make. Since the launch of Cheltenham literature festival 75 years ago, the idea of the book festival has been embedded in the British cultural landscape. Its calendar runs, roughly, from Faversham in February, to Folkestone in November. It encompasses small-town gatherings and huge, corporate-sponsored events, with programmes that range from new poets to prize-winning novelists, via TV chefs and podcast hosts. In recent years, that idea has begun to shift \u2013 the broader spoken-word scene has grown more polished, authors and audiences more diverse, and events both more technologically involved and more socially conscious. Morning yoga and creative-writing workshops have been added to festival bills. Outreach programmes have been extended into local communities, and livestreams have introduced far-flung online audiences. In many ways, the value of such events is more evident than ever. But alongside these developments have come a number of financial constraints, of the kind that felled ChipLit. The basic costs of running a festival \u2013 energy, accommodation, transportation, administration and advertising \u2013 have all risen sharply, while potential audiences have less disposable income. Festival organisers have been faced with the conundrum of how to keep afloat \u2013 programming celebrity speakers at the expense of emerging literary talent, for example, raising ticket prices or seeking corporate sponsorship. Each apparent solution brings consequences, disrupting the delicate ecosystem of the book festival. Sponsorship, in particular, is in short supply and not without ramification. This year came the news that the investment management company Baillie Gifford would be ending its sponsorship of nine British book festivals, including Hay, Edinburgh and Cheltenham, following a campaign by Fossil Free Books (FFB) that was widely supported by authors. In May, 200 of them, including Sally Rooney, Naomi Klein and Max Porter, signed an FFB statement demanding that Baillie Gifford divest from companies involved in the fossil fuel industry and those with links to the Israeli state. The situation has now grown critical enough that the recent Ilkley literature festival programmed an \u201cindustry insight event\u201d on the \u201cpresent and future of literature festivals and the UK\u2019s literary ecology\u201d, which looked at the many challenges currently facing the industry. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there has been a misunderstanding about the power balance in the relationship between a festival and its corporate sponsor,\u201d Ilkley festival\u2019s director, Erica Morris, says of the Baillie Gifford controversy. \u201cBut the people who\u2019ve lost out have been literature festivals and writers.\u201d From the perspective of the publishing industry, the appeal of the book festival is a simple one: to sell more books. A festival\u2019s impact, however, is not always a simple thing to quantify. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to send people up and down the country, so you have to measure whether it\u2019s worthwhile,\u201d says Millie Seaward, head of publicity at Dialogue Books. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to measure the long tail of these things.\u201d The obvious yardstick is sales through the festival bookshop, but even those figures can be blurry. \u201cPeople will go to a few events at a festival,\u201d Seaward says. \u201cEach ticket will cost, say, \u00a37 to \u00a320. If they\u2019re going to a number of events someone might not buy the book on the day. But they might pre-order the paperback, or buy the audiobook, or go on Amazon after the festival.\u201d She points out that if a festival has a media sponsor, they might also be minded to support an author\u2019s work and provide coverage in the future \u2013 leading to further sales. It can be a tough call to make. Book festival appearances are not especially lucrative for authors. Many can expect a speaking fee of \u00a3150, with few book sales at the event, for which they may have taken time off work, or travelled great distances. Still, Seaward sees a value that extends beyond pure economics. \u201cOne of the reasons I wanted to do this job is because I love festivals,\u201d she says. \u201cThey offer such a great space for discussion and bringing authors into public consciousness.\u201d The history of those who have set up and programmed book festivals is pleasingly eclectic. \u201cIt sounds daft in hindsight, but I\u2019d never properly been to a literary festival before I set up mine,\u201d says Liz Vater, founder and director of Stoke Newington literary festival in north London. \u201cI\u2019ve been a ferocious reader all my life, but I felt excluded from the literary scene. Fifteen years ago, most festivals felt as though they were organised by formidable committees of people who were still very proud of having read English literature at Cambridge. I had a BSc in geography from Swansea, so felt like a fish out of water.\u201d It was only when Vater\u2019s husband, the author Pete Brown, did his first festival event that a thought occurred to her: \u201cWhy on earth isn\u2019t there a better version of this in Stoke Newington, which has a rich literary and radical history?\u201d She paid for the first festival on her credit card, and her 27 acts included Tony Benn, Shappi Khorsandi, AC Grayling and Stewart Lee reading a ghost story in an old garment warehouse. Today, the festival has an established partnership with the publisher Picador, but remains volunteer-run. \u201cWe have no large salary bills to foot, so it was an easier decision to eschew corporate sponsorship, which wouldn\u2019t fit with our ethos anyway,\u201d Vater says. That ethos might be described as a desire to \u201cshake things up a bit\u201d. \u201cSometimes it feels as though literary festivals are talking to the same people over and over again: affluent, middle-class people who love \u2018literature\u2019 and feel very at home amongst people like themselves.\u201d Stoke Newington\u2019s audience is younger, more diverse and with a more equal gender split than most other festivals, facts Vater attributes to its affordability \u2013 the average price of event tickets is about \u00a37 \u2013 and to its programming. \u201cThis year we put a superb project by Speaking Volumes \u2013 about older women\u2019s voices \u2013 front and centre at our main opening gala night,\u201d she says. \u201cTen years ago we\u2019d have played it safe and put a big headliner there, but our audience is happy to give new things a chance.\u201d Festivals can be mixed experiences for writers. Some way into her writing career, Melissa Harrison arrived at a well-known book festival. She had spoken at the event before, and was happy to return. This time, however, she learned the organisers had arranged for a local radio DJ to host some of the spoken-word events. Harrison\u2019s work ranges from novels to children\u2019s books, but she was at the festival to discuss her nature writing, and the radio DJ, seemingly confounded by the subject, sought to enliven proceedings. \u201cHe came on stage, and he\u2019d draped himself with garlands and plastic birds, and he draped me with garlands and plastic birds,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he had prepared a birdsong identification quiz for me live on stage with no warning.\u201d The songs he played did not belong to British birds, and Harrison floundered. \u201cI came off stage feeling incredibly humiliated.\u201d The incident is one of many \u2013 good and bad \u2013 that Harrison can list from across more than a decade of promoting her work at book festivals. For every galvanising discussion or heartening encounter with a reader, there have been strange pairings with other authors, hosts who clearly have not read her work, a general lack of organisation or food, or a failure to pay. \u201cIt could be a lovely experience that\u2019s incredibly rewarding, and inspiring, and sends you away on top of the world. Or you could end up feeling incredibly small. A lot of the time I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m there for, or what people want from me.\u201d For Tomiwa Owolade, the experience is still quite new. He began promoting his first book, This Is Not America, in June 2023, and is still being booked for live events. \u201cIt feels never-ending,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\u201d It has taken him from Cliveden, with its glamorous authors\u2019 dinner and a night in a four-poster bed, to a recent trip to Berwick, for which he rose at 6am and returned home to London after midnight. By and large he has found the experience \u201cpositive, flattering\u201d, he says. \u201cSome authors are more focused on the work and hate doing publicity. Some authors love the glamorous side, they derive great satisfaction from it. I love it. I love experiencing the very small sliver of recognition.\u201d For Harrison, live events can feel more exposing. \u201cMost authors are introverts and don\u2019t always enjoy being on stage and being public and having to be quite \u2018on\u2019 in that way,\u201d she says. She often finds herself wondering why people choose to attend. \u201cThere\u2019s someone sitting on a stage having a conversation with someone else, and you\u2019ve paid 10 quid or something. And often I don\u2019t feel that much has been imparted worth the entrance fee.\u201d Her response has been to \u201ctry to do a bit more\u201d \u2013 memorising a section of the book to deliver without notes, for instance. \u201cBecause I think you should show the effort that you\u2019ve made, and perhaps turn it into some kind of performance or event.\u201d Despite differing approaches, both authors have often found encountering their readership complicated. Both mention a certain aggression. \u201cWhat I find interesting is the people who ask really hostile questions,\u201d Owolade says. \u201cI think: \u2018Well, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s paid to be here.\u2019\u201d Harrison describes \u201ca contingent of people who come because they want to be a writer and they want to know what the secret is\u201d. Their tone can be \u201cvery slightly aggressive\u201d, she says. \u201cWhat they want is you to tell them what they will need to know \u2013 the thing that will unlock a different life for them. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s a secret and you\u2019re holding on to it, you\u2019re gatekeeping.\u201d Still, she sees something reassuring in the fact that people still choose to buy books at all. \u201cI think people want to have contact with a culture that matters to them,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cIt reassures you that it\u2019s still there and it\u2019s still real. These are real people, and you can take away a real book with their name in it. And perhaps in a world where everything is becoming quite virtual and untrustworthy and AI-driven, there\u2019s something in that actual physical contact.\u201d For many, the space created by the Baillie Gifford exit has seemed daunting; Hay\u2019s chief executive, Julie Finch, spoke of the \u201cpossible decimation of the festival\u201d after losing half a million pounds, and the hunt for deep-yet-ethical pockets continues. For others, the sponsorship vacancy has offered an opportunity. This month, it was announced that the Fane Group would be the new sponsors of Henley literary festival. Since launching in 2017, Fane has come to dominate the world of spoken-word event production. The company operates internationally and online, and has programmed tours and standalone events for authors such as Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Day and Miriam Margolyes. \u201cWe appreciate where we stand within the wider ecosystem of the bookselling community,\u201d the company\u2019s founder, Alex Fane, says via email. \u201cWhen I read about all the Baille Gifford developments, I sensed an opportunity to strengthen our support through a festival partnership.\u201d He is adamant that the nature of Henley will not change. \u201cNor will its programming.\u201d The rise of the glamorous new spoken-word scene \u2013 of the kind exemplified by Fane\u2019s productions \u2013 should not be regarded as a threat to the longstanding book festival tradition. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that there is space for every type of event and that healthy competition increases the opportunities for all,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course there is some overlap, but in general we must all be behind increasing the reach of the literary world.\u201d Elsewhere, the moment has prompted many organisers to contemplate the role of individual festivals, and how they cater to their specific communities. In Durham, the director of the city\u2019s book festival, Rebecca Wilkie, cites this year\u2019s celebration of Pat Barker as an example of the kind of event that is possible with a festival\u2019s marriage of geography and passion. \u201cIn the queue afterwards there were lots of people of all ages coming up to her saying: \u2018Until I read you, I didn\u2019t know you could be a writer if you came from Teesside,\u2019\u201d she says. Other events included a discussion of regional devolution, and creative writing workshops. \u201cIt felt like a brilliant north-east celebration.\u201d In Ilkley, Erica Morris and her team have been focusing on \u201chyperlocal\u201d community projects as part of the festival\u2019s Word Up North programme, but also on rethinking how festivals can play a role in broader conversations \u2013 including the issues raised by the Baillie Gifford controversy. \u201cI think people feel more empowered to speak up for the issues they care about,\u201d Morris says. \u201cAnd I think literary festivals are places that should be part of that discussion. \u201cSome people see us as gatekeepers, that we are more powerful and richer than we are, or that we are purveyors of culture,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not. We can provide platforms for discussion and debate and different points of view, and try and be better ourselves. We can be part of the change.\u201d \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "body": "<p>Micheal Ray Richardson was a brilliant player: a four-time NBA All-Star guard. He was also the first player banned for life by the league for drug use, something which was far more common during his playing days. Back in the 1980s, substances like cocaine were not only part of professional sports but also <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/casual-cocaine-ads-show-lit-034207924.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHMFIIC0I8gRIjyL5Ph-tiwdxeSMiSc1V0Fv4xwrr9QNyjpRhZ4mLAej3B3Y4sfhnjBFzxcfzMnY9IEOPlR4V-CQpIEt3kViJFKF_2-_lXbrkS5m0nJZph6h3XPuM7wwtnmWFhCsFStqxjzNIeIDu3IfXdSJzRH7eabvm1XZuj65\">society and</a> <a href=\"https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/this-bill-murray-movie-was-a-permanent-cocaine-party/\">entertainment at large</a>, and Richardson says talk about drugs was routine during what some still call the NBA\u2019s cocaine era. \u201cDuring warmups,\u201d Richardson says, \u201cguys on different teams would say, \u2018Yo, man, I got what you\u2019re looking for. Let\u2019s get together when [the game] is over.\u2019 And <em>boom</em> that\u2019s how it got going.\u201d </p> <p>At the time, drugs were \u201ceverywhere \u2013 it was like a fad,\u201d says Richardson, who also goes by the nickname Sugar. But in the NBA, it alienated many fans. So much so that to correct the problem, the NBA instituted a three-strike system, which led to Richardson\u2019s 1986 banishment (all of which he discusses in his <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Banned-Squandered-All-Star-Finding-Redemption/dp/1683584902\">forthcoming memoir</a>, <a href=\"https://hoopshype.com/2024/09/19/banned-how-i-squandered-an-all-star-nba-career-before-finding-my-redemption/\">Banned</a>). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/22/nba-season-predictions-preview-picks-standings\">NBA 2024-25 predictions: Luka for MVP? And will the Knicks win it all?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, aside from the 10ft basket and the five-on-five competition, the NBA does not resemble the league in the late 1970s and early 1980s. But when it comes to drugs, that change took time. For Richardson, who grew up modestly in the midwest and only got into drugs after succumbing to peer pressure while living in New York City and playing for the Knicks, drugs were not a part of his early life. Then they overtook him and led to a debilitating years-long addiction. But his story is far from unique. When David Stern took over as commissioner of the NBA in 1984, one of his top priorities, along with promoting the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry, was cleaning up the game. That meant suspensions and lifetime bans (Richardson was also the first player reinstated to the NBA, in 1988, but he never returned to the league).</p> <p>Still, pro basketball in those days was littered with addiction and lost potential. Marvin \u201cBad News\u201d Barnes is perhaps the poster child for drug issues. His biography, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bad-News-Turbulent-Basketballs-Original/dp/1683582675/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2X7JD0W75AM82&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9xcKMDEHBV6wMLdwH0w53RPhkgZE3PSZcn4ALMVySrOdjBLSGLfRv9XbdZeZsg4oP4cQT3uthlPIYg0G0_RdwYMP1k9zYkmNVFGz60Hkau54EJCmip34_rmQL41K14EvOvNmpnWWsltbaiC-PEWqPg9H5taZs-kqmVChnBNtHJSM866lIYyD5FIfxjVeiYprlVdBAGTmf1IuCtHRn6QG-7IVyTBMY5ssdyrynXqaYlo.bfoB_qbjJ5JgbBpGfjJNqInB6rbwUtUR81QQ1CCNC3A&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=bad+news+barnes+book&amp;qid=1728504234&amp;sprefix=bad+news+barnes+boo%2Caps%2C153&amp;sr=8-1\">Bad News</a>, details a life of <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/1990/03/04/bad-news-is-back-behind-bars/\">drug abuse</a>, which included hanging out with drug kingpins, derailing what could have been a Hall of Fame career. He went from averaging 24.1 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in 1975-76 in the ABA to 9.6 and 4.8 a season later in the NBA. Barnes was out of pro hoops by 1980 and, despite trying many times, never kicked his habit before passing away in 2014. But Barnes, too, is not an isolated case. In 1986, the same year Richardson was banned for life, Boston Celtics rookie Len Bias, died from a drug overdose at the age of 22 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/basketball/65953921\">mere hours after being drafted</a>. \u201cHe got ahold of some bad stuff,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cThat was a sad moment. A wakeup call for everybody.\u201d</p>    <p>Also in 1986, All-Star John Drew was banned for life for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy. That same year, Rockets guard John Lucas was waived by the team because his drug issues <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-11-23-sp-12376-story.html\">had become so bad</a>. (Lucas later turned his life around, became an NBA coach, <a href=\"https://johnlucasenterprises.com/athlete-aftercare\">founded a rehabilitation center</a>, which has helped save the lives of many athletes and even headed up a professional tennis team <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Wranglers\">featuring Steffi Graf</a>.)</p> <p>In 1987, All-Star \u201cFast\u201d Eddie Johnson was banned for drugs. Chris Washburn, a former No 3 pick, was banned in 1989. In 1991, former Sixth Man of the Year, Roy Tarpley, and promising rookie Richard Dumas were both sent packing. The list goes on. But it wasn\u2019t just players. Coaches and executives were affected by substance abuse. Usually in the form of alcohol.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was in the [Continental Basketball Association],\u201d says Richardson, \u201cmy coach <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/mussebi99c.html\">Bill Musselman</a> \u2013 he used to get at that bar when the game was over and he would be red as a beat. He would be so damn drunk. But there were a lot of coaches who drunk their alcohol. Back then it was more accepted.\u201d</p> <p>In the NBA, drug abuse was so rampant in the 1980s (<a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/the-time-michael-jordan-walked-in-on-bulls-teammates-doing-cocaine\">even Michael Jordan has talked about it</a>) that teams were said to have hired <a href=\"https://thehub.news/savoir-faire-norm-nixons-lakers/\">private investigators</a> to spy on their players, from Los Angeles Lakers All-Star Norm Nixon to Richardson when he was with the Golden State Warriors. Richardson believes his lifetime ban, along with Bias\u2019s death and the other suspensions, finally forced players to confront their drug use. They knew real repercussions were around the corner, that the league was demanding better behavior. Still, the NBA, like all walks of life, has since had to deal with other examples, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/health/2024/03/12/vin-baker-recovery-opens-tuesday-offering-mix-of-addiction-treatments/72894757007/\">from alcohol abuse</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/20/sport/rex-chapman-autobiography-drug-gambling-addiction-spt-intl/index.html\">prescription drug dependence</a>.</p> <p>Other leagues <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC6dRUz76B4\">like the NFL</a> and MLB have also had to deal with serious drug issues, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/02/22/mlb-opioid-epidemic-eric-kay-trial/\">from opioids</a> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3095672/\">to painkillers</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/sports/mlb/mlb-biggest-scandals-steroids-gambling-sign-stealing/3369188/\">to steroids</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chiefs-travis-kelce-estimates-up-to-80-percent-of-nfl-players-use-cannabis/\">to cannabis</a> use, which is legal in many US states now and which the NBA stopped <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2023/04/03/nba-will-no-longer-penalize-marijuana-use-report-says-heres-how-other-leagues-measure-up/\">testing for in 2021</a> (a fact that irks Richardson, who has been drug-free now for decades). And all sports are facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/15/its-an-addiction-nbas-ties-to-gambling-trouble-players-past-and-present\">problems with gambling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/sports-betting-gambling-professional-athletes-dg/index.html\">gambling addictions</a>.

      "bodyText": "Micheal Ray Richardson was a brilliant player: a four-time NBA All-Star guard. He was also the first player banned for life by the league for drug use, something which was far more common during his playing days. Back in the 1980s, substances like cocaine were not only part of professional sports but also society and entertainment at large, and Richardson says talk about drugs was routine during what some still call the NBA\u2019s cocaine era. \u201cDuring warmups,\u201d Richardson says, \u201cguys on different teams would say, \u2018Yo, man, I got what you\u2019re looking for. Let\u2019s get together when [the game] is over.\u2019 And boom that\u2019s how it got going.\u201d At the time, drugs were \u201ceverywhere \u2013 it was like a fad,\u201d says Richardson, who also goes by the nickname Sugar. But in the NBA, it alienated many fans. So much so that to correct the problem, the NBA instituted a three-strike system, which led to Richardson\u2019s 1986 banishment (all of which he discusses in his forthcoming memoir, Banned). Today, aside from the 10ft basket and the five-on-five competition, the NBA does not resemble the league in the late 1970s and early 1980s. But when it comes to drugs, that change took time. For Richardson, who grew up modestly in the midwest and only got into drugs after succumbing to peer pressure while living in New York City and playing for the Knicks, drugs were not a part of his early life. Then they overtook him and led to a debilitating years-long addiction. But his story is far from unique. When David Stern took over as commissioner of the NBA in 1984, one of his top priorities, along with promoting the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry, was cleaning up the game. That meant suspensions and lifetime bans (Richardson was also the first player reinstated to the NBA, in 1988, but he never returned to the league). Still, pro basketball in those days was littered with addiction and lost potential. Marvin \u201cBad News\u201d Barnes is perhaps the poster child for drug issues. His biography, Bad News, details a life of drug abuse, which included hanging out with drug kingpins, derailing what could have been a Hall of Fame career. He went from averaging 24.1 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in 1975-76 in the ABA to 9.6 and 4.8 a season later in the NBA. Barnes was out of pro hoops by 1980 and, despite trying many times, never kicked his habit before passing away in 2014. But Barnes, too, is not an isolated case. In 1986, the same year Richardson was banned for life, Boston Celtics rookie Len Bias, died from a drug overdose at the age of 22 mere hours after being drafted. \u201cHe got ahold of some bad stuff,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cThat was a sad moment. A wakeup call for everybody.\u201d Also in 1986, All-Star John Drew was banned for life for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy. That same year, Rockets guard John Lucas was waived by the team because his drug issues had become so bad. (Lucas later turned his life around, became an NBA coach, founded a rehabilitation center, which has helped save the lives of many athletes and even headed up a professional tennis team featuring Steffi Graf.) In 1987, All-Star \u201cFast\u201d Eddie Johnson was banned for drugs. Chris Washburn, a former No 3 pick, was banned in 1989. In 1991, former Sixth Man of the Year, Roy Tarpley, and promising rookie Richard Dumas were both sent packing. The list goes on. But it wasn\u2019t just players. Coaches and executives were affected by substance abuse. Usually in the form of alcohol. \u201cWhen I was in the [Continental Basketball Association],\u201d says Richardson, \u201cmy coach Bill Musselman \u2013 he used to get at that bar when the game was over and he would be red as a beat. He would be so damn drunk. But there were a lot of coaches who drunk their alcohol. Back then it was more accepted.\u201d In the NBA, drug abuse was so rampant in the 1980s (even Michael Jordan has talked about it) that teams were said to have hired private investigators to spy on their players, from Los Angeles Lakers All-Star Norm Nixon to Richardson when he was with the Golden State Warriors. Richardson believes his lifetime ban, along with Bias\u2019s death and the other suspensions, finally forced players to confront their drug use. They knew real repercussions were around the corner, that the league was demanding better behavior. Still, the NBA, like all walks of life, has since had to deal with other examples, from alcohol abuse to prescription drug dependence. Other leagues like the NFL and MLB have also had to deal with serious drug issues, from opioids to painkillers to steroids to cannabis use, which is legal in many US states now and which the NBA stopped testing for in 2021 (a fact that irks Richardson, who has been drug-free now for decades). And all sports are facing problems with gambling and gambling addictions. When it comes to the NBA, Richardson says, there were issues with heroin (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar even admitted to trying it once) and then crack. The only remedy was distance. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep yourself out of those place,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cWhere it won\u2019t give you opportunities to do it. Keep yourself out of those environments.\u201d Today, the NBA looks at substance abuse and drug addiction as part of a bigger picture, offering its players a multi-pronged attack that focuses on mental health. At a time when the US is suffering from fentanyl and opioid epidemics and other debilitating social issues, the NBA is working to educate its workforce about the perils of drug use and addiction as well as focusing on others issues that can affect one\u2019s mental state. With annual salaries rising to as much as $60m-plus, there is a lot to be protected. Indeed, the league has come a long way over the years.

They aren\u2019t alone among US sports teams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite baseball\u2019s emphasis on statistical analysis, there is no public database of race or ethnicity information about its players, so racial biases have proven hard to analyze. Using the <a href=\"https://sabr.org/bioproj/topic/baseball-demographics-1947-2016/\">racial classifications of 11,000 major league players</a> painstakingly collected by hand by baseball researchers Mark Armour and Dan Levitt, I built an artificial intelligence model based on players\u2019 faces and names to identify their perceived race. While the model could not say how a player might self-identify, it predicted how an outside human research assistant would guess their racial background about as accurately (94%) as <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10742-022-00273-z\">another human would</a>. I ran the model on all players with headshots and names in major and minor league history from 1950 to 2019, which amounted to about 40,000 players.</p> <p>Teams usually start recently drafted players in the low minors, and the plan is that they slowly advance through six levels of increasing skill until they reach the majors (some players jump a few levels if they are good enough). After adjusting for hitting and fielding statistics, as well as the age of the players and where in the draft they were selected, I discovered teams were much less likely to promote Black and Latino players to the next level of the minors, even when they had nearly identical playing records as white counterparts. Statistics show that, since 1950, once Black and Latino players make the majors, they <a href=\"https://sabr.org/bioproj/topic/baseball-demographics-1947-2016/\">outproduce</a> their white colleagues, demonstrating that this bias is not justified by their results on the field.</p> <p>One of the players who joined the minors in the wake of Jackie Robinson\u2019s achievement was Ron Allen, who worked his way up to a short spell in the majors <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/allenro01.shtml\">in 1972</a>. Allen comes from a baseball family. One of his brothers, <a href=\"https://ballnine.com/2022/01/17/allens-journey/\">Dick</a>, is <a href=\"https://blogs.fangraphs.com/2022-golden-days-era-committee-candidate-dick-allen/\">arguably</a> the best third basemen <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/jaws_3B.shtml\">in baseball history</a> <a href=\"https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/50-year-old-bad-press-keeping-dick-allen-hall-fame/\">not to make the Hall of Fame</a>. Ron\u2019s oldest brother, Hank, was a longtime scout for the Houston Astros through <a href=\"https://ripbaseball.com/2024/06/17/obituary-hank-allen-1940-2024/\">2017</a> and a successful MLB player in his own right. Both Dick and Hank died recently. All three came through the minors in the heart of the civil rights era.</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t make no difference if I hit .300 and [a white player] hit .270, he was gonna be moved ahead of me,\u201d Allen said.</p> <p>Allen is right: the effect of racial bias was large. The disadvantage Black players faced was comparable to having an On-Base plus Slugging (OPS, an all-inclusive hitting metric) about 35 points lower than they actually had \u2013 or about the difference between the offenses of the Houston Astros and the St Louis Cardinals, who had the 11th best and 15th best records in baseball respectively this year. This effect also stayed the same from 2000-2019 compared to 1950-2000: Black and Latino players are still promoted less than their performances would indicate they should be, based on a statistical model predicting promotions. MLB declined to comment on the results of this study.</p> <p>There was also a correlation among Black and Latino players between the physical color of a player\u2019s skin and whether they moved up to the next level of the minors. I took the color of a player\u2019s skin from their roster headshot, and measured the color by putting it on a quantitative scale from black to white. The impact of going from a relatively light-skinned Black or Latino player (at the 25th percentile of skin color) to a darker-skinned player (at the 75th percentile) was approximately 40 points of OPS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-4559Gl28CB0AvKbw/\" data-alt=\"A chart showing how minor league players of color are promoted \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-4559Gl28CB0AvKbw/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Though the disadvantage was measurable and significant, a 10-20% handicap in promotion rate wasn\u2019t usually enough to stop all-time greats from making the majors. Players like Aaron, Mays, and Roy Campanella, as well as many other pioneers of the era, were so much better than their competition that a bias against them was a speed bump, not a roadblock. But for more marginal players, those without Hall of Fame talent, it could end their careers, especially when combined with other forms of bias, like teams channeling Black and Latino players to certain positions.</p> <p>Some of the greatest Black players throughout baseball history have patrolled the outfield, from Aaron to Mays to Aaron Judge. Yet there are comparatively fewer Black players at other spots on the diamond such as catcher, second base, third base, and starting pitcher, limiting the career prospects and earnings of talented Black players with the skills to play these positions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=aaron-001wil\">Wil Aaron</a> came up in 1971. While he was a skilled hitter and deft fielder at second base, his team forced him to transition to the outfield. (Wil is also Hank Aaron\u2019s cousin.) Wil Aaron\u2019s story is all too common. \u201cThese positions, second base, shortstop, pitcher and catcher, those are the control positions. Those are the quarterback positions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Catchers were most often the victims of this bias. Before 2000, about 3% of players identified as Black in the minors were at catcher, compared to almost 10% of white players. Each year in the minors before 2000, Black catchers moved to other positions about 50% more often than white catchers, even though the Black players were hitting and fielding better than their white counterparts. Once moved to the outfield, however, teams shifted Black players from the outfield to other positions about half as often as white outfielders.</p> <p>Unlike other sports where Black players have started to comprise a larger share of historically white positions \u2013 NFL quarterbacks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/04/the-black-quarterback-is-now-the-nfls-leading-man-but-at-what-cost\">are perhaps the most striking example</a> \u2013 there has been little or no progress in recent years in baseball. The rate of Black catchers since 2000 has fallen to less than 2% in the minors, and the percentage of Black players in the outfield is at 47% \u2013 right where it was before 2000. Since 2000, there have been only a handful of full-time, every day Black catchers in MLB.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-45591Jd943SDJS67/\" data-alt=\"A chart showing how skin tone determines player position in baseball\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-45591Jd943SDJS67/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Among Black and Latino players, the lighter a player\u2019s skin tone was, the more likely they were to play catcher or shortstop or pitcher. The darker a player\u2019s skin tone, the more likely they were to play the outfield. Among white players, there were no significant differences in skin tone between players at different positions.</p> <p>There are more Black pitchers after 2000, but there are more pitchers in general, due to <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/bullpen-use-has-changed-greatly-over-time-c216982016\">strategic changes</a> in the game, so the ratio of white to Black pitchers has remained the same. And Black and Latino pitchers are often relegated to middle relief, the least important and valued type of pitcher: they tended to have fewer games started and fewer saves than white pitchers, despite, on average, having a better strikeout to walk ratio and allowing fewer runs per opposing batter faced.</p> <p>Some types of bias did disappear from the game after the civil rights era. In the early days after integration, opposing pitchers often tried to retaliate against Black players by hitting them with thrown pitches, as <a href=\"https://sabr.org/journal/article/were-pitchers-more-likely-to-throw-at-black-batters-1947-66/\">Robinson experienced</a>. Over a 20-year period from 1950-1970, pitchers struck Black hitters in the minors twice as often as white players.</p> <p>Opposing white pitchers often targeted Allen, and some years he had a hit-by-pitch rate over four times as high as the average. \u201cSometimes a catcher would warn you,\u201d Allen said. \u201cHe would tell you: \u2018Hang loose\u2019. So that meant you were gonna get plunked.\u201d The increased HBP rates declined by 1970 and Black and white HBP rates have been much closer since then.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/before-brooklyn-the-secret-heroes-who-helped-break-baseballs-color-barrier\">Before Brooklyn: the secret heroes who helped break baseball\u2019s color barrier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Allen wasn\u2019t surprised that racial bias around positions and promotions hadn\u2019t disappeared in recent years. \u201cI remember when Hank said to me one time when the movie was out, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/15/42-jackie-robinson-film-review\">42, about Jackie Robinson</a>.\u201d Allen said. \u201c[Hank] said, \u2018Man, I can\u2019t watch that.\u2019 And I said, \u2018How come, Hank?\u2019 He said, \u2018Because we lived it, I can\u2019t go through that again.\u2019 And I started laughing. He said, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to laugh about!\u2019 I said, \u2018But you know, that\u2019s behind us now, you know.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, it ain\u2019t behind us, it\u2019s still there.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While MLB\u2019s player base has grown increasingly diverse in recent years, with sizable Latin American and Asian contingents, team management has continued to be overwhelmingly white, perhaps partly explaining why racial biases continue to exist. The Institute For Diversity And Ethics In Sport <a href=\"https://www.tidesport.org/mlb\">publishes reports</a> on the demographics of MLB\u2019s (and other sports\u2019) leadership positions. In 2004, the earliest report listed on their website, there were seven Black or Latino managers; in 2023, there were six. Among senior front office members, 17% were people of color in 2004; in 2023, 21%. About 40% of MLB\u2019s players are people of color.</p> <p>As teams increasingly use statistical approaches to evaluate players that are intended to be blind to race and color, many front office employees expected that biases might begin to disappear. Ben Baumer, a former analyst for the Mets who is now a professor of statistical and data sciences at Smith College, noted that sabermetrics is not a cure-all for discrimination. Predictive algorithms trained on biased data \u2013 for example, where Black players often move to the outfield and don\u2019t tend to make the majors as often due to bias \u2013 may learn to predict that players who recently switched to the outfield are less valuable prospects, echoing the bias in the data used to train them. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a lot of the data science products at least in part with the idea that we would be removing bias by having machine learning algorithms,\u201d Baumer said. \u201cIn a lot of cases, we\u2019re actually amplifying the systemic inequalities that are present in the data.\u201d</p> <p>Front office sources both past and present agreed that there are often hidden stereotypes and <a href=\"https://archive.is/P4F4T\">coded language</a> used to describe players based on their race. \u201cHow many non-white gamers have ever been named as a gamer?\u201d said Fernando Perez, a former major leaguer who is now a coach with the San Francisco Giants. (A \u201c<a href=\"https://www.baseball-almanac.com/dictionary-term.php?term=gamer\">gamer</a>\u201d is a clutch, reliable or especially competitive player.) Using a database of Cincinnati Reds amateur scouting reports from 1998-2003 originally reported on <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2019/3/4/18249155/cincinnati-reds-scouting-report-series-part-1-data-findings\">by the Ringer</a>, I found obvious differences in how scouts described white, Black, and Latino players. Nine times out of 10, the words \u201cgamer,\u201d \u201cleader,\u201d and \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cgood makeup,\u201d were applied to white players (\u201cmakeup\u201d <a href=\"https://www.baseball-almanac.com/dictionary-term.php?term=makeup\">refers </a>to the mental aspect of the sport). Meanwhile, comments about \u201cquestionable\u201d makeup, laziness, background, and even a player\u2019s father or their hairstyle were all at least twice as likely to be applied to Black and Latino players. Two front office employees with different teams recalled separate instances of overt and explicit racial discrimination among influential front office employees and scouts, and the book Under Jackie\u2019s Shadow contains a recent story of clearcut racial discrimination as well.</p> <p>While some front office employees mentioned overt racism, others said that their teams made a proactive effort to recruit diverse talent and eliminate bias from their evaluations. Players and front office employees who had worked for multiple teams said that different front office cultures could have wildly divergent attitudes and tolerance for coded language and racial bias, and that some teams were genuinely progressive \u2013 and sometimes benefited by hiring players other teams might undervalue.</p> <p>The impact of racial bias on those affected is enduring. In addition to the impact on players\u2019 careers and livelihoods, research has shown that experiencing racial bias can <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/minority-health/racism-health/index-1.html\">harm health</a> and psychological wellbeing in the long-term. \u201cCan you believe this? I\u2019m 72 years old, and I have nightmares \u2026 I\u2019m running in uniform to catch the train, and the train is moving off down the track with the rest of the team on it,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cPeople are telling me, \u2018Oh, just put it aside. Just forget about it. Let it go.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Aaron continued, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to let go, man, when you\u2019ve been done wrong.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Thanks to Brandon Smith for research assistance, and Mark Armour, Daniel Levitt, the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), and Baseball Prospectus for providing key data.</em></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947 to usher in a historic moment for civil rights, yet Black representation in Major League Baseball stands at the lowest level since the 1950s. MLB initiatives have increased the number of Black players taken with top draft picks since 2010 \u2013 but those draftees haven\u2019t made their way up from the minors often enough to stop the decline in the number of Black players in the majors. An exclusive new analysis of the minor leagues shows one factor stopping Black players from making the majors: there has been persistent bias against Black and Latino players since 1950, preventing them from playing at certain positions and rising through the ranks of the minors. Players of color with darker skin often moved to the outfield and suffered the most bias. Conversations with former players, scouts, front office analysts, and baseball historians confirm those findings, with some recalling instances of overt bias even within the last 20 years. Mitchell Nathanson, a law professor at Villanova and baseball historian, wrote a 2024 book called Under Jackie\u2019s Shadow on the racism that Black minor leaguers faced from around 1950-1970. The book collects accounts from 13 Black players who came up through extraordinary barriers and often saw their careers ended or shortened by bias. \u201cI think that white people like a validating, happy ending to a story. So they\u2019ll read about Willie Mays and Hank Aaron, because those stories end up with the players in the Hall of Fame \u2013 they succeeded,\u201d Nathanson said. \u201cSo you can kind of separate yourself from that, right? Because: \u2018Oh it was this horrible thing that happened, but look what happened after: They persevered.\u2019 Isn\u2019t this a great American story? Well, that\u2019s bullshit. Yes, those players are fantastic players, but that doesn\u2019t justify any of the treatment they received. And it also ignores all the other players who didn\u2019t have that level of talent and whose lives were ruined by this.\u201d Despite baseball\u2019s emphasis on statistical analysis, there is no public database of race or ethnicity information about its players, so racial biases have proven hard to analyze. Using the racial classifications of 11,000 major league players painstakingly collected by hand by baseball researchers Mark Armour and Dan Levitt, I built an artificial intelligence model based on players\u2019 faces and names to identify their perceived race. While the model could not say how a player might self-identify, it predicted how an outside human research assistant would guess their racial background about as accurately (94%) as another human would. I ran the model on all players with headshots and names in major and minor league history from 1950 to 2019, which amounted to about 40,000 players. Teams usually start recently drafted players in the low minors, and the plan is that they slowly advance through six levels of increasing skill until they reach the majors (some players jump a few levels if they are good enough). After adjusting for hitting and fielding statistics, as well as the age of the players and where in the draft they were selected, I discovered teams were much less likely to promote Black and Latino players to the next level of the minors, even when they had nearly identical playing records as white counterparts. Statistics show that, since 1950, once Black and Latino players make the majors, they outproduce their white colleagues, demonstrating that this bias is not justified by their results on the field. One of the players who joined the minors in the wake of Jackie Robinson\u2019s achievement was Ron Allen, who worked his way up to a short spell in the majors in 1972. Allen comes from a baseball family. One of his brothers, Dick, is arguably the best third basemen in baseball history not to make the Hall of Fame. Ron\u2019s oldest brother, Hank, was a longtime scout for the Houston Astros through 2017 and a successful MLB player in his own right. Both Dick and Hank died recently. All three came through the minors in the heart of the civil rights era. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make no difference if I hit .300 and [a white player] hit .270, he was gonna be moved ahead of me,\u201d Allen said. Allen is right: the effect of racial bias was large. The disadvantage Black players faced was comparable to having an On-Base plus Slugging (OPS, an all-inclusive hitting metric) about 35 points lower than they actually had \u2013 or about the difference between the offenses of the Houston Astros and the St Louis Cardinals, who had the 11th best and 15th best records in baseball respectively this year. This effect also stayed the same from 2000-2019 compared to 1950-2000: Black and Latino players are still promoted less than their performances would indicate they should be, based on a statistical model predicting promotions. MLB declined to comment on the results of this study. There was also a correlation among Black and Latino players between the physical color of a player\u2019s skin and whether they moved up to the next level of the minors. I took the color of a player\u2019s skin from their roster headshot, and measured the color by putting it on a quantitative scale from black to white. The impact of going from a relatively light-skinned Black or Latino player (at the 25th percentile of skin color) to a darker-skinned player (at the 75th percentile) was approximately 40 points of OPS. Though the disadvantage was measurable and significant, a 10-20% handicap in promotion rate wasn\u2019t usually enough to stop all-time greats from making the majors. Players like Aaron, Mays, and Roy Campanella, as well as many other pioneers of the era, were so much better than their competition that a bias against them was a speed bump, not a roadblock. But for more marginal players, those without Hall of Fame talent, it could end their careers, especially when combined with other forms of bias, like teams channeling Black and Latino players to certain positions. Some of the greatest Black players throughout baseball history have patrolled the outfield, from Aaron to Mays to Aaron Judge. Yet there are comparatively fewer Black players at other spots on the diamond such as catcher, second base, third base, and starting pitcher, limiting the career prospects and earnings of talented Black players with the skills to play these positions. Wil Aaron came up in 1971. While he was a skilled hitter and deft fielder at second base, his team forced him to transition to the outfield. (Wil is also Hank Aaron\u2019s cousin.) Wil Aaron\u2019s story is all too common. \u201cThese positions, second base, shortstop, pitcher and catcher, those are the control positions. Those are the quarterback positions,\u201d he said. Catchers were most often the victims of this bias. Before 2000, about 3% of players identified as Black in the minors were at catcher, compared to almost 10% of white players. Each year in the minors before 2000, Black catchers moved to other positions about 50% more often than white catchers, even though the Black players were hitting and fielding better than their white counterparts. Once moved to the outfield, however, teams shifted Black players from the outfield to other positions about half as often as white outfielders. Unlike other sports where Black players have started to comprise a larger share of historically white positions \u2013 NFL quarterbacks are perhaps the most striking example \u2013 there has been little or no progress in recent years in baseball. The rate of Black catchers since 2000 has fallen to less than 2% in the minors, and the percentage of Black players in the outfield is at 47% \u2013 right where it was before 2000. Since 2000, there have been only a handful of full-time, every day Black catchers in MLB. Among Black and Latino players, the lighter a player\u2019s skin tone was, the more likely they were to play catcher or shortstop or pitcher. The darker a player\u2019s skin tone, the more likely they were to play the outfield. Among white players, there were no significant differences in skin tone between players at different positions. There are more Black pitchers after 2000, but there are more pitchers in general, due to strategic changes in the game, so the ratio of white to Black pitchers has remained the same. And Black and Latino pitchers are often relegated to middle relief, the least important and valued type of pitcher: they tended to have fewer games started and fewer saves than white pitchers, despite, on average, having a better strikeout to walk ratio and allowing fewer runs per opposing batter faced. Some types of bias did disappear from the game after the civil rights era. In the early days after integration, opposing pitchers often tried to retaliate against Black players by hitting them with thrown pitches, as Robinson experienced. Over a 20-year period from 1950-1970, pitchers struck Black hitters in the minors twice as often as white players. Opposing white pitchers often targeted Allen, and some years he had a hit-by-pitch rate over four times as high as the average. \u201cSometimes a catcher would warn you,\u201d Allen said. \u201cHe would tell you: \u2018Hang loose\u2019. So that meant you were gonna get plunked.\u201d The increased HBP rates declined by 1970 and Black and white HBP rates have been much closer since then. Allen wasn\u2019t surprised that racial bias around positions and promotions hadn\u2019t disappeared in recent years. \u201cI remember when Hank said to me one time when the movie was out, 42, about Jackie Robinson.\u201d Allen said. \u201c[Hank] said, \u2018Man, I can\u2019t watch that.\u2019 And I said, \u2018How come, Hank?\u2019 He said, \u2018Because we lived it, I can\u2019t go through that again.\u2019 And I started laughing. He said, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to laugh about!\u2019 I said, \u2018But you know, that\u2019s behind us now, you know.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, it ain\u2019t behind us, it\u2019s still there.\u2019\u201d While MLB\u2019s player base has grown increasingly diverse in recent years, with sizable Latin American and Asian contingents, team management has continued to be overwhelmingly white, perhaps partly explaining why racial biases continue to exist. The Institute For Diversity And Ethics In Sport publishes reports on the demographics of MLB\u2019s (and other sports\u2019) leadership positions. In 2004, the earliest report listed on their website, there were seven Black or Latino managers; in 2023, there were six. Among senior front office members, 17% were people of color in 2004; in 2023, 21%. About 40% of MLB\u2019s players are people of color. As teams increasingly use statistical approaches to evaluate players that are intended to be blind to race and color, many front office employees expected that biases might begin to disappear. Ben Baumer, a former analyst for the Mets who is now a professor of statistical and data sciences at Smith College, noted that sabermetrics is not a cure-all for discrimination. Predictive algorithms trained on biased data \u2013 for example, where Black players often move to the outfield and don\u2019t tend to make the majors as often due to bias \u2013 may learn to predict that players who recently switched to the outfield are less valuable prospects, echoing the bias in the data used to train them. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a lot of the data science products at least in part with the idea that we would be removing bias by having machine learning algorithms,\u201d Baumer said. \u201cIn a lot of cases, we\u2019re actually amplifying the systemic inequalities that are present in the data.\u201d Front office sources both past and present agreed that there are often hidden stereotypes and coded language used to describe players based on their race. \u201cHow many non-white gamers have ever been named as a gamer?\u201d said Fernando Perez, a former major leaguer who is now a coach with the San Francisco Giants. (A \u201cgamer\u201d is a clutch, reliable or especially competitive player.) Using a database of Cincinnati Reds amateur scouting reports from 1998-2003 originally reported on by the Ringer, I found obvious differences in how scouts described white, Black, and Latino players. Nine times out of 10, the words \u201cgamer,\u201d \u201cleader,\u201d and \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cgood makeup,\u201d were applied to white players (\u201cmakeup\u201d refers to the mental aspect of the sport). Meanwhile, comments about \u201cquestionable\u201d makeup, laziness, background, and even a player\u2019s father or their hairstyle were all at least twice as likely to be applied to Black and Latino players. Two front office employees with different teams recalled separate instances of overt and explicit racial discrimination among influential front office employees and scouts, and the book Under Jackie\u2019s Shadow contains a recent story of clearcut racial discrimination as well. While some front office employees mentioned overt racism, others said that their teams made a proactive effort to recruit diverse talent and eliminate bias from their evaluations. Players and front office employees who had worked for multiple teams said that different front office cultures could have wildly divergent attitudes and tolerance for coded language and racial bias, and that some teams were genuinely progressive \u2013 and sometimes benefited by hiring players other teams might undervalue. The impact of racial bias on those affected is enduring. In addition to the impact on players\u2019 careers and livelihoods, research has shown that experiencing racial bias can harm health and psychological wellbeing in the long-term. \u201cCan you believe this? I\u2019m 72 years old, and I have nightmares \u2026 I\u2019m running in uniform to catch the train, and the train is moving off down the track with the rest of the team on it,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cPeople are telling me, \u2018Oh, just put it aside. Just forget about it. Let it go.\u2019\u201d Aaron continued, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to let go, man, when you\u2019ve been done wrong.\u201d Thanks to Brandon Smith for research assistance, and Mark Armour, Daniel Levitt, the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), and Baseball Prospectus for providing key data.",

Spying Juliet at her window after the Capulet ball, Romeo fervently describes her expressive form: \u201cshe speaks\u201d. The next phrase is, however, the more telling: \u201cyet she says nothing\u201d. It\u2019s not literally true: Juliet does speak, famously, of her impatient desire and her willingness to submit herself to near-death for her&nbsp;love, but like almost all other Shakespeare heroines, she does it less&nbsp;than her male counterparts.</p> <p>Only in Rosalind, the spirited heroine of As You Like It, striding around the Forest of Arden in doublet and hose and flirting with men and women alike, is there a Shakespearean female character who has the lioness\u2019s share of the play\u2019s lines. More often, women watch, silent. Hamlet\u2019s mother Gertrude, for instance, is on stage for almost half the play but speaks one line to every 10 from her garrulous son, who nevertheless has the gall to describe his own excessive speech as \u201clike a drab\u201d (whore).</p> <p>Walter, who has played more than a&nbsp;score of Shakespearean roles from Viola to Brutus, admits \u201cI worship Shakespeare\u201d. She nevertheless wants to take him to task for the limitations on his insights into women and women\u2019s lives. Her book provides a series of supplementary speeches, mostly in rhyming iambic pentameter, introduced with brief but revealing snippets of her own connection to the characters across her career. In The&nbsp;Turning of the Shrew, she has Shakespeare\u2019s \u201ctamed\u201d Katherine confront an imagined audience and ask \u201cWhose side are you on, ladies?\u201d Walter ranges from cheerily calling out&nbsp;Bianca\u2019s \u201canger issues\u201d and questioning her marriage to \u201cthat wanker\u201d, to the sharper recognition of anyone \u201cwhose husband knows just where to hide a bruise\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A funny colloquy of motherless daughters all point out moments where \u2018I missed a mum\u2019 and urge writers to include maternal figures in their plays</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These speeches often propose brilliant alternative insights, female perspectives on familiar stories.

(Eg, in<a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024\"> the Australian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/australia-a-laggard-in-the-global-battle-to-beat-inflation-20241022-p5kk9m\">the AFR</a>.)</p> \n  <p>First up, the forecasts sound scary, such as headline inflation rising from 3% at the end of this year to 3.7% by the end of next year. That\u2019s not the direction we want to travel.</p> \n  <p>However, that\u2019s hardly news. The<strong> Reserve Bank</strong>\u2019s August <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2024/aug/pdf/statement-on-monetary-policy-2024-08.pdf\">statement on monetary policy</a> predicts the rate to rise from 3% to 3.7% over the comparable period. </p> \n  <p>We\u2019re also well accustomed to the RBA\u2019s more lenient approach to bringing down inflation - the aim is to retain as many of the job gains as possible. (That part of the mandate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/17/australia-unemployment-rate-september-2024-rba-interest-rates\">is holding up perhaps a tad too well</a> if you\u2019re hoping for an early interest rate cut.)</p> \n  <p>Recall that headline consumer price inflation has been artificially lowered lately by energy and housing rebates. </p> \n  <p>Now some of those won\u2019t be repeated \u2013 eg Queensland\u2019s $1000 per household handout on 1 July \u2013 but it remains highly likely that a federal government seeking reelection is going to offer some sort of rebates for next year (and the opposition will probably seek to match or exceed them).</p> \n  <p>The RBA, of course, can\u2019t anticipate what those rebates will be so they don\u2019t include any. Hey presto, headline CPI rises next year.</p> \n  <p>The central bank, of course, pays more attention to underlying inflation. On current forecasts, the trimmed mean measure will ease from 3.5% at year\u2019s end to 2.9% by December 2025.</p> \n  <p>Those predictions will get updated ahead of the RBA\u2019s next board meeting on 4-5 November. On 30 October, we\u2019ll also have September quarter inflation data - the real numbers that we need to fuss about.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671825368f08deab319f3d77\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/amanda-meade\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-22T22:21:29.837Z\">11.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Federal court to make cost ruling in Lehrmann case</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The federal court will rule this morning on whether <strong>Bruce Lehrmann</strong> will be allowed to stay the costs order of $2m made by <strong>Justice Michael Lee</strong> in the defamation case.</p> \n  <p>Lehrmann is appealing his defamation loss against <strong>Network Ten </strong>and<strong> Lisa Wilkinson</strong> but is unemployed and is unable to pay his legal costs.</p> \n  <p><strong>Justice Wendy Abraham</strong> will also rule on whether Ten\u2019s application for a $200,000 security of costs order has been successful.</p> \n  <p>Lehrmann has argued there is a genuine public interest in allowing an appeal and a risk that if the security of costs is granted it may abort the appeal.</p> \n  <p>In April, Lee found Lehrmann was not defamed by Wilkinson and Ten when The Project broadcast an interview with <strong>Brittany Higgins</strong> on 15 February 2021 in which she alleged she was raped by a staffer.</p> \n  <p>Lee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/15/bruce-lehrmann-defamation-trial-judge-verdict-rape-brittany-higgins-parliament-house-ntwnfb\">found on the balance of probabilities</a> Lehrmann raped Higgins on a minister\u2019s couch in Parliament House in 2019.</p> \n  <p>Lehrmann has always denied the rape allegation and pleaded not guilty at his criminal trial in the Australian Capital Territory supreme court which was aborted.

Here\u2019s a summary of the main developments: The Australian Catholic University will reimburse attenders of a graduation ceremony where Joe de Bruyn sparked a walkout with a speech denouncing abortion and same-sex marriage. The media union has called Peter Dutton\u2019s behaviour towards two ABC reporters \u201cunnecessarily aggressive\u201d as the public broadcaster vowed to continue to ask the opposition leader and others tough questions. A woman accused of displaying the Hezbollah flag at a pro-Palestine protest in Sydney will contest the allegations in court. The lawyer for Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto has rejected claims the Liberal leader created a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in order to expel Moira Deeming, telling a court he acted to \u201ccauterise the damage\u201d after neo-Nazis gatecrashed a rally the MP helped organised. The federal court has granted Bruce Lehrmann a stay of the $2m costs order made by Justice Michael Lee, allowing an appeal against the dismissal of his defamation suit against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson to go ahead. At least seven people were killed and more than a dozen remain missing after gunmen ambushed a public bus and shot passengers in Papua New Guinea\u2019s Enga province. Thanks for reading. Have a pleasant evening Moira Deeming created \u2018extreme\u2019 political problem akin to \u2018lobster with a mobster\u2019 incident, defamation trial told John Pesutto\u2019s lawyer has rejected claims the Victorian Liberal leader created a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in order to expel Moira Deeming, telling a court he acted to \u201ccauterise the damage\u201d after neo-Nazis gatecrashed a rally the MP helped organised. Deeming, who now sits on the crossbench after her expulsion from the state parliamentary Liberal party, is suing Pesutto for allegedly falsely portraying her as a Nazi sympathiser after she spoke at the Let Women Speak rally held on 18 March 2023, which was gatecrashed by neo-Nazis. Pesutto has denied the claim. In her closing arguments, Deeming\u2019s barrister, Sue Chrysanthou SC, asserted that Pesutto\u2019s push to expel her from the party had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the rally. \u201cThe decision to expel was so irrational and clearly not based on the reasons he put forward to the press,\u201d Chrysanthou told the federal court in Melbourne. \u201cMrs Deeming was expelled because Mr Pesutto found it annoying to have to answer press questions about her whenever she made a statement about sex-based rights.\u201d Read more: UAE agrees to trade pact on Australian minerals but China dominance sparks market angst Billions of dollars in Emirati money could soon flow into the critical mineral sector but concerns persist over whether Australia is too far behind China in the battery race. Australia and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to a trade pact that will be officially inked at the start of November and while it cuts trade tariffs, the centrepiece revolves around access to a multitrillion-dollar investment fund. Trade Minister Don Farrell expects investment to flow before the end of 2024 after he handed over a list of 55 \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects in Australia. \u201cAs soon as the agreement is signed, that\u2019s the signal to the UAE officials, Australia is open for business,\u201d Senator Farrell told AAP. \u201cI think before Christmas we will see significant investment.\u201d While the fund was built on petrodollars, the Emiratis wanted to invest in clean energy, which required critical minerals for technologies such as batteries, Senator Farrell said. One of the 55 proposals is the Kookaburra Gully graphite project in South Australia run by Lincoln Minerals. While Australia was rich with critical mineral deposits, Prof John Mavrogenes questioned how much money they could bring into the nation given Chinese dominance in processing. Australia can\u2019t process the minerals and turn them into batteries or magnets as cheaply or as well as China and Beijing effectively set wholesale prices, the critical mineral expert said. \u2013 via AAP Glasgow model would have worked in Victoria: Commonwealth Games boss Victoria could have hosted the same pared-back program as Glasgow for the same cost but the government never considered the option, Commonwealth Games Australia boss Craig Phillips says. Glasgow announced its 2026 program on Tuesday after it stepped in to host the next event following Victoria\u2019s withdrawal last year. Using just four venues, only 10 sports will be contested at a projected cost of 114m pounds ($A221.51m). Victoria cited a budget blow-out to $6bn which Phillips said was \u201coutrageous and overestimated\u201d. Instead of hosting, Victoria paid $380m in compensation to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), of which $200m has been directed to Scotland. Phillips said the Victorian government withdrew without considering scaling back the multi-sport event. \u201cWe were happy to talk to the Victorian government about finding ways of saving the costs of the Games and if eliminating sports from the program was part of that, we certainly would have had that conversation,\u201d Phillips said on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve been on record as saying before, we really didn\u2019t get that opportunity to have that conversation. \u2013 via AAP The independent senator Lidia Thorpe has played down criticism from Indigenous leaders of her protest against King Charles on Monday when she shouted \u201cyou are not out king\u201d at him. Thorpe, speaking to ABC News\u2019 Greg Jennett, said she had received positive feedback from some elders who told her that her protest had \u201clit a fire back in their belly\u201d, but dismissed other Indigenous leaders who had criticised her. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to the noise of those who have chosen to assimilate into the colonial system. That\u2019s their decision. I\u2019ve decided to be a black sovereign woman and continue our fight against the colony and for justice for our people.\u201d Asked about whether her oath of allegiance when becoming a senator \u2013 in which she claims she deliberately mispronounced the word \u201cheirs\u201d as \u201chairs\u201d \u2013 was valid, Thorpe said \u201cwhy would I, with my hand on my heart, kneel to an oppressor?\u201d. \u201cLook, it\u2019s no it\u2019s no secret I don\u2019t like the colony. I don\u2019t like the king and what he represents, and I don\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019ve got to swear to an oppressor to do my job to get justice for my people. \u201cI am there for one reason and one reason only, and it\u2019s not to make friends, it\u2019s not to get re-elected. It is to get justice for my people.\u201d Police have found human remains in an area west of Gympie in which a 14-year-old girl was swept away in floodwaters almost three years ago. Krystal Cain was last seen by her father on the night of 8 January 2022 after they abandoned their flooded car near the Burnett Highway at Booubyjan, before she was swept away by raging flood waters in the aftermath of ex-tropical cyclone Seth. Despite a widespread search involving water police, divers, volunteers and helicopters scouring the flood plain upon which the teenager went missing, she was never found. Police found several human bones on a property at Booubyjan on Sunday. On Tuesday, a spokesperson said Queensland police were conducting forensic examinations upon the bones yet-to-be identified remains and that the investigation was expected to be protracted. Land in outer Melbourne to be unlocked under 10-year plan Swathes of land in Melbourne\u2019s outer suburbs will be unlocked over the next decade in a bid to build 180,000 new homes, AAP reports. Ploughing ahead with a week-long housing policy blitz, premier Jacinta Allan unveiled a 10-year plan to release land across 27 Melbourne greenfield areas. She said the pipeline plan for land releases across the city\u2019s outer southeast, north and west was unprecedented. \u201c(It\u2019s) the most significant commitment in history in greenfield areas to building new homes, new backyards,\u201d she told reporters on Wednesday. The first three greenfield sites will be released in Cardinia, Whittlesea and Kororoit as early as 2024 and 2025. However, there is no timeline for when building will get under way on the expected 180,000 new homes. You can read more on this here: The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, has slammed the opposition leader for an unexplained backflip on abortion. At the third leaders\u2019 debate last night, David Crisafulli said he was pro-choice. But he didn\u2019t explain at a press conference this morning why he\u2019d changed his mind since last year, when he said that he did not believe in \u201clate-term\u201d abortion. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single time that a candidate, let alone a leader, three days before an election, changes such a fundamental belief,\u201d Miles said. \u201cHow do you go from staunchly pro-life to suddenly pro-choice just a few days before the election. I think Queensland women will be rightly skeptical about the motivations behind this, but it really generates more questions than it answers. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s been able to hold his other 92 candidates to just parroting his lines, but now that he\u2019s broken ranks and told Queenslanders that he\u2019s pro-choice now all of his other 92 candidates should be allowed to give their views to and what we know is that all, bar three of them, Tim Nichols, Steve Mini can and now David Crisafulli, every single other one of them is pro life. \u201cAnd that would mean that a majority, if they had a majority, then there would be a majority in favour of laws that would force women to stay pregnant.\u201d Miles said Crisafulli had made the commitment because the Courier Mail/Sky News audience \u201claughed at him\u201d for not answering questions about his beliefs. Several LNP MPs and candidates have publicly revealed themselves as opponents of abortion in recent weeks. Millions of people in NSW charged illegal merchant fees by state agencies, government says New South Wales government agencies have illegally charged people about $144m in merchant fees on an estimated 92m credit card transactions for services such as licence renewals, car registrations and fine repayments since 2016. The finance minister, Courtney Houssos, on Wednesday said the government had referred the issue to the NSW ombudsman for an investigation into \u201cpossible serious maladministration\u201d after the state auditor general alerted it to the issue in July. The state\u2019s corruption watchdog has also been informed. Houssos said the surcharges had been passed on to tens of millions of customers despite \u201crepeated legal advice\u201d during the former Coalition government\u2019s term that Revenue NSW and Service NSW could not lawfully charge merchant fees. \u201cI find these revelations extremely concerning, and I can\u2019t see how there is an excuse for a government [agency] that was repeatedly advised that activity was unlawful and to continue to do that,\u201d she said. She said that due to a longstanding practice of new governments not being given access to advice provided to previous governments, it was impossible at this stage to say who within the previous government was informed of the issue and when. Read more from Catie McLeod and Tamsin Rose: ACU to reimburse attendees after Joe de Bruyn\u2019s anti-same-sex marriage speech The Australian Catholic University will reimburse attendees of a graduation ceremony where Joe de Bruyn sparked a walkout with a speech denouncing abortion and same-sex marriage, as the university also revealed it had urged the former union boss to reconsider his remarks before he delivered them. De Bruyn\u2019s address, delivered on Monday evening, prompted major backlash after he compared abortion to the \u201chuman toll of world war two\u201d and alleged same-sex marriage went against \u201cevery society on Earth\u201d. The vice chancellor of the ACU, Professor Zlatko Skrbis, wrote to staff on Tuesday afternoon confirming the university was aware of the contents of the address ahead of time and had allowed the speech to go ahead despite \u201cstrongly encouraging\u201d De Bruyn to reconsider his remarks.

More details on clash between police and suspected neo-Nazis AAP has more details on the clash between police and suspected neo-Nazis seeking to gatecrash a peaceful refugee rally in Melbourne last night. Roughly 300 refugee supporters were outside the Department of Home Affairs to mark 100 days of protests calling for asylum seekers to be granted permanent visas, when it was disrupted by about 20 men wearing black and covering their faces. Aran Mylvaganam from the Tamil Refugee Council said the men marched towards their encampment with an offensive banner and shouted other slogans such as \u201cHail victory\u201d, \u201cWhite power\u201d and \u201cAustralia for the white man\u201d. He labelled it \u201cquite a terrifying scene.\u201d Mylvaganam said asylum-seeker advocates initially chased the men away before police formed a line to separate the groups. Video shows police using capsicum spray to push back the suspected neo-Nazis. Victoria police said the groups dispersed and \u201cthere were no arrests or reports of injuries\u201d. Police would assess the circumstances surrounding the demonstration and review vision and people involved, it said. Mylvaganam criticised the police response, saying some advocates were subjected to the same treatment as the masked men: They pepper-sprayed some of our supporters well before they pepper-sprayed the [suspected] neo-Nazis who were delivering hate speech. One of our speakers ... who is a Palestinian activist, she was pepper sprayed. Clare Savage, the chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, is before the Senate inquiry into energy this afternoon (along with a big team), and she isn\u2019t holding back about the unreliability of coal plants in the grid. There were some 54 so-called high price periods during the quarter, when spot prices topped $5,000 per megawatt hour. Yes, the wind was particularly variable but so, it turns out, was coal. The quarter had the highest number of unplanned coal plant outages since the national electricity market introduced five-minute trading intervals in October 2021, Savage said. Spot prices are one thing, but since coal-fired plants are a major supplier of future contracts, that effect flows (so to speak) to market expectations. Hence, prices are bid up. Savage said: The [coal] plants are becoming increasingly unreliable, and the owners of many of these plants are now more reluctant to sell the same volume of contracts in case one of their units fails. \u201cThe exposure of our electricity system to international fossil fuel prices through the linking of our coal and gas markets to exports is a further source of volatility,\u201d she added, noting the lingering impacts from overseas, including Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Asked by the SA Labor senator Karen Grogan how long it would take to set up a regulatory framework for a nuclear power industry, Savage said it would be drawn out. There\u2019s the removal of the industry\u2019s \u201ccurrent prohibition\u201d (an accidental pun, we suspect), to start with. I don\u2019t have any expert view on how long it would then take to build a power station but I would have thought the regulatory framework itself would take eight to 10 years. A 21-year-old woman has been taking into custody after allegedly assaulting a child while in its mother\u2019s arms at a Perth shopping centre yesterday. Police said a woman approached a mother holding her child yesterday afternoon at the shopping centre in East Victoria Park before allegedly assaulting the child and leaving the area. Police said the child received facial injuries. The woman is not known to the mother and child, police said. Today, police said a 21-year-old female was taken into custody at Mirrabooka Shopping Centre around 11am. Further updates would be provided when available, police added. Pilot survives light plane crash in Queensland A pilot has managed to escape from a light aircraft crash near Gladstone in Queensland, before the plane caught alight. The Queensland Ambulance Service said a light aircraft went down and caught alight around 9.30am this morning on Duaringa Baralaba Road. The pilot, aged in his 30s, removed himself from the plane and was transported to hospital \u201cin a stable condition with spinal precautions\u201d, QAS said. The Courier Mail reported the man was flying a crop dusting plane, when it crashed and flipped over. Second staff member working for NSW prison charged A second staff member working for a NSW prison has been charged after she allegedly intimidated a witness who gave evidence before a special commission of inquiry into the prison system. Guardian Australia understands it was in relation to the inquiry into former prison guard Wayne Astill, who was convicted of abusing female inmates while he was a guard at a NSW prison. In September, a woman \u2013 who was an employee of Corrective Services NSW - was charged with two counts of stalk/intimidate to intend fear/physical harm, and public office misconduct after reports she allegedly intimidated a witness, according to NSW police. Yesterday, NSW police arrested a second woman who is also charged with stalk/intimidate to intend fear/ physical harm and public office misconduct. A Corrective NSW spokesperson confirmed the woman is also alleged to have intimidated a witness that gave evidence before an inquiry. Both women were charged under a NSW police operation known as Strike Force Pylane. Police said the operation was set up last July to investigate misconduct by prison staff, and attempts by prison staff to cover up information about that misconduct. Both women charged under Strike Force Pylane have been granted bail, with one set to appear before court on 29 November, and another to appear on 20 November. NSW police said, \u201cInvestigations under Strike Force Pylane continue.\u201d The first passengers have begun entering Australia without an incoming passenger card this week. Qantas has begun a pilot of the Australia Digital Travel Declaration (ATD), a digital replacement to the incoming passenger card. This is available for eligible passengers travelling from Aukland to Brisbane, initially on flight QF126. It will be expanded to include customers travelling from other New Zealand cities to Brisbane \u201cin the coming days\u201d, Qantas said, ahead of additional Australian destinations joining the program early next year. Qantas said it is looking to expand the program to other international destinations in the coming months. In a statement, the Australian Border Force said the pilot program commenced on Monday. DAFF\u2019s deputy secretary of biosecurity, Justine Saunders, said: We are pleased to see the biosecurity process becoming more integrated and streamlined while still effectively protecting Australia from harmful biosecurity pests and diseases. The success of this pilot program is a step in the right direction towards our shared end goal of achieving streamlined border clearances. As Mostafa Rachwani reported earlier this year, the change to digital could bring in an additional $50bn a year: Wrapping up her press club appearance, Allegra Spender was asked about a recent article in the Financial Review stating she had asked them to remove a reference to Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court from the powerbroking list. Was that true? Spender said \u201cI did\u201d, and then rephrased: I had heard that Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court was on the covert power list and I have a problem with this idea that women like myself get here and there is someone covertly hiding behind us pulling the strings. I am a woman of my middle ages, I spent ten or fifteen years running companies, I\u2019ve got three kids and a life I\u2019m trying to run here and this \u2026 insinuation someone out there is pulling the strings is insulting to me and it is insulting to women around Australia who are saying \u2018we make up our own minds\u2019. That for me was the big learning from the 2022 election, is that we make up our own minds. Since we are talking about women, and we talk about Peter Dutton and the Libs, one of the things that concerns me on so many different levels \u2013 including the abortion debate that we are somehow now having again \u2013 is we need women in the rooms of power and across our parliament and if the Liberal party is serious about women, I cannot understand how they have managed to preselect 17 men in Queensland out of the 18 seats that they currently hold. That to me is absolutely remarkable. You can see that it\u2019s an issue. Women, we make up our own minds, it\u2019s a thing. She received a loud applause from the room after her response. \u2018Gas a small part of energy transition\u2019, Spender says Allegra Spender was also questioned on the role of nuclear in the energy transition, as well as gas, once coal is phased out. She said she is \u201ctech-agnostic\u201d and the question is about \u201chow do we transition in a way that is right for the environment and the economy\u201d: Coal is exiting in the next 10 years, what will we do to replace that? The energy bosses said yesterday [that] nuclear is not what is going to solve the problem by 2035. Many people are sceptical we will be here before the 2040s. We need to deal with the next 10 years. I keep an open mind in terms of how nuclear as a technology evolves. Right now, the cheapest and reliable option for us in terms of dealing with the coal closure will be renewables backed by batteries but also gas. Gas is a part of the transition. Aemo has gas in part of the transition. It is a small part of the transition, but it is important \u2026 it is a fossil fuel, I\u2019d love to avoid it as much as you can, but right now it has an important role to play. Spender says Coalition stance on climate \u2018unacceptable\u2019 and says numbers \u2018crucial\u2019 in minority government discussions At the National Press Club, Allegra Spender was asked a number of times about the prospect of a minority government and said the numbers would be crucial. A reporter asked if she would consider supporting the Coalition forming government, \u201ceven when Peter Dutton has said they would dump the 2030 net zero target and that within the Coalition ranks, there are members who deny the very existence of climate change\u201d. Spender said the numbers matter because \u201cthere could be a scenario where there is 65 and 75\u201d rather than a seat or two difference. Then it is a negotiation, and that matters. Climate is incredibly important to me and my community \u2026 and frankly it is unacceptable that the Coalition pretends that they care about climate action, when they are saying they won\u2019t have a 2030 target. That is unacceptable and it is ridiculous. Let\u2019s see what actually comes out of any negotiations. Education minister meeting with Indian counterpart in Melbourne The education minister, Jason Clare, is entertaining his Indian counterpart in Melbourne today as part of a ministerial visit aiming to shore up transnational links in higher education and skills. It comes amid a deteriorating relationship between Canada and India, with allegations of the potential involvement of the Indian government in crimes against dissidents. Onshore, though, it\u2019s all smiles between Clare and Dharmendra Pradhan, who today toured RMIT, which has a partnership with the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in Pilani. Tomorrow, Pradhan will attend his second Australia-India Education and Skills Council (AIESC) meeting to be held in Sydney, with discussions to focus on Australia\u2019s research strength and industry engagement, as well as the potential for further partnerships to deliver education in India. The AIESC meeting coincides with Deakin and Wollongong universities opening in India this year, with more Australian universities expected to follow. Clare said: It is an honour to welcome Minister Pradhan back to Australia for his second visit since 2022. This is the fourth time we have caught up here or in India in the last two years. I look forward to showcasing Australia\u2019s education system and working together to further strengthen Australia\u2019s education links with India. Spender weighs in on Victorian government plans to rezone affluent suburbs Back at the National Press Club, Allegra Spender has been asked about the Victorian government\u2019s rezoning plans for 50 affluent suburbs \u2013 and the pushback by some of her fellow independents. She was asked if development is going too far in major cities. Spender said her community in Sydney is \u201cone of the densest electorates in the country\u201d, and said: We can build density that really works. I am someone who absolutely supports that we need to build more housing. We need to build it in regions, outer suburbs and also in the cities. You just have to make it work. You need to do the community consultation well, but we need more housing everywhere and that includes Wentworth. Asked if she supports high-rise housing, Spender said she supports housing \u201cin all different shapes and sizes but it has to work for the community\u201d: In my electorate, you talk to the aged care providers, childcare places, and people tell me it is as hard to get an aged care worker in Wentworth as it is in some rural communities because it is so expensive to live, so people have to come from such distances. We need to make sure we have diversity of housing, we have diversity of density and housing at different levels in the income and affordability rate, so we can still preserve that sense of community. Crisafulli pressed on abortion again in last days of Queensland election campaign The Queensland opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has again been pressed on the issue of abortion, the day after he told a debate audience he is pro-choice. But Crisafulli didn\u2019t explain why he had shifted his view since voting against legislation legalising the medical procedure in 2018. At one point in the press conference he said \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken about it in four years\u201d. But the Guardian revealed yesterday that he told a live event last year that he didn\u2019t support late-term abortions and committed to a conscience vote on the issue. He also did not explain why or when his view had changed: Speaking today, Crisafulli said: I was asked a direct question by Mr [Kerry] O\u2019Brien, and I\u2019m being asked a direct question by you. I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019ve never stood up and run a press conference speaking about that issue, not once. I\u2019ve never stood in the parliament speaking about that. Now you\u2019ll ask me a question. You\u2019ve done that repeatedly for three weeks, and I\u2019m answering the question; there\u2019ll be no change to abortion laws in Queensland. The LNP has not ruled out a conscience vote on legislation to be introduced by the Katter\u2019s Australian party on the first day of next parliament, which amends the state\u2019s Termination of Pregnancy Act 2018. Spender on how the government can reach its 2030 targets Allegra Spender is now taking questions from the audience at the National Press Club. Asked what else can be done to help the government meet its 2030 emissions reduction target, she pointed to the mining tax and said: If you don\u2019t have a reason why we need to make a change and if you can\u2019t get the community on board for why \u2026 this is actually urgent to fix, then you will not get the community support and it is much more vulnerable to the fear campaigns that we had in relation to the mining tax. She also pointed to tax reform and said there was an opportunity to \u201chelp reduce cost of living through permanently supporting households\u201d with transitioning to solar appliances: I am hearing whispers that both the major parties are going to do something more on this in the next election. That is good and we are pushing them to do that. Gosford hospital to stop offering maternity services from next March Gosford private hospital will stop offering maternity services from the end of March 2025, following the closure of eight private maternity services over the past 18 months. The decision was attributed to declining birthrates, decreasing demand for private maternity services on the Central Coast, increasing cost of living pressures and challenges with private health insurance funding. The hospital\u2019s CEO, Stephen Johnston, said birthrates had fallen by almost 40% over the last 10 years. We have now reached the point where it is no longer sustainable for us to continue to operate this service. I want to express my gratitude for the tireless work of our maternity services staff. This decision in no way reflects the work they do and the exceptional care they provide for our patients. Spender on tax, housing reform Allegra Spender is also calling for \u201cinstitutional change through a tax reform commission\u201d, to provide policy makers with \u201ccredible, tested options and a tax reform process in the next parliament\u201d. She told the NPC that taxes need to be lowered for working people, saying: We used to have a working-age population that was around six times as many as people who were retired. Now it is around four [and] in some decades\u2019 time it will be under three \u2026 Spender said tax reform is important in the long-term but housing is \u201curgent\u201d, with the parliament needing to \u201cstop wedging and start working together\u201d: The community is disgusted to see politicians wedging each other on this, when this is such a heartbreaking personal issue to so many Australians \u2026 She called on the Coalition and the Greens to back rent and shared equity scheme bills currently before parliament because \u201cthey actually solve real problems for real people\u201d. Spender says neither party has plan to deal with structural deficit in budget Addressing the crowd, Allegra Spender said Labor is \u201cvery keen\u201d to take credit for two large surpluses \u2013 but \u201cthe fact is the budget is in structural deficit and will stay here for years to come\u201d: No one, neither party has a plan to deal with this. Most of the community don\u2019t want higher taxes, they want our tax dollars to work better for our community by improved productivity in the public sector. Spender said the commonwealth spends around $10bn a year on infrastructure but \u201coften doesn\u2019t do the basic due diligence to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs, that money is spent appropriately and that lessons are learned for future projects\u201d. She said a \u201chuge amount of our public money\u201d is \u201cwasted on white elephants like the suburban rail link.\u201d We need a shift in mindset from inputs \u2013 spending more money if we care about something \u2013 to outputs, to the difference it makes. If we can\u2019t take easy decisions on infrastructure, how will we take the hard decisions on issues like health care? I will be introducing a private member\u2019s bill on this basis to deal with just this. Allegra Spender speaks to National Press Club on economic reform Allegra Spender, the Independent MP for Wentworth in Sydney, is addressing the National Press Club in Canberra on her thoughts around economic reform. Beginning her speech, she said Australia \u201ctruly [was] the lucky country\u201d but this has slipped away over 15 years as many people are left struggling \u2013 \u201cincluding people who never thought they would\u201d: People who thought they had made the right decisions, but they feel now they can\u2019t actually afford their mortgage, their rent \u2026 A recent survey found that only 15% of Australians believe home ownership is attainable \u2026 [and] less than one in 10 believe the standard of living in Australia will be better off for the next generation. Spender continued, noting that from 2004-2016 the wealth of older Australians increased by 50% while those under 35 \u201cbarely moved\u201d. The current cost of living crisis exacerbates this because it has affected profoundly those people renting, or with big mortgages and low savings. This is not just a statistic \u2013 young people know they are falling behind, they are less hopeful than previous generations. She said she was not here to \u201cpropose a silver bullet\u201d but pointed to three major economic issues facing the country: growth, intergenerational equity and the energy transition. Minimum demand and future of coal queried at Senate inquiry As suggested earlier, the Senate inquiry into energy regulation will likely go in partisan directions. Still, there are some interesting points being raised. The independent ACT senator David Pocock wanted to know what Aemo planned to do to ensure rooftop solar owners weren\u2019t being unfairly curtailed when there\u2019s abundant energy \u2013 for example, on sunny days in spring and autumn when demand for heating or cooling is low. We looked at the emerging issue of minimum system loads in this recent article: Pocock asked Aemo whether it has taken any steps to establish a market-based equivalent to its so-called Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (Rert) to deal with times when demand in the grid is too low. (The Rert system pays big energy users to reduce their demand. A reverse of that would reward firms for using more power, electric vehicle owners for charging up, etc.) Aemo\u2019s boss, Daniel Westerman, said the issue was \u201ca really important area for us operationally\u201d but didn\u2019t quite answer the question. While we continue to look for ways to make sure that we can maintain a stable and resilient grid, we also need the ultimate backstop of being able to constrain \u2013 or rather ask distribution companies \u2013 to constrain off rooftop solar. (Extra voltage is sent through the grid to switch off solar inverters \u2013 a separate but interesting problem in the grid, as we noted here.) In short, the market-based solution \u201cis still evolving\u201d, Westerman said. Watch this space, in other words. Authorities reiterate warning over e-bike batteries after latest fire in Sydney Fire authorities have reiterated warnings about the dangers of e-bikes and their batteries, after the latest fire threatened an apartment complex in Sydney overnight. Fire and Rescue New South Wales (FRNSW) crews extinguished an e-bike fire before it could take hold and harm the occupants of the small apartment building in Waterloo after the battery of one of several e-bikes stored in the ground-floor stairwell burst into flames. The fire occurred at about 12.50am on Wednesday, after the e-bike battery overheated while being charged and went into \u201cthermal runaway\u201d \u2013 \u201ca process whereby a damaged or compromised battery cell generates enough heat to ignite, setting off a chain reaction of batteries exploding and giving off flammable, toxic gas\u201d. Six fire trucks and 22 firefighters took an hour to contain and extinguish the fire before they could identify the faulty e-bike battery as the cause of the blaze. No injuries were reported. FRNSW reiterated a warning to owners of e-bikes and e-scooters not to charge them while sleeping, not to overcharge the batteries and not to block emergency exits. They also stressed to buy reputable lithium battery brands, to avoid cheap alternatives and to never mix and match components. Air New Zealand flight between Perth and Auckland forced to divert due to disruptive passenger An Air New Zealand flight bound for Auckland from Perth was forced to divert this morning after a passenger became disruptive, the airline has said. As AP reports, the flight landed instead in Melbourne, where police officers awaited the aircraft. The flight continued to Auckland after a 90-minute delay, Air New Zealand said in a statement. The carrier did not give more details about the episode. An airline spokesperson, David Morgan, said: Our crew managed the incident well, but incidents like this are distressing for our customers and our people and we have zero tolerance for this sort of behaviour on our aircraft. The diversion came less than a week after another Air New Zealand flight was held on the tarmac for two hours when it arrived in its destination, Sydney, after what the airline called a security incident. Local news outlets reported there had been a bomb threat. There was \u201cno threat to the community\u201d, the AFP said on Saturday. More on that Senate energy inquiry, where Matt Canavan put forward this point: \u201cI suppose the thing that perplexes me more than anything else is that we have probably per capita the greatest blessing of energy resources in the world, amazing resources of coal, of gas, and the world\u2019s largest uranium reserves. Yes, we have the sun as well,\u201d Canavan said (omitting wind, for some reason). And yet we now have left ourselves with a situation where the United States have power prices a third of ours. How have we allowed that to happen? Aemo officials didn\u2019t have an answer. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that today,\u201d the chief executive, Daniel Westerman, replied. There are actually a range of answers. A key one was the linking of the east coast Australian gas market to the global one a bit over a decade ago. As we noted a couple of years ago here, before that rather radical decision, gas prices were about $3 a gigajoule. Prices are more like $12/GJ now, if you can secure contracts, and have been a lot higher. And as gas-fired power plants often set the price in the whole electricity price market, our power prices have soared too. (The US has had curbs on gas exports, which have helped keep a lid on prices there. It\u2019s a policy approach applied in Western Australia through a reservation system for local use.) Senate inquiry scrutinises energy organisations \u2013 with a certain slant The Senate inquiry into energy planning and regulation has started today, kicking off with the Australian Energy Market Operator in the dock. (You can stream it here.) It\u2019s not quite clear what this inquiry will unearth, but its first session suggests the results might have a partisan bend. David Van, the committee chair \u2013 a former Victorian Liberal senator before he resigned to become an independent last June after denying accusations of inappropriate behaviour \u2013 has pressed AEMO on its integrated system plans. (See 2024 version here.) In short, Van and LNP senator Matt Canavan aren\u2019t happy the ISPs only examine the \u201cleast cost pathways\u201d to whatever policy settings are in place. Aemo doesn\u2019t consider, say, an energy system without a net zero goal by 2050. Van stated: It\u2019s not an economic test. It\u2019s not testing the productivity from an economic point of view that will contribute to the Australian economy. And Canavan, perhaps sailing towards a rocky shoal, asked: If we were to ask you, \u2018go and model this particular option, go and model nuclear, go and model no climate targets\u2019, would that be useful \u2026 information that you could produce for people? The answer was yes, Aemo\u2019s models can accommodate various inputs \u2013 provided they are actual policy. Should the Coalition win office and start implementing plans to build seven nuclear power plants, Aemo would recalculate its ISP. It would likely show a much more costly pathway than is presently put forward for the transition to net zero (assuming the latter remains policy). More on the King and Queen\u2019s departure from Australia A pool reporter has informed us that King Charles and Queen Camilla were farewelled by a small crowd of fans, plus the NSW deputy premier, Prue Car, the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, and the NSW governor, Margaret Beazley. The pair farewelled the Australian contingent for potentially the final time before heading up the steps on to the Royal Australian Air Force jet. They will travel to Samoa after spending a short five days in Australia with a packed itinerary, including a visit to Parliament House and the War Memorial in Canberra. The Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa is expected to discuss climate change, the impact of colonialism and reparations. King Charles and Queen Camilla are about to take off for Samoa, where the King will attend the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. Images are being broadcast of their plane circling the tarmac, preparing to take off. The royals made their way up the stairs and waved goodbye after their first official tour of Australia as King and Queen. Pay boost for workers to help fix \u2018broken\u2019 child protection New child-protection workers will be offered more than $8000 in higher pay to fill critical shortages in NSW and help fix a \u201cbroken\u201d system, AAP reports. More than 2,000 public-sector caseworkers will get a pay rise of at least 4% under the deal with the Public Service Association. But starting pay rates for new caseworkers will get a much-larger increase, rising by $8,283 in the current financial year. The NSW families minister, Kate Washington, said child-protection caseworkers have \u201cone of the most challenging and important jobs in the world: keeping vulnerable children safe\u201d. I have seen first-hand the incredible difference these workers make to children and families and I hope that this agreement will encourage more caseworkers to take up positions with [the government]. As part of the new agreement, all child-protection workers will receive a minimum 4% rise and a 0.5% superannuation bump, backdated to the start of July. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, will travel to Broken Hill tomorrow, AAP reports, after severe thunderstorms that wiped out powerlines and faulty generators left locals with minimal electricity for the better part of a week. Most residents currently have power, but some fear it could cut out again before the transmission infrastructure is fixed to reconnect the town to the national grid. A backup gas-fired generator has been offline for nearly a year, while a second one tripped on Monday under high power demand due to hot weather. Tom Kennedy, Broken Hill\u2019s mayor, believes Minns will face unsatisfied locals when he heads to the region. He told ABC RN earlier this morning: A lot of people in Broken Hill are just not happy, considering we shouldn\u2019t have gone through this. There should have been two generators that would ensure Broken Hill kept its power supply and also the outlying regions that have been several days without power at different times during this disaster. As we reported earlier, Minns said he had declared a natural disaster in Broken Hill to allow funds to flow, that \u201ccompensation for communities must happen\u201d and an investigation into how this occurred will take place. Fire danger period to begin next week for some areas of Victoria VicEmergency says that the fire danger period is \u201cfast-approaching\u201d and will be declared as soon as next week in some areas. In a post to X, it said it is \u201ccritical\u201d for those in high-risk locations to \u201cbe prepared for the coming fire season\u201d. CFA declares the fire danger period for each municipality (shire or council) at different times in the lead up to the fire season. It is declared during periods of increased fire risk considering local conditions. The fire danger period may be declared as early as October in some municipalities and typically remains in place until the fire danger lessens, which could be as late as May. In NSW the bushfire danger period runs from 1 October to 31 March. As we flagged earlier, King Charles is off to Samoa this morning for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in Apia. The Minderoo Foundation says it will be placing ads in the Samoan airport as delegates arrive showing a young child vomiting up plastic as part of its campaign for a global plastics treaty. The ads will be placed at the arrivals exit and baggage claim, as well as an external welcome screen, roadside and at a VIP airport terminal, it said, with geotargeted ads on social media as well. The foundation\u2019s director, Jay Weatherill, said Chogm was an \u201cideal place to ramp up advocacy\u201d for the treaty given that 33 of the world\u2019s 42 small states are Commonwealth members: Nine are from the Pacific. These small states are particularly vulnerable to issues such as climate change and the environmental and human health impacts being driven by plastic pollution \u2026 2.5 billion citizens live in Commonwealth countries, with more than 60% aged 29 or under. Our children deserve to have a future where their bodies are not involuntary riddled with dangerous chemicals stemming from plastic. Bureau of Meteorology testing tsunami warning system The Bureau of Meteorology says it will be testing its tsunami warning system from 11am to 4pm Aedt today. The tests will be marked as \u201cTEST\u201d and appear on the Bureau\u2019s website and weather app, it said. Queensland chief health officer \u2018concerned\u2019 about health harms of vapes Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, says he is concerned about the growing evidence of the health harms of vapes \u2013 including \u201cdamaged lungs, toxicity, seizures, poisoning and increasing evidence of adverse events on heart health\u201d. Addressing the Oceania tobacco control conference in Queensland being hosted by the Cancer Council, Gerrard said it is important not to forget the considerable harms to health that tobacco products, including cigarettes, continue to cause to Australians. While there has been considerable success in reducing the smoking rate across the country in recent years, I\u2019m concerned about the potential for the widespread sale of cheap, illicit tobacco products. As we gather at this conference, it\u2019s important to note that tobacco use is the cause of more preventable death and disease than any other modifiable health risk factor. We must whenever we do all we can to prevent smoking and assist current smokers to quit. Health minister addresses conference on tobacco and vaping reforms This morning the federal health minister, Mark Butler, addressed the Oceania tobacco control conference taking place on the Gold Coast, where he is speaking about the significant tobacco and vaping reforms introduced. Tobacco laws, regulations, instruments, and court decisions have been combined under one piece of legislation. \u201cTobacconists, vape shops and convenience stores can no longer sell vapes,\u201d he said in a video address to conference attenders, which includes leading researchers and clinicians in tobacco and vaping control from around the world. He said since January, more than 5m vapes had been seized at the border. We\u2019ve returned it to a therapeutic good, [with people] only being able to purchase a vape for smoking cessation at a pharmacy. From October, prescriptions are no longer required to get vapes from a pharmacy. But the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia told Guardian Australia that while the society does not have exact numbers, many pharmacists are choosing not to stock them because they don\u2019t want to provide an unregulated product to consumers. There are also mixed reports about the availability of vapes and the effectiveness of enforcement action so far. Despite harsher penalties now being available to prosecute vape suppliers, there are concerns regulators are still too frequently using softer enforcement measures and failing to deter retailers from continuing to sell. Since July this year, the TGA has issued 13 infringement notices totalling $244,410 against six companies for alleged offences in connection with the retail supply of vaping goods. Adam Bandt posts in solidarity with pro-refugee protesters who were disrupted by neo-Nazis As we reported earlier this morning, suspected neo-Nazis were pepper-sprayed by police in Melbourne after they tried to disrupt the final night of a 100-day protest in support of refugees. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has commented on the situation in a post to X and said: For 100 days a group of brave, peaceful protesters have sat outside the Department of Home Affairs calling for refugees to be given permanent visas. Last night neo-Nazis tried to disrupt them. Solidarity with all at the encampment for their tireless advocacy these past months. Union slams \u2018false hope\u2019 of nuclear plan and says jobs are at risk Queensland\u2019s sparkies have been warned of the \u201chuge risk\u201d to thousands of jobs in renewable energy posed by nuclear plans, AAP reports. The Electrical Trades Union has told electricians and apprentices in a mass mailout that nuclear energy was a \u201cradioactive pipe dream\u201d that could not replace coal-fired power stations. The union\u2019s national policy director, Katie Hepworth, says the \u201cfalse hope\u201d offered by the LNP on the premise that coal-powered stations can keep running is \u201cletting down coal communities\u201d: The ETU members, our maintenance workers, who work in these power stations know that they\u2019re being held together by all the will in the world, but they know they can\u2019t hold on forever. There is a huge risk that if what they\u2019re being given is a fantasy of a nuclear power station without an entire industrial plan and a renewable plan, that they\u2019re just going to be thrown on the scrap heap again. The union\u2019s nuclear energy report for 2024 found nuclear reactors would be more expensive, could not be built before coal exits the electricity grid and was \u201csimply unnecessary\u201d given abundant renewable energy sources. The report, authored by Dr Hepworth, found nuclear power would be the most expensive form of energy for Australia, at 1.5 to three times the cost per kilowatt hour of coal-fired electricity and four to eight times of solar. Woolworths and Coles front federal court amid claims of misleading discounts Supermarket giants Woolworths and Coles have appeared in the federal court for the first time since the competition regulator launched legal action against the companies for allegedly misleading customers with fake discounts. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) sued the supermarkets last month, alleging they had breached consumer law on hundreds of common supermarket products, Lawyers for the parties appeared in the federal court in Melbourne this morning for a case management hearing. John Sheehan KC, acting for Coles, said his client would show that price spikes were due to a request by suppliers for a price increase and during a period of a \u201csudden outbreak of inflation\u201d. He described the case as \u201csignificant for the industry as a whole.\u201d Cameron Moore SC, representing Woolworths, labelled the ACCC\u2019s case \u201cmisconceived\u201d. Sarida McLeod, representing the regulator, responded to the supermarket\u2019s responses, telling the court \u201cnone of this takes the ACCC by surprise\u201d: The conduct is still misleading. Justice Michael O\u2019Bryan said another case management hearing would be held at a date to be determined. Deputy Liberal leader also shoots down calls to put abortion on national agenda The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, has also shot down Jacinta Price\u2019s calls to put abortion on the national political agenda, saying the Liberal party has \u201cno intention\u201d to change federal rules on the issue. As mentioned earlier, Price \u2013 the shadow Indigenous Australians minister \u2013 told the Nine newspapers she \u201ccannot agree\u201d with late-term abortions, which she claimed was \u201canywhere past the [first] trimester as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2026 Full-term becomes infanticide\u201d. It comes as several states debate abortion issues, sparked by conservative politicians seeking to re-examine the issue. The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, this morning gave a categorical rebuttal, saying \u201ca Dutton led Coalition government has no plans, no policy and no interest in unwinding women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d Ley, the deputy Liberal leader and shadow minister for women, gave a similarly blunt response to Price\u2019s comments \u2013 twice saying the Liberals had no intention to change laws. She told Sky News: It\u2019s important to remember that access to abortion is a state issue, which is why you often see it debated at state level, and we have no intention to change the settings from a federal health perspective. Obviously, individuals have their own views, and Jacinta is entitled, as a member of the National Party, to her own view, but the federal Liberals have no intention of changing the settings when it comes to this issue. O\u2019Neil defends government spending amid latest inflation forecasts Today show host Karl Stefanovic grilled Clare O\u2019Neil on whether government spending would be cut, amid forecasts showing headline inflation rising from 3% at the end of this year to 3.7% by the end of next year. Peter Hannam had more on this earlier in the blog, here, with all the much-needed context. O\u2019Neil defended the government, saying inflation had \u201cmore than halved\u201d since it came to office and that the Coalition didn\u2019t deliver a surplus as promised while in government. But how does she feel about going to an election without a rate cut? O\u2019Neil responded that \u201cit\u2019s not about the politics\u201d and said: We\u2019re in a country right now where your kids and mine, Karl, are going to face totally different housing opportunities than \u2026 our parents got and that our grandparents got, and we can\u2019t put up with that. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing our government and state governments do so much about this problem. O\u2019Neil says she is not suggesting policy shift on stamp duty The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, made the rounds on breakfast television this morning and also spoke with the Today show about her comments that stamp duty was a \u201cbad tax\u201d. O\u2019Neil reiterated what she said to ABC earlier, saying that \u201cit\u2019s not a great tax\u201d and that \u201cpretty much every economist in the country would agree with agree with me when I say that.\u201d But the minister said she was not suggesting a policy shift for the states: What I\u2019m saying is an abject truth in this matter, and that this is not a great tax \u2026 That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing some states and territories do some things to try to wind it back \u2026 What I can tell you is that along with that, the states are doing some really big and important things about housing, massive changes in Victoria and NSW and Western Australia. So we\u2019re all trying to do what we can here to change the housing situation up for the millions of people affected by this. Royal tour of Australia wrapping up today King Charles and Queen Camilla are wrapping up their Australian tour today, set to leave for Samoa at 11.05am. Their next round of engagements will be at this year\u2019s Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in Samoa\u2019s capital, Apia, the king\u2019s first as head of the Commonwealth. We\u2019ll bring you more from their departure later in the morning. You can read about their final day of the Australian tour, yesterday, below: A teenager has been charged after alleged Nazi graffiti in Sydney\u2019s south yesterday. NSW police commenced an investigation after reports of offensive graffiti on driveways, gutters, and trees in the Gymea area yesterday. Police were told a male teenager had allegedly been seen marking property along Forest Road. Officers have since arrested a 15-year-old boy, who was taken to Sutherland police station and charged with knowingly displaying a Nazi symbol without excuse. He was refused bail to appear before a children\u2019s court today. Liberal frontbencher Jane Hume has declared the federal Coalition has \u201cno plan\u201d to wind back abortion laws in Australia if it wins government, dismissing it as an issue raised by \u201cfringe parties\u201d in the context of the Queensland election. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she has told Sky News. Hume\u2019s colleague and the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, Jacinta Price, has told Nine newspapers she cannot support abortion past the first trimester, calling full-term abortion \u201cinfanticide\u201d and elevating the issue beyond the current debates in Queensland and South Australia to the national political agenda. But Hume said abortion was a personal matter, the responsibility of state and territory governments and not an issue on the Coalition\u2019s reform agenda: It\u2019s not an issue for the federal government. In the Liberal party, it\u2019s always been an issue of conscience, too, and rightly so. There are some deeply held views right around the country and that is fine. That\u2019s why they call it choice. But what I can assure you and assure your viewers and assure all voters, is that a Dutton led Coalition government has no plans, no policy and no interest in unwinding women\u2019s reproductive rights. Hume described it as \u201can issue raised by fringe parties in a state election\u201d. It is not an issue for federal politics and there is no plan to change or unwind women\u2019s reproductive rights in Australia under a Coalition government. Hume was asked for her personal view on women\u2019s legal access to abortion, and said: \u201cI don\u2019t see the need to change the laws\u201d. In a five minute hearing the federal court has ruled Bruce Lehrmann will be allowed to continue his appeal after Justice Wendy Abraham stayed the costs order of $2m made by Justice Michael Lee. Abraham said Ten\u2019s application for a $200,000 security of costs order has been denied. She said: I order the interlocutory application of the respondent stated 21 June, 2024 be dismissed. Lee\u2019s order for Lehrmann to pay Ten $2m should be stayed \u201cuntil the appeal in the proceeding\u201d, Abraham said. Her reasons will follow after they have been published. The National Anti-Scam Centre says it has detected a new bulk extortion email campaign targeting Australians which is likely using personal details sourced from public data breaches. Scamwatch has received hundreds of reports throughout the past week, with people allegedly targeted by someone claiming to have compromising images or videos of them after hacking into their computer or webcam. The scammers then allegedly threaten to release the material if they are not paid cryptocurrency to a specified address. The emails allegedly include personal details of the recipients, the centre said in a statement, \u201clikely to have been sourced from previous public data breaches\u201d. There is no evidence that those behind the emails really do have access to people\u2019s webcam or computer, the centre said. The ACCC\u2019s deputy chair, Catriona Lowe, said \u201cpeople need to be especially alert to this emerging trend\u201d: The fictional threats in these emails combined with the inclusion of people\u2019s personal data are intended to terrify the individual reading it. It\u2019s extortion and it\u2019s a crime. People should ignore these spam emails and be aware that the recent volume of reports of this scam suggest it is a large-scale campaign. The National Anti-Scam Centre is working with partner organisations, including law enforcement and IDCARE, to disrupt this scam and ensure victims have access to support. QBE apologises for price \u2018inconsistencies\u2019 QBE Insurance has responded to the regulator\u2019s pursuit of the insurer in the federal court over allegations it misled customers, as we just flagged. The insurer said in a statement it had taken steps to address the \u201cinconsistencies in the delivery of premium price promises\u201d. QBE apologies for the inconsistencies. QBE will review the pleadings and continue to work with ASIC on these matters. Avoid hyperventilating about IMF (and other) inflation forecasts There\u2019s a bit of reporting around this morning about the International Monetary Fund\u2019s 2025 forecast for Australia\u2019s inflation being the second highest among advanced nations (behind Slovakia). (Eg, in the Australian and the AFR.) First up, the forecasts sound scary, such as headline inflation rising from 3% at the end of this year to 3.7% by the end of next year. That\u2019s not the direction we want to travel. However, that\u2019s hardly news. The Reserve Bank\u2019s August statement on monetary policy predicts the rate to rise from 3% to 3.7% over the comparable period. We\u2019re also well accustomed to the RBA\u2019s more lenient approach to bringing down inflation - the aim is to retain as many of the job gains as possible. (That part of the mandate is holding up perhaps a tad too well if you\u2019re hoping for an early interest rate cut.) Recall that headline consumer price inflation has been artificially lowered lately by energy and housing rebates. Now some of those won\u2019t be repeated \u2013 eg Queensland\u2019s $1000 per household handout on 1 July \u2013 but it remains highly likely that a federal government seeking reelection is going to offer some sort of rebates for next year (and the opposition will probably seek to match or exceed them). The RBA, of course, can\u2019t anticipate what those rebates will be so they don\u2019t include any. Hey presto, headline CPI rises next year. The central bank, of course, pays more attention to underlying inflation. On current forecasts, the trimmed mean measure will ease from 3.5% at year\u2019s end to 2.9% by December 2025. Those predictions will get updated ahead of the RBA\u2019s next board meeting on 4-5 November. On 30 October, we\u2019ll also have September quarter inflation data - the real numbers that we need to fuss about. The federal court will rule this morning on whether Bruce Lehrmann will be allowed to stay the costs order of $2m made by Justice Michael Lee in the defamation case. Lehrmann is appealing his defamation loss against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson but is unemployed and is unable to pay his legal costs. Justice Wendy Abraham will also rule on whether Ten\u2019s application for a $200,000 security of costs order has been successful. Lehrmann has argued there is a genuine public interest in allowing an appeal and a risk that if the security of costs is granted it may abort the appeal. In April, Lee found Lehrmann was not defamed by Wilkinson and Ten when The Project broadcast an interview with Brittany Higgins on 15 February 2021 in which she alleged she was raped by a staffer. Lee found on the balance of probabilities Lehrmann raped Higgins on a minister\u2019s couch in Parliament House in 2019. Lehrmann has always denied the rape allegation and pleaded not guilty at his criminal trial in the Australian Capital Territory supreme court which was aborted. Prosecutors did not seek a retrial due to concerns about Higgins\u2019s mental health. Funding for Indigenous students at boarding schools extended until end of 2026 The federal government has extended funding to Indigenous students at boarding schools until the end of 2026, after months of warnings young people in remote communities would miss out on education. The $43.2m investment will allow around 2,500 students to attend boarding schools and deliver \u201cwrap-around supports\u201d in addition to housing. Secondary schools and boarding providers that mainly support First Nations students from remote and very remote areas may be eligible to receive funding under the program. Graham Catt, the CEO of Independent Schools Australia, welcomed the announcement while noting it came after months of advocacy. These schools are more than just educational institutions \u2013 they provide cultural, emotional, and pastoral support to thousands of students from remote areas. But while a two-year extension is welcome, it\u2019s not a long-term fix. We need a sustainable funding model to provide certainty for these schools and the students they serve. Cheryl Salter, the executive director of the Association of Independent Schools of the Northern Territory, said many of these boarding schools were the only option for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in remote communities where access to secondary education was limited or nonexistent. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, said the investment would provide \u201ccritical support for First Nations boarding students\u201d while the government considered the outcomes of its Indigenous boarding design review. The corporate regulator is suing QBE Insurance over allegations it misled customers about the value of premium discounts offered for various home, contents and car insurance products. Sarah Court, the deputy chair of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), said some customers were promised discounts for their loyalty when renewing their policies which they didn\u2019t receive. Where insurers make discount promises to renewing customers, they need to have robust systems and controls in place to make sure their customers receive the discounts they were promised. Asic alleges QBE\u2019s pricing mechanisms, which include the use of algorithms, may have prevented the full value of the promised discounts being applied. The discounts were offered through more than 500,000 renewal notices to customers including retirees, QBE shareholders, and those holding multiple policies with the insurer, according to the regulator. The promised discounts were made in statements and renewal notices sent between July 2017 and September 2022, according to the regulator. ASIC has filed the court proceedings in the federal court and is pursuing penalties. QBE was contacted for comment. Moving to the Victorian government\u2019s rezoning plan for 50 affluent suburbs, Clare O\u2019Neil was asked if she agreed with comments from the premier, Jacinta Allan, that those opposed are Nimbys. She said the plan is \u201cbold and ambitious\u201d and affects her own electorate: What I say to people at home, we can\u2019t all complain about the housing crisis and talk about how much we care about the younger generation and then complain when it might affect us. So we do need to get that balance right. We need to see some change here. On the protest from Brighton residents at the weekend, O\u2019Neil said that \u201cstaging a protest before we\u2019ve got any real detail about this is a bit much\u201d: These are the same people who are complaining about housing options for their kid \u2026 We\u2019ve got a younger generation that [are facing] real difficulties here. To make a difference to them we need to see some changes \u2026 If we want to make sure we live in a fair country where young people get a good go at getting into home ownership, change has to happen. Housing minister clarifies comments that stamp duty is \u2018bad tax\u2019 Clare O\u2019Neil also clarified comments she made yesterday that stamp duty was a \u201cbad tax\u201d. She was asked about a report from the Business Council that has suggested states and territories replace stamp duty with a land tax, and said this was a \u201creally good idea\u201d because \u201cstamp duty is a bad tax\u201d, preventing people from \u201cmoving around the housing market in the way that suits them best\u201d. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has since outlined why the state will not scrap stamp duty despite agreeing with O\u2019Neil. Speaking this morning, O\u2019Neil said: I was actually, in those comments yesterday, commending something the Victorian state government has done, saying they\u2019ll make some limitations on stamp duty. It isn\u2019t a great tax. That being said, it\u2019s a matter for the states and I don\u2019t want to take away from the hugely bold and ambitious things the states are doing on housing. I\u2019ve got kids, I want them to grow up with good housing opportunities in this country. For the first time we\u2019ve got a Commonwealth government and states and territories all making big radical changes to change the way that housing works in our country and that\u2019s a really good thing for the next generation. Clare O\u2019Neil speaks on $26m fund for infrastructure in Sydney\u2019s south-west The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, was also up on ABC News Breakfast this morning to discuss the government\u2019s announcement of $26m to fund roads, sewerage, water and power for new homes in Sydney\u2019s south-west. We had more on this earlier in the blog, here. She was asked about the Coalition\u2019s announcement of $5bn for infrastructure, and argued \u201cthey\u2019re kind of copying our homework\u201d: This is just $26m of what is a much bigger sum of money \u2026 just part of the $32bn we\u2019re spending. O\u2019Neil argued that the opposition was planning to cut $19bn out of the money the government had committed to housing, and said the Coalition \u201cignored this problem for the ten years they were in office\u201d. Labor and the opposition have traded barbs over housing all morning. Earlier, Bridget McKenzie repeatedly told ABC RN the opposition had to \u201csolve the housing crisis of Labor\u2019s making\u201d. As of 4:30am this morning, all power has been restored to Broken Hill in western NSW. Thousands had been experiencing a prolonged power outage after severe thunderstorms last Thursday flattened transmission infrastructure, and backup generation tripped at on Monday, leaving homes in the dark again \u2013 and in sweltering 35C heat yesterday. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, was on ABC News Breakfast earlier and said load sharing would continue until 6 November \u2013 which means potentially \u201cmore power disruptions\u201d if the grid can\u2019t bear the load. There was a major weather event that ripped through six power lines that disconnected maintenance power from Broken Hill late last week. There should\u2019ve been a redundancy in place, there should\u2019ve been two gas generators to keep the lights on \u2026 I have declared a natural disaster in Broken Hill and that means the funds as well as the workers will be on site as soon as possible. Minns said it was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d acceptable that one of the backup generators has been out of action for nearly 12 months, and that \u201ccompensation for communities must happen\u201d: The number one priority is to get the electricity back on, number two is to get the town back on its feet. But we\u2019ll have an investigation as to how this happened and regional communities quite rightly feel let down. Qantas says industrial action not expected to impact customers As we flagged earlier, around 300 Qantas engineers are set to walk off the job for 24 hours from this morning. AAP reports that Qantas is not expecting the industrial action in Melbourne or Brisbane to have any impact on customers. A spokesperson said: There\u2019s been some industrial action by engineers since late September and so far we\u2019ve been able to successfully ensure it hasn\u2019t resulted in any flight delays or cancellations. The airline says the engineer\u2019s demands are unsustainable. Qantas said it has had meetings with the unions and wanted to find a way forward, but they had chosen to take action. Our preference is to reach an agreement that includes pay rises and other benefits. This includes annual pay increases, increased apprentice pay, as well as new career progression opportunities and more advanced training. Watch: the moment Lidia Thorpe was sworn in as senator Just circling back to those comments from Bridget McKenzie earlier, who argued Independent senator Lidia Thorpe had breached her oath of allegiance by protesting King Charles. When Thorpe was sworn in, in August 2022, she was told to repeat the oath of allegiance after she initially described the Queen as a coloniser. Speaking to ABC RN yesterday (see post), Thorpe said she had sworn allegiance \u201cunder duress\u201d and it was \u201ca very, very difficult thing to do as a Blak, sovereign woman.\u201d However, I was told that if I didn\u2019t do it, I couldn\u2019t be a senator to bring Blak issues into this space and around the world\u2026 You can watch the moment Thorpe was first sworn in as a senator below: NSW police have charged a man for allegedly vandalising a statue of Queen Victoria in Sydney\u2019s CBD. About 5.30am yesterday, police were called to the Queen Victoria Building over reports the statue had been vandalised. Officers established a crime scene and an investigation commenced, with assistance from the public order and riot squad. About 10pm last night a search warrant was executed at a home in Strathfield, with police allegedly locating and seizing paint bottles. A 26-year-old man was arrested at the home and taken to Burwood police station. He was charged with malicious damage and wearing a disguise with intent to commit an indictable offence, and granted conditional bail to appear before Burwood local court on 12 November. Bridget McKenzie was also asked about Lidia Thorpe\u2019s protest at King Charles\u2019 parliamentary reception on Monday, which she said raised some \u201cquite tricky constitutional questions\u201d for her. McKenzie said she wasn\u2019t suggesting \u201cwe shut down protest or silence debate\u201d, and noted Thorpe was not the only republican in the room or the \u201conly person that believes in treaty and truth telling\u201d. But she argued Thorpe should have taken the same approach as Greens leader Adam Bandt: He made a legitimate and potent protest by snubbing the event entirely \u2026 whereas Senator Thorpe, I think, is the only parliamentarian that I\u2019ve ever known to disavow their oath of allegiance to our sovereign and their heirs and successes according to law. What she did on Monday essentially breached \u2013 this is a question I think we actually need to investigate, because it\u2019s the first instance I\u2019ve ever actually experienced where a parliamentarian who\u2019s sworn that oath of allegiance has breached that oath of allegiance. And so what then is the consequence of that for our constitution? McKenzie says detached housing in outer suburbs most affordable for young people Do Teal MPs need to rethink the Victorian government\u2019s rezoning proposal and embrace it, given we have a housing crisis? Bridget McKenzie responded that we need to \u201cthrow the kitchen sink\u201d at addressing the housing crisis, arguing that \u201cdetached housing is the most affordable\u201d. If we\u2019re interested in those young families in particular who want to get a foot in the door, then the most affordable houses that we can build are actually detached housing in those outer suburbs. But what about exploring high-rise density? McKenzie said we need to \u201cabsolutely be looking at all solutions\u201d. Bridget McKenzie, the shadow infrastructure minister, was just on ABC RN where she was asked if the opposition would match Labor\u2019s housing commitments? She argued that their plan would \u201cget more houses built than Labor\u2019s plan\u201d and said: It\u2019s not about who\u2019s got more money \u2026 because it will be the private sector that\u2019s actually delivering the house and land packages around capital cities and regional capitals across the country. Asked again, how much less would the opposition spend on housing, she didn\u2019t state a figure but said: \u201cwhy should the taxpayer be building the houses?\u201d She was asked about Victoria\u2019s rezoning plan for 50 affluent suburbs, and argued that Teal MPs are the \u201cbiggest Nimby\u2019s in town at the moment\u201d \u2013 meaning \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d. They don\u2019t want transmission lines, wind towers, solar farms in their backyards, nor do they want to see their leafy suburbs \u2013 very affluent suburbs \u2013 make a contribution to the housing crisis. I think we need to take the politics out of it, and the Teals like to make a big play that they want to not play politics. Well, I don\u2019t see any greater political move from the Teals then saying, \u2018Look, can someone else help us \u2026 solve the housing crisis? Can we do that down the road in those peri-urban suburbs out in western Melbourne and Western Sydney?\u2019 Number of NSW residents who can\u2019t afford GP more than triples: Ncoss data New research from the NSW Council of Social Services shows the percentage of people who can\u2019t afford a GP visit has more than tripled across the state over four years. The report was commissioned by Ncoss and conducted by the University of Canberra, finding that patient experiences with health services \u2013 including GPs, specialists and dentists \u2013 in NSW had gone backwards since its 2020 report. NCoss\u2019s chief executive, Cara Varian, said the report \u201cillustrates that the health system is broken\u201d: When people can\u2019t afford the most fundamental medical care it leads to bad health outcomes and puts pressure on hospitals. The NSW and commonwealth governments must take urgent action to address these matters. The key statistics from the report include: A 246% surge in patients who delayed or didn\u2019t see a doctor due to cost. A 116% increase in patients who delayed or did not see a specialist due to cost across NSW. In regional areas, there was a 202% increase. A 47% increase in patients who felt GPs did not spend enough time with them. In regional areas there was a 63% increase. A 25% increase in the number of NSW patients delaying or not seeing a dentist due to cost. Ncoss is calling on the government to improve affordability and reduce out-of-pocket costs, particularly for vulnerable populations, and enhance healthcare access in regional areas. Around 300 Qantas engineers will walk off the job for 24 hours from this morning. Engine components maintenance engineers in Melbourne will strike from 9am Aedt, with a large rally expected at the city\u2019s Tullamarine airport international terminal from 10am. Brisbane heavy maintenance engineers will also strike from 1:30am Aest for 24 hours, with a large rally planned at the Brisbane international terminal from 9am. The Qantas Engineers\u2019 Alliance \u2013 a union alliance including the AMWU, the AWU, and the ETU \u2013 said further action was necessary after \u201cQantas management refused to return to the bargaining table and increase its previous offer\u201d. The current enterprise agreement expired at the end of June, and the union has put forward a wage claim of 5% a year, with a 15% first-year increase to compensate for 3.5 years of wage freezes and as an industry catch-up payment. The AMWU\u2019s national secretary, Steve Murphy, said union members were \u201cvoting overwhelmingly to escalate our industrial activities.\u201d Michael Wright, national secretary with the ETU, said that \u201cQantas needs to stop stalling, start showing their respect to these workers and pay them what they\u2019re worth\u201d. Daniel raises infrastructure concerns amid Victorian government rezoning plans Zoe Daniel was also asked about a proposal within her Victorian electorate for high-rise housing, having already raised concerns. The state premier, Jacinta Allan, has announced an overhaul of planning rules in 50 inner-Melbourne areas located near public transport, to allow for greater density: Daniel said she \u201cabsolutely\u201d supports more housing within her electorate, but accused the government of announcing its housing policies \u201con the front pages of these Sunday newspapers with no warning to local councils or communities, which causes residents concern and uncertainty about what the plan is\u201d: And I think that\u2019s really bad practice. In low-rise suburbs, to put on the front page of the paper that you\u2019re considering towers of up to 20-storeys adjacent to train stations \u2013 where there is nothing anything like that height, even barely half that height in the entire electorate \u2013 requires conversations with people, to bring them along and to say, \u2018well, this is actually what we plan to do\u2019. She also expressed concern over infrastructure demands, stating: \u201cWhere\u2019s the childcare? Where are the schools? Where\u2019s the healthcare? What are the transport impacts of that?\u201d None of those conversations \u2026 have been had, and they need to be had. More on news media bargaining code and funding of media publishers One of the committee\u2019s key recommendations was a digital platform levy on companies like Meta and Google, which some have described as a tech tax to fund public interest journalism. Does Zoe Daniel support this? She responded \u201cmaybe\u201d, and said whether it can be in the next budget is \u201creally a question around the technicalities of how you design it.\u201d So in parts of Europe, for example, there\u2019s a 2% digital services tax. You could look at a public interest journalism levy. The issue that we have fundamentally here is the \u2026 offshoring of the digital platform\u2019s profits, where currently they pay very little tax because they argue that they don\u2019t operate in Australia, even though they\u2019re getting this enormous profit yield of the advertising on their platforms. So that\u2019s another thing that has to be resolved within legislation in order to impose a tax. Daniel said that \u201ca tax won\u2019t solve anything\u201d and as a former journalist herself she is \u201csupportive of finding mechanisms to support media diversity\u201d: But simply imposing a tax and feeding [it] into media organisations \u2026 won\u2019t fix the issue if Meta continues to deprecate news content \u2013 that is, reduce the exposure of news content to its consumers. Zoe Daniel on reignited news media bargaining code fight As Josh Butler and Amanda Meade have reported, social media company Meta has accused a federal parliamentary committee of ignoring \u201cthe realities of how our platforms work\u201d and the value Facebook and Instagram bring to news outlets. This comes as a fight reignites over the news media bargaining code and funding of media publishers: Zoe Daniel, the Independent MP for Goldstein, was on ABC radio earlier this morning to discuss this and said there was \u201csome irony\u201d in platforms arguing the committee was not acknowledging how they work, because \u201cwe have so little transparency around how their platform operates\u201d. In fact, that\u2019s probably the main thing that we heard during the extensive committee hearings that we\u2019ve done so far. But we simply don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on under the hood with these digital platforms, and until we allow digital researchers access to actually understand the algorithms, we won\u2019t be able to resolve issues around either social media harm and the various social issues that that\u2019s causing, and also what impact that\u2019s having on the way that news content is distributed to Australians. Footage emerges of Queensland LNP leader promising \u2018conscience vote\u2019 on abortion, despite assertions Confusion around the abortion policy of Queensland opposition leader David Crisafulli remains today after footage of an interview from last year shows him suggesting there would a \u201cconscience vote\u201d on the issue if he won power. That appears to contradict his repeated assertion on the campaign trail that there would be no changes to abortion laws despite pressure to do so from rightwing minority parties. Our full story explains the significance of the footage: Full Story: the \u2018doomsday\u2019 cult The Shincheonji church is an international Christian sect which started in South Korea. The group is being accused of bizarre recruitment strategies at a number of Australian universities and former members have made allegations of \u201ccoercive control\u201d tactics that include love bombing and sleep deprivation. Medical editor Melissa Davey speaks to Reged Ahmad about the experiences of families of current members, as well as former members, about life on the inside of this alleged \u201cdoomsday cult\u201d. Supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths are headed to their first court appearance since being accused of tricking customers with fake discounts, AAP reports. Both supermarkets will face the federal court today accused of violating consumer law by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which says they misled shoppers on hundreds of popular supermarket items with their \u201cDown Down\u201d and \u201cPrices Dropped\u201d campaigns. The alleged fake discounts included on dairy, pet food, personal care, coffee, medicine, lollies, cereal and household cleaning products. The ACCC began separate proceedings against Woolworths Group Ltd and Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd in September. At the time, the ACCC\u2019s chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, alleged both supermarkets used similar ploys to increase prices of hundreds of products before dropping them as part of their respective campaigns. The products sold for less than the inflated prices, but still more than the regular price that applied before the price spike. The ACCC said, if successful, it would seek a significant penalty for the alleged breaches of consumer law. Coles said it would defend the court proceedings, while Woolworths said its Prices Dropped program was introduced to give shoppers \u201cgreat everyday value\u201d on products. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties. Thanks to Martin Farrer for getting things started this morning. I\u2019ll be with you for most of the day as we bring you our rolling coverage. You can reach out via X (@emilywindwrites) or email (emily.wind@theguardian.com) with any thoughts, tips or feedback. Let\u2019s go. Bruce Lehrmann\u2019s appeal verdict due today An impoverished Bruce Lehrmann is about to find out if an appeal of his defamation loss is over or he can continue fighting in court, AAP reports. Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson have asked for federal court orders that he pay $200,000 in security in the event he loses his appeal. The former Liberal staffer opposed this move. He has also asked Justice Wendy Abraham to stay orders he pay $2m in legal costs to Ten, as well as an as-yet unknown bill for Wilkinson\u2019s defence costs. The judge is scheduled to hand down her decision today. She heard on 14 October Lehrmann was living on Centrelink benefits and his lawyer described him in court as \u201cpretty much unemployable\u201d. Ten has already served a bankruptcy notice on Lehrmann but agreed not to take any further steps until the appeal is resolved. Suspected neo-Nazis were pepper-sprayed by police in Melbourne last night after they tried to disrupt the final night of a 100-day protest in support of refugees. Protesters supporting a campaign for refugees to be given permanent visas had gathered in Docklands for a peaceful protest. But a few dozen black-clad counterprotesters turned up at the scene and chanted \u201cwhite power\u201d and \u201chail victory\u201d, David Glanz, a spokesperson for the Refugee Action Collective, told the Age. Police formed a line and pushed the counterprotesters back, pepper-spraying them and forcing them to retreat. The Albanese government has announced it will set aside $26m to fund roads, sewerage, water and power for new homes in Sydney\u2019s south-west as part of its broader $32bn housing commitments. The move comes after the opposition announced, if elected, it would deliver $5bn to build critical infrastructure required for new homes in undeveloped land, known as greenfield sites. The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, said the funding would help progress the Bonnyrigg renewal project which will provide 65 new social homes and 210 private residential lots. The Albanese government\u2019s housing support program will deliver $500m in funding for state, territory and local governments to build enabling infrastructure until mid-2025 with a further $1bn set aside for social housing. Under the Coalition\u2019s plan, $5bn in funding in the form of grants and concessional loans would go to industry, local councils and state utilities to build enabling infrastructure like water, power and sewerage. Up to 500,000 homes could be built on mostly undeveloped outer suburb or regional lands, the opposition claimed, and if a development did not progress within 12 months of receiving the funding its grant or loan would be terminated. It also proposed to freeze any changes to national building codes for 10 years, claiming the updates \u2013 such as those requiring new homes to meet higher energy efficiency standards \u2013 have added thousands of dollars to housing prices. O\u2019Neil said: We have an ambitious plan to build 1.2m homes over the next 5 years, unlocked by billions of dollars of investment in roads, sewerage, water and power right across Australia ... Peter Dutton\u2019s infrastructure announcement is a road to nowhere, pushing Australians to live hours away from their families and from their work.

We\u2019re not robots, we\u2019re humans,\u201d says one Woolworths warehouse worker about new working arrangements to eliminate \u201ctime-wasting\u201d seen by staff as a \u201cbullying\u201d tactic. We have spoken to several workers who are pushing back at the new framework introduced by the supermarket giant in the name of efficiency but which workers describe as unsafe. It comes as Woolworths joins Coles in facing the federal court today, accused of violating consumer law by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which says they misled shoppers about discounts. More on that soon. Suspected neo-Nazis were pepper-sprayed by police in Melbourne last night after they tried to disrupt the final night of a 100-day protest in support of refugees. More details coming up. And how to dispose of used solar panels has become a major headache for Australia\u2019s renewable industry. For a range of reasons, panels that could operate for 20 to 30 years are being pulled off rooftops and solar farms after 10 or 12 years, causing a \u201cstaggering\u201d number to end up in landfill. But there is some hope as Petra Stock visits a company in Brisbane that is finding ways to make money from unwanted panels.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email It comes as several states debate abortion issues, sparked by conservative politicians seeking to re-examine the issue: abortion is featuring heavily in the Queensland state election; and South Australia\u2019s parliament narrowly rejected a motion last week which would have wound back abortion care. Ley, the deputy Liberal leader and shadow spokesperson for women, twice said on Wednesday the Liberals were not planning to address abortion laws. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that access to abortion is a state issue, which is why you often see it debated at state level, and we have no intention to change the settings from a federal health perspective,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cObviously, individuals have their own views, and Jacinta is entitled, as a member of the National party, to her own view, but the federal Liberals have no intention of changing the settings when it comes to this issue.\u201d Hume told Sky: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue for the federal government. In the Liberal party, it\u2019s always been an issue of conscience, too, and rightly so. There are some deeply held views right around the country and that is fine. That\u2019s why they call it choice.\u201d McKenzie told ABC Radio National that she accepted Price had strong views on the issue, but reiterated that it was not a federal issue. Asked for her views on the matter, McKenzie said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful.\u201d Canavan, who has described himself as \u201cpro-life\u201d, said \u201cI don\u2019t think this is an issue best prosecuted through the heat of an election campaign.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be gained by playing it out in a tit-for-tat type process,\u201d he told a press conference on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a really sensitive issue for people and I really feel for young mums who have been through this \u2026 I\u2019m not ever going to have to experience that, I don\u2019t think that says you can\u2019t have a view on it, but I do try and be sensitive about it, but I\u2019m not the one trying to raise this.\u201d The federal health minister, Mark Butler, also stressed it was a state responsibility, and noted the Labor government had improved access to non-surgical abortions by removing restrictions. \u201cI am committed to ensuring that all Australian women have equitable access to the healthcare they need, particularly women in rural and regional areas and those experiencing disadvantage,\u201d he said in a statement. But Larissa Waters, the Greens spokesperson on women, said she was \u201cappalled\u201d that politicians were debating women\u2019s right to choose. \u201cAbortion is healthcare, and that\u2019s a national issue, so what we should be talking about is how to make abortions affordable and accessible for everyone \u2013 not restricting the legal right to choose,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous that anyone would propose forcing someone to go through with an unplanned pregnancy against their wishes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to have an abortion, don\u2019t have one, but you don\u2019t get to tell other women what choices they should have.\u201d",

Beck instructed Cambridge\u2019s ground staff to let the grass grow long in the corners of the Abbey Stadium pitch, so that the ball would sit up on the turf when the U\u2019s got it launched to their wingers \u2026 who would, in turn, supply their potent old-school front pairing of Dion Dublin and John Taylor.</p> <p>The U\u2019s manager was also not averse to holding training sessions in the middle of the pitch to help churn it up, better to thwart opponents that sought to pass it through midfield. It was all part of his attempts at marginal gains long before anyone had heard of Dave Brailsford. Other stunts included turning up the heating in the away dressing room until it was unbearably warm, putting their warm-up balls in the bath so they were heavy with wetness and piling undrinkable amounts of sugar into their tea. \u201cEvery single thing you\u2019ve heard from that time was true,\u201d Dublin told the Cambridge News <a href=\"https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/sport/every-single-thing-youve-heard-13975380\">in 2017</a>.</p> <p>Beck\u2019s antics evidently did not go unnoticed, as Mark Hughes instructed the Millennium Stadium ground staff to similarly let the grass grow on the wings, and narrow the pitch before his Wales side faced Brazil in a friendly in 2000. It didn\u2019t work, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/24/newsstory.sport2\">Brazil won 3-0</a>. But narrowing the pitch for perceived tactical advantage has a longer history, Graeme Souness tried it when Rangers took on Dynamo Kyiv in 1987-88 during his famously combative stint as manager at Ibrox. It paid dividends too, Rangers overcoming a 1-0 deficit to beat Valeriy Lobanovskiy\u2019s celebrated side 2-1 on aggregate.</p>    <p>A little less subtle were the antics of Patrik Gunnarsson, goalkeeper for the Norwegian side Viking, who in 2022 was caught on video <a href=\"https://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2022/05/31/6296828446163f45948b4616.html\">pulling the goalposts off the ground and closer together</a>, once the assistant referee had completed his pre-match checks. Perhaps he learned the trick from Kim Christensen, with the Gothenburg goalkeeper pictured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/25/kim-christensen-admits-moving-goalposts\">nudging the goalposts out of position</a> before the game to make his goal less than the regulation eight yards in width. \u201cI got the tip from a goalkeeping friend a few years ago, and since then I have done it from time to time,\u201d Christensen brazenly admitted.</p> <p>And, of course, there is also the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/13/theknowledge.sport\">the classic Knowledge question</a> about Halifax Town and their apocryphal flamethrower. <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">Any more for any more</a>?</p> <h2><strong>Delivering on stands</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201cExeter City\u2019s FA Cup date with Barnet means a stand derby: the Bees sold part of the Hive to the Grecians as part of the redevelopment of St James Park,\u201d</strong> notes Stephen Joseph. <strong>\u201cHave any other clubs sold parts of their ground to another?\u201d</strong></p> <p>Paul Levay has an answer in the form of Port Vale. \u201cAfter Chester City were turfed out of their old Sealand Road ground in the late-1980s, the roof of their main stand found its way to Vale Park, where it was installed in 1992 and, as far as I know, remains today. The mastermind behind this piece of engineering shenanigans was Vale\u2019s then-chairman and local used-car dealer Billy Bell. The stand at the Hamil Road End has had numerous sponsorships and name changes over the years, including a recent swap from the away to the home end, but to fans of a certain generation it will always be affectionately known, ahem, in the chairman\u2019s honour.</p> <p>\u201cThe 1990s were the best period in Vale\u2019s recent history because of the partnership between Bell and legendary manager John Rudge. It\u2019s appropriate you should ask the question this week as, on Monday, a statue in Rudge\u2019s honour was unveiled outside the Hamil Road End of the ground. In fact, if you look closely in some of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xez5kl0jlo\">photos from the ceremony</a> you can even see the remains of the Sealand Road roof. Further pictures of the roof are <a href=\"https://chesterfootballhistory.com/tag/port-vale/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.onevalefan.co.uk/2012/06/hamil-end-pictorial-history/\">here</a>.\u201d</p>    <p>But there\u2019s more. \u201cThis seems to happen in Scotland more than England,\u201d reckons Jim McEleny. \u201cGreenock Morton bought a stand roof (which was never put back up) and two floodlights (still in use) <a href=\"https://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/sport/19617082.morton-sell-roof-st-mirrens-old-love-street-stadium-12-years-buying-rivals/\">from St Mirren</a> when they left their Love Street ground. St Mirren\u2019s original floodlights (not the aforementioned) came from Ibrox Park as part of a transfer deal with Rangers. Auchinleck Talbot bought a stand when Hamilton Accies left their \u2018old\u2019 Douglas Park ground and took some time to re-erect it as (legend has it that no one recorded what part went where during dismantling). Kilwinning Rangers picked up floodlights from York City\u2019s Bootham Crescent ground and I\u2019m sure they\u2019d previously got them from Manchester United\u2019s old training ground.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Probably99/status/1846750250330997111\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There will be a  second &#39;Stand Derby&#39; on the same weekend of this year&#39;s FA Cup 1st Round when Maidstone United (5th round last year) play Solihull Moors.

It was his second goal for American Samoa and put him jointly top of the national team\u2019s scoring charts with Ramin Ott. Luani, who was 17 years, three months and 19 days old on the day of the Cook Islands match, had scored his first international goal two days earlier, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/26/american-samoa-first-victory\">the famous 2-1 win over Tonga</a> in 2014 World Cup qualifying.

The stand at the Hamil Road End has had numerous sponsorships and name changes over the years, including a recent swap from the away to the home end, but to fans of a certain generation it will always be affectionately known, ahem, in the chairman\u2019s honour. \u201cThe 1990s were the best period in Vale\u2019s recent history because of the partnership between Bell and legendary manager John Rudge. It\u2019s appropriate you should ask the question this week as, on Monday, a statue in Rudge\u2019s honour was unveiled outside the Hamil Road End of the ground. In fact, if you look closely in some of the photos from the ceremony you can even see the remains of the Sealand Road roof. Further pictures of the roof are here and here.\u201d But there\u2019s more. \u201cThis seems to happen in Scotland more than England,\u201d reckons Jim McEleny. \u201cGreenock Morton bought a stand roof (which was never put back up) and two floodlights (still in use) from St Mirren when they left their Love Street ground. St Mirren\u2019s original floodlights (not the aforementioned) came from Ibrox Park as part of a transfer deal with Rangers. Auchinleck Talbot bought a stand when Hamilton Accies left their \u2018old\u2019 Douglas Park ground and took some time to re-erect it as (legend has it that no one recorded what part went where during dismantling). Kilwinning Rangers picked up floodlights from York City\u2019s Bootham Crescent ground and I\u2019m sure they\u2019d previously got them from Manchester United\u2019s old training ground.\u201d Haaland \u2026 denied? \u201cErling Haaland has become Norway\u2019s top scorer aged 24,\u201d posts Ben Jones. \u201cSurely a record in the modern era?\u201d Jack Hayward has come in hot with this one. \u201cAs far as I can tell, the player to have become the top goalscorer for a national team at the youngest age is Shalom Luani. Better known for his career in the NFL now, Luani played football in his native American Samoa before moving to the United States to study and play gridiron. \u201cOn 24 November 2011, Luani scored in a 1-1 draw with the Cook Islands. It was his second goal for American Samoa and put him jointly top of the national team\u2019s scoring charts with Ramin Ott. Luani, who was 17 years, three months and 19 days old on the day of the Cook Islands match, had scored his first international goal two days earlier, in the famous 2-1 win over Tonga in 2014 World Cup qualifying. Ott has since scored a third for the country and still holds the national team record, jointly with Samuel Hayward.\u201d Swede nightmares \u201cIn this season\u2019s Women\u2019s Division 4 in Sweden, \u00c4ngelholms FF didn\u2019t just go the whole season unbeaten, but they also didn\u2019t concede a single goal \u2026 yet they still finished as runners up,\u201d flags Derek Robertson. \u201cThey much surely be the unluckiest \u2013 and \u2018best\u2019 \u2013 runners up of all time?\u201d Those three draws cost \u00c4ngelholm, as Ljungbyhed remarkably pipped them to promotion. \u00c4ngelholm (P18 W15 D3 L0 F78 A0) are now embroiled in a playoff to potentially go up after all, taking on Str\u00f6velstorps GoIF/IF Salamis from the tier above. The first leg finished \u2026 1-1 after visitors Str\u00f6velstorps GoIF/IF Salamis grabbed an equaliser in the 87th minute. Good luck in the return leg, \u00c4ngelholm! They wouldn\u2019t, however, be the first team denied despite an unbeaten season. Knowledge archive \u201cFootballers are not generally known for their intelligence, and upon reading about David Wetherall, a hero of my childhood, I learned that he attained a BSc in chemistry from the University of Sheffield,\u201d began Karl Corrick in January 2012. \u201cHave any other professional footballers gained degrees, putting paid to the thick-footballer stereotype?\u201d Honorary degrees don\u2019t count here \u2013 Alan Shearer has one, for example \u2013 but even without them the list of footballers who have donned the cap and gown is longer than you might think. The aforementioned Wetherall got a first in chemistry, an achievement that former Everton and Wales dog of war Barry Horne matched at the University of Liverpool. The late S\u00f3crates was a doctor of medicine and philosophy, while the former Ipswich, Watford, QPR and MK Dons defender Steve Palmer has a degree in software engineering from Cambridge. \u201cIt was a bit of a novelty for the media when I started but once you cross the line into professional sport you are judged on nothing but your performance,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cMy ability to study was perhaps due to the same attributes that allowed me to learn the game.\u201d Other bright sparks include Steve Heighway (economics), Slaven Bilic (law), Shaka Hislop (mechanical engineering), Iain Dowie (a masters in engineering), Steve Coppell (economics), Richard Hinds (law, Open University), Ars\u00e8ne Wenger (economics), Gudni Bergsson (law) and Oliver Bierhoff (economics). Update: To this list can now be added Karou Mitoma (dribbling), Giorgio Chiellini (masters in business administration), Stuart Armstrong (law), Romelu Lukaku (public relations and tourism), Simon Mignolet (law and political science), Juan Mata (marketing, then sports science), Mary Earps (management and business studies), Gerard Piqu\u00e9 (masters in business), Duncan Watmore (economics and business management), Vincent Kompany (MBA), Andr\u00e9s Iniesta (physical activity and sports sciences, then biology), Edwin van der Sar (sports and brand management), and presumably various others we\u2019ve missed. Can you help? \u201cWith seven London teams and three on the south coast, is this season the least \u2018northern\u2019 in English top-flight history?\u201d asks Tim P. \u201cWhich team in the Premier League era has the worst record in lunchtime kick-offs?\u201d wonders Steve Butler. \u201cAs a West Ham fan, this question occurred to me around 2pm on Saturday.\u201d \u201cWhile on loan at Peterborough from Rotherham last season, Peter Kioso was made club captain,\u201d mails Cameron McGlone. \u201cIs this a common occurrence? What other examples are there of players being made captain (permanently, not just for a game) while on loan?\u201d \u201cConsidering the starting lineup for West Ham against Tottenham, only one starting player had a shirt number in single figures,\u201d writes Paul Turner. \u201cHas a Premier League starting lineup ever been fielded with all players having double-digit squad numbers and what is the largest aggregate number of a starting lineup (West Ham comes in at 241) if you added all squad numbers together?\u201d Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU",

He is five generations back on Welby\u2019s side, six on mine. It is not as wildly unlikely as you may think \u2013 at six removes we all have 128 grandparents. But this particular historical figure is significant because of what he and tens of thousands of British people like him did \u2013 the fallout of which is still dividing and toxifying society today.</p> <p>Welby\u2019s statement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/22/archbishop-of-canterbury-justin-welby-reveals-ancestral-links-to-slavery\">confessing Fergusson\u2019s slave-owning past</a> shows he may not know much about our shared forefathers. So here is some detail. Fergusson and the generation before him were owners of enslaved Black people in Jamaica and, for a while, Tobago. There were 160 to 200 people at any one time at the Jamaican sugar plantation Rozelle, with 75 at Bloody Bay in Tobago.</p> <p>It was an ongoing massacre. In the worst years, more than 20% of the adults died, mostly from disease and violence; infant deaths were so common they were not recorded. Before 1807, the year shipping humans from Africa was abolished, Caribbean planters found it was more economically beneficial to work a person to death rather than look after them. The British transported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/descendants-of-uk-slave-owners-call-on-government-to-apologise#:~:text=the%20transportation%20of%203.1%20million%20enslaved%20African%20people\">3.1 million Africans</a> across the Atlantic \u2013 when slavery was abolished, after 250 years, there were 800,000 enslaved people remaining. </p> <p>The Fergussons were quite ordinary, small-scale enslavers \u2013 far less significant in wealth than the bankers and insurers. What our ancestors did was legal, of course, actively encouraged by British governments for the considerable tax revenues. Fergusson\u2019s uncle, Sir Adam Fergusson, sat as an MP, voting for the navy and army to protect his West Indies interests, just as he voted against William Wilberforce\u2019s attempts to abolish the \u201cslave trade\u201d in the 1790s. Sir Adam and his brother dabbled in shipping kidnapped people from modern Ghana to the Caribbean themselves.</p> <p>When it was clear that trade would eventually be banned, Sir Adam encouraged his managers to buy more young women so he could breed new workers, just as you breed farm animals. That failed. The teenagers died or failed to produce nearly as many children as he had hoped. He became very cross (I have read his letters to his managers at the plantation in Tobago).</p> <p>But the most important point I would make to cousin Justin is that this was entirely racist. Our Christian ancestors could not legally or morally have enslaved a white person. For their consciences, they had to make Black people not human at all. All the enslaved people had their African names erased and replaced with the sort you might attach to a pet dog. They rejected moves to baptise or educate them \u2013 that would be to acknowledge their humanity. In Tobago, the Fergussons branded their \u201cproperty\u201d with a logo made of their entwined initials.</p> <p>Welby has not held back on the church\u2019s complicity. The Church of England committed a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.anglicandioceseja.org/?p=29835\">vile and disgusting sin</a>\u201d, he said in a sermon in Jamaica in July, not just in the moral support it gave the enslavers but in profiting itself. Some archbishops did so directly. Welby said: \u201cWe are deeply, deeply, deeply sorry.\u201d</p>    <p>Over 250 years, many enslavers put a slice of their wealth into the church\u2019s collection plate. Were they seeking atonement? Welby has pushed for those donations to be acknowledged and for the soon-to-be-launched Church Commissioners\u2019 <a href=\"https://hrjfund.org/\">reparative justice fund</a> \u2013 all in a storm of vicious criticism from the right wing in the church. \u201cWoke Welby\u201d and even \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/news/church-england-religion-justin-welby-christian\">anti-Christian</a>\u201d are some of the insults thrown at him. The abuse from Telegraph-reading Anglicans hurts him more than it should, but it is the establishment into which he was born and educated.</p> <p>But Welby has admitted his connections. And now he must go further. Apology and acknowledgment lead logically to support for calls for reparations, in the Caribbean, West Africa and here. It\u2019s a progression that many families with this story, from Britain and other enslaving nations of Europe, have embraced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/19/history-caribbean-slavery-king-charles-commonwealth-summit\">The history of Caribbean slavery is being lost.

How could he affect election results?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What does Musk want around the world?</strong></h2> <p>Musk\u2019s fight for fewer government agencies is not limited to the US, though. Sometimes, his fights with \u201cthe regulators\u201d set him against other billionaires. In India, Musk is fighting with the government over the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/musk-reacts-ambani-lobbying-calls-any-india-move-auction-satellite-spectrum-2024-10-15/\">distribution of satellite broadband</a> and emerging victorious over Mukesh Ambani. Asia\u2019s richest man had sought terms more favorable to his own telecommunications empire.</p> <p>He has proclaimed himself a \u201cfree-speech absolutist\u201d and complained about the regulators of speech. When the UK was in the throes of violent race riots a month after its general election, Musk tweeted, \u201cCivil war is inevitable,\u201d and posted a cartoon showing a character in an electric chair, claiming that this would be the government\u2019s punishment for free speech in the UK by 2030. He has made similar critiques of the California government and Joe Biden\u2019s administration.</p> <p>His fight for deregulation regularly pits him against the judiciary in whichever country where he\u2019s operating. Last month, Brazil blocked access to X over its failure to comply with a judge\u2019s orders and then fined Starlink, a subsidiary of SpaceX, for its sister company\u2019s transgressions. Musk and X <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/08/musks-x-reinstated-in-brazil-after-complying-with-supreme-court-demands\">eventually acquiesced</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Are the regulators fighting back against Musk?</strong></h2> <p>Recently, some of the regulators have taken a new tack: they\u2019re starting to penalize one Musk company for what another Musk company (or Musk himself) does.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/election-elon-musk-trump-pennsylvania\">Conspiracy theories and a $1m check: a night at Elon Musk\u2019s surreal election giveaway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week, Europe\u2019s regulators took a page out of Brazil\u2019s book, communicating to lawyers at X that the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-17/musk-s-empire-risks-being-targeted-by-eu-for-potential-x-fines?sref=fqqmZ8gi\">EU could levy fines</a> against the social media company for failing to comply with the Digital Services Act. Crucially, the regulators suggest calculating that tax not just based on X\u2019s revenues, but the total revenue of Musk\u2019s businesses. The penalty, presumably much higher, could financially hobble the social media platform.</p> <p>In California, a coastal commission cited Musk\u2019s propensity to tweet misinformation during a vote to reject a petition by SpaceX and the US air force to launch more rockets from a base on a Santa Barbara beach. Musk sued in response, alleging political bias and first amendment violations.

Rachel and Nick write: These constant fights with the full alphabet of regulatory agencies has coincided with Musk making numerous public statements in favor of deregulation, as well as calling for a full-scale audit of the federal government. That idea has found purchase with Trump, who announced in September that he would launch a Musk-led government efficiency commission that would audit federal agencies for places to cut. Musk wants to call it the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, invoking one of his favorite memes, an expressive shiba inu. Although the plan is vague on details and fails to address the obvious conflict of interest in Musk auditing the regulators that oversee his companies, both Trump and Musk have repeatedly brought up the idea of Musk holding some role in a potential Trump administration. During an appearance on Fox News earlier this week, Trump said that he would create a new position called \u2018secretary of cost-cutting\u2019 and appoint Musk. \u2018He\u2019s dying to do this,\u2019 Trump said. What does Musk want around the world? Musk\u2019s fight for fewer government agencies is not limited to the US, though. Sometimes, his fights with \u201cthe regulators\u201d set him against other billionaires. In India, Musk is fighting with the government over the distribution of satellite broadband and emerging victorious over Mukesh Ambani. Asia\u2019s richest man had sought terms more favorable to his own telecommunications empire. He has proclaimed himself a \u201cfree-speech absolutist\u201d and complained about the regulators of speech. When the UK was in the throes of violent race riots a month after its general election, Musk tweeted, \u201cCivil war is inevitable,\u201d and posted a cartoon showing a character in an electric chair, claiming that this would be the government\u2019s punishment for free speech in the UK by 2030. He has made similar critiques of the California government and Joe Biden\u2019s administration. His fight for deregulation regularly pits him against the judiciary in whichever country where he\u2019s operating. Last month, Brazil blocked access to X over its failure to comply with a judge\u2019s orders and then fined Starlink, a subsidiary of SpaceX, for its sister company\u2019s transgressions. Musk and X eventually acquiesced. Are the regulators fighting back against Musk? Recently, some of the regulators have taken a new tack: they\u2019re starting to penalize one Musk company for what another Musk company (or Musk himself) does. Last week, Europe\u2019s regulators took a page out of Brazil\u2019s book, communicating to lawyers at X that the EU could levy fines against the social media company for failing to comply with the Digital Services Act. Crucially, the regulators suggest calculating that tax not just based on X\u2019s revenues, but the total revenue of Musk\u2019s businesses. The penalty, presumably much higher, could financially hobble the social media platform. In California, a coastal commission cited Musk\u2019s propensity to tweet misinformation during a vote to reject a petition by SpaceX and the US air force to launch more rockets from a base on a Santa Barbara beach. Musk sued in response, alleging political bias and first amendment violations. He just wants to be left alone to launch rockets and tweet and spend tens of millions on the presidential election in peace.",

      "bodyText": "John Pesutto\u2019s lawyer has rejected claims the Victorian Liberal leader created a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in order to expel Moira Deeming, telling a court he acted to \u201ccauterise the damage\u201d after neo-Nazis gatecrashed a rally the MP helped organise. Deeming, who now sits on the crossbench after her expulsion from the state parliamentary Liberal party, is suing Pesutto for allegedly falsely portraying her as a Nazi sympathiser after she spoke at the Let Women Speak rally held on 18 March 2023, which was gatecrashed by neo-Nazis. Pesutto has denied the claim. In her closing arguments, Deeming\u2019s barrister, Sue Chrysanthou SC, asserted that Pesutto\u2019s push to expel her from the party had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the rally. \u201cThe decision to expel was so irrational and clearly not based on the reasons he put forward to the press,\u201d Chrysanthou told the federal court in Melbourne. \u201cMrs Deeming was expelled because Mr Pesutto found it annoying to have to answer press questions about her whenever she made a statement about sex-based rights.\u201d She said Pesutto believed he lost his seat of Hawthorn at the 2018 election due to the Liberals\u2019 focus on \u201cnon-mainstream issues\u201d \u2013 such as \u201cthe ones Mrs Deeming talks about\u201d \u2013 and argued he created a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that the MP \u201cassociates with Nazis\u201d to \u201cas a pretext to just get rid of her\u201d. But Pesutto\u2019s lawyer, Matthew Collins KC, emphatically rejected Chrysanthou\u2019s theory, describing it as a \u201cconspiracy\u201d that was not put to either Pesutto or the Liberal leadership team in cross-examination nor explored in evidence. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201c[She] presented a very extreme political problem for the alternative government \u2026 he had to get out there and get ahead of this. He had to cauterise the damage \u2026 because of what Mrs Deeming had done,\u201d Collins said, before he listed previous Liberal scandals, including an infamous dinner between the former Victorian Liberal leader Matthew Guy and an alleged mafia boss. \u201cMr Guy went to a dinner with Mr Madafferi \u2013 the lobster with a mobster \u2013 that did political damage. [Bernie] Finn, Mrs Deeming\u2019s predecessor [as Liberal MP for the Western Metropolitan Region], shared a [doctored image] of the then premier [Daniel Andrews] wearing a Nazi uniform, that did real damage. \u201cMrs Deeming\u2019s conduct on the 18th and 19th [of March] and her inaction thereafter caused serious political problems. That might be unfair and I might wish for a world in which debate is more nuanced, but that\u2019s not the world we live in.\u201d Deeming alleges that Pesutto defamed her in four publications after the rally: a media release, interviews on ABC News Breakfast and 3AW Radio, a press conference and a dossier justifying her expulsion. Pesutto\u2019s legal team have relied on the legal defences of claims of honest opinion, contextual truth, public interest and qualified privilege. Collins said that as opposition leader Pesutto was \u201cuniquely placed to judge the politics of the matter\u201d and felt it was \u201cnecessary to explain\u201d to the public why he was moving to expel Deeming. \u201c[He is in the] position of the alternative premier of the state, not the position of a judge or barrister. Could a person in his position reasonably believe that these publications were in the public interest? That\u2019s the essence of the defence,\u201d he said. But Chrysanthou argued Pesutto characterised his opinion as \u201cfact\u201d and did not take reasonable care before publishing, meaning he was not protected from the defences. On Tuesday, Chrysanthou went through the two media interviews in forensic detail, arguing it was clear through Pesutto\u2019s \u201ctone\u201d, \u201cdemeanour\u201d and \u201cwords\u201d that he was \u201cgoing into bat\u201d for himself against Deeming. Referring to the media release, she said Pesutto made a \u201cdeliberate decision\u201d to exclude from a sentence from the draft, which referred to Nazi\u2019s \u201cgatecrashing\u201d Deeming\u2019s event. She argued that the release, sent to about 750 journalists, could lead an ordinary reader to think Deeming \u201corganised, attended and spoke at a Nazi rally\u201d. Chrysanthou also accused Pesutto of providing \u201cdishonest evidence\u201d about releasing the dossier, which he told the court he did because he believed the Age had already obtained a copy, and it was in the public interest. \u201cHe truly believed that it was a matter of political expediency \u2013 his own political expediency \u2013 to publish this material,\u201d she said. \u201cHis credibility as a politician, his personal interests as a politician are not in the public interest.\u201d She claimed he did not disclose that a meeting was secretly recorded by the deputy Liberal leader, David Southwick, due to a \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d. Beginning his closing arguments on Wednesday afternoon, Collins told the court there should no dispute that the neo-Nazis were there to \u201csupport\u201d the headline speaker of the rally, the UK gender critical activist Kellie-Jay Keen. He said the rally was \u201canti-trans\u201d, given Keen began by \u201cprovoking\u201d the counter-protest. \u201cThe rally was an anti-trans rally, all of the media reported it that way and they were right,\u201d Collins said. His closing arguments are expected to conclude on Thursday, with justice David O\u2019Callaghan likely to deliver his findings in December.",

Even liqueurs and soft drinks are house-made. Importantly, the food is also amazing. Pre-starters of Ukrainian borscht with crispy buckwheat, mushroom jelly with shaved red cabbage, and fresh peas and beans in barbecue sauce leave our bouches very amused.

Every Den Haager has caught a tyre in one at some stage. The 13th-century Binnenhof, site of parliament and the prime minister\u2019s office, is closed for renovation until 2028, but citizens are not being kept at arm\u2019s length. Platforms in the lake outside are being used for temporary exhibitions, and from a free-to-climb viewing tower at its western end, people can peer over the palace walls at the work in progress and enjoy a 360-degree view of the city. Anyone who missed last year\u2019s blockbuster Vermeer exhibition in Amsterdam can make up for it at the Mauritshuis gallery. Girl With A Pearl Earring is luminous in the \u201cflesh\u201d, but a bigger surprise is the painter\u2019s View of Delft, with foreground waterside houses in shadow, but sunshine highlighting roofs and towers in the streets behind. I also enjoy a couple of Rembrandts and Fabritius\u2019s storied Goldfinch. The Hague has canals \u2013 Hooigracht and Nieuwe Uitleg are pretty \u2013 but a short hop away by train (15 minutes) or characterful tram (30 minutes), Delft, Vermeer\u2019s home, is surrounded by picturesque canals lined with period houses. In this small city almost dwarfed by the huge Delft University of Technology campus to its south (famous alumnus: one MC Escher \u2013 see below), there are trips to the factory where the eponymous blue and white porcelain is made, but we prefer wandering little lanes linked by cute bridges, and the main Markt square, with its 400-year-old town hall. Vermeer is buried in the Oude Kerk (\u201cold church\u201d, with leaning tower), while the tower of the Nieuwe Kerk, resting place of Dutch royals, can be climbed for far-reaching views. Back in The Hague, there are more galleries to visit. Escher in the Palace has hundreds of the artist\u2019s impossible staircases and other optical illusion prints, and the Kunstmuseum is home to masterpieces by Mondrian, Schiele, Kandinsky and Bridget Riley. Our evenings are spent dining sustainably. The Hague caters well for vegetarians and vegans, be they pizzerias, burger joints or Indonesian specialists. Our best meal is at Ethica, named after the philosophical treatise by Baruch Spinoza, who spent the latter part of his life in The Hague. Self-taught chef Robin Collard takes green cuisine to another level. The menu is mainly vegetarian, made with produce from his organic garden or sourced locally, but he also serves meat from wild animals that are in surplus in the Netherlands, such as hares and birds that have to be shot for aircraft safety at Schiphol. Even liqueurs and soft drinks are house-made. Importantly, the food is also amazing. Pre-starters of Ukrainian borscht with crispy buckwheat, mushroom jelly with shaved red cabbage, and fresh peas and beans in barbecue sauce leave our bouches very amused. The wild garlic tuile Robin served atop a duck breast starter was pungent, crisp, and unlike anything I\u2019d ever eaten. For later, there are cosy \u201cbrown cafes\u201d to drink in, and any number of live music bars, from the Paardcafe for up and coming talent, to Podium aan Zee by the beach, and rock music stalwart De Zwarte Ruiter. We don\u2019t see a red light district and aren\u2019t offered any drugs \u2013 yet another reason to come here rather than Amsterdam. \u2022 Accommodation was provided by Airbnb. Train travel from London to Rotterdam was provided Eurostar",

But while it may be small in stature, the new iPad mini remains pricey, costing from \u00a3499 (\u20ac599/$499/A$799), placing it in between the \u00a3329 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/26/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen\">base-model iPad</a> and the \u00a3599 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/20/ipad-air-m2-review-cheaper-apple-ipad-pro-for-rest-of-us-gets-bigger\">11in iPad Air</a>.</p> <p>The new tablet looks like a smaller version of the iPad Air, keeping the same 8.3in LCD display as its predecessor, which is crisp, bright and with a low-glare coating to make it easier to use outdoors. The so-called \u201cjelly scroll\u201d screen effect seen when scrolling on its predecessor is improved but you can still see it if you look hard enough.</p> <p>The tablet\u2019s great stereo speakers make the most of any videos or games. Its super thin body, sub-300g weight and width that is about the same as an A5 paper pad make the iPad mini really easy to grip, use and fit in bags.</p>    <p>The almost pocketable size makes it an excellent companion at school or on the commute, ready to take notes, play videos or for reading books like a Kindle. Its predecessor found niches with various professions, including hospitality and healthcare, with pilots being particular fans who will no doubt love this one.</p> <p>The one thing that hasn\u2019t changed that should have is the position of the centre stage video call camera, which is still on the lefthand side when held in landscape, rather than the top edge to match the rest of Apple\u2019s iPad lineup. It still works fine, but gives you a lower angle for video calls, which isn\u2019t ideal.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 8.3in 2266x1488 LCD display (326ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple A17 Pro</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 128, 256 or 512GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> iPadOS 18</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> 12MP rear and selfie cameras</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> wifi 6E (5G optional eSim-only), Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Touch ID</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 195.4 x 134.8 x 6.3mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 293g (4G version: 297g)</p></li> </ul> <h2>New A17 Pro chip and iPadOS 18</h2>    <p>The biggest change for the new iPad mini is the upgrade to the A17 Pro chip that was first used in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/11/iphone-15-pro-review-best-smaller-phone-usbc-apple\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. It provides a 30% speed increase over the outgoing model, as well as an AI processor that is twice as fast.</p> <p>It is in a class of its own compared with similarly sized tablets from rivals, but it isn\u2019t quite as powerful as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/20/ipad-air-m2-review-cheaper-apple-ipad-pro-for-rest-of-us-gets-bigger\">Apple\u2019s M2</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/15/ipad-pro-m4-review-ludicrously-good-hardware-thats-total-overkill-for-most\">M4 chips</a> used in its larger Air and Pro iPad models and doesn\u2019t support some of the more computer-like features.

Playing games or other more intensive usage shaves a couple of hours off the total, but it is still thoroughly impressive for a tablet of this size.</p> <p>The iPad mini runs the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/16/ios-18-release-apple-updates-ipados-18-macos-sequoia\">latest iPadOS 18</a> with its various new customisation options and brilliant new maths notes feature when used with a stylus.

      "bodyText": "Apple\u2019s premium tiny tablet gets a speed boost for 2024 with support for new accessories and imminent AI features, while providing the full modern iPad experience in a compact package. The revamped design of the iPad mini in 2021 was excellent so it is no surprise that Apple has kept it mostly the same with internal changes and a tweak to the side to support new accessories. But while it may be small in stature, the new iPad mini remains pricey, costing from \u00a3499 (\u20ac599/$499/A$799), placing it in between the \u00a3329 base-model iPad and the \u00a3599 11in iPad Air. The new tablet looks like a smaller version of the iPad Air, keeping the same 8.3in LCD display as its predecessor, which is crisp, bright and with a low-glare coating to make it easier to use outdoors. The so-called \u201cjelly scroll\u201d screen effect seen when scrolling on its predecessor is improved but you can still see it if you look hard enough. The tablet\u2019s great stereo speakers make the most of any videos or games. Its super thin body, sub-300g weight and width that is about the same as an A5 paper pad make the iPad mini really easy to grip, use and fit in bags. The almost pocketable size makes it an excellent companion at school or on the commute, ready to take notes, play videos or for reading books like a Kindle. Its predecessor found niches with various professions, including hospitality and healthcare, with pilots being particular fans who will no doubt love this one. The one thing that hasn\u2019t changed that should have is the position of the centre stage video call camera, which is still on the lefthand side when held in landscape, rather than the top edge to match the rest of Apple\u2019s iPad lineup. It still works fine, but gives you a lower angle for video calls, which isn\u2019t ideal. Specifications Screen: 8.3in 2266x1488 LCD display (326ppi) Processor: Apple A17 Pro RAM: 8GB Storage: 128, 256 or 512GB Operating system: iPadOS 18 Camera: 12MP rear and selfie cameras Connectivity: wifi 6E (5G optional eSim-only), Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Touch ID Dimensions: 195.4 x 134.8 x 6.3mm Weight: 293g (4G version: 297g) New A17 Pro chip and iPadOS 18 The biggest change for the new iPad mini is the upgrade to the A17 Pro chip that was first used in the iPhone 15 Pro. It provides a 30% speed increase over the outgoing model, as well as an AI processor that is twice as fast. It is in a class of its own compared with similarly sized tablets from rivals, but it isn\u2019t quite as powerful as Apple\u2019s M2 or M4 chips used in its larger Air and Pro iPad models and doesn\u2019t support some of the more computer-like features. You can plug a monitor into the tablet via USB-C but only for mirroring the screen or video output, not for use as an external display with the Stage Manager multitasking system. The battery lasts slightly longer than its predecessor at about 12 hours for streaming video over wifi or a solid 10 hours of general app usage for browsing, note taking and emailing. Playing games or other more intensive usage shaves a couple of hours off the total, but it is still thoroughly impressive for a tablet of this size. The iPad mini runs the latest iPadOS 18 with its various new customisation options and brilliant new maths notes feature when used with a stylus. But like the recently released iPhones, it lacks Apple\u2019s much-advertised Intelligence features, such as a smarter Siri, notification summaries, various AI writing tools, emoji and image generators. They will start rolling out in beta with the iPadOS 18.1 update at the end of October in the US and December for the UK, Australia and other non-US English countries. None of the features will work in the EU. Sustainability The battery should last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity, and can be replaced from \u00a3115.

Apple breaks down the tablet\u2019s environmental impact in its report and offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The iPad mini A17 Pro starts at \u00a3499 (\u20ac599/$499/A$799) or \u00a3649 (\u20ac769/$649/A$1,049) with 5G. For comparison, the 10th-gen iPad costs from \u00a3329, M2 iPad Air costs from \u00a3599, the iPad Pro M4 costs from \u00a3999, the Amazon Fire HD 8 costs \u00a399.99, Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 costs \u00a3169, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs \u00a31,799 and the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold costs \u00a31,749. Verdict Important chip and capability updates have kept the iPad mini the best small tablet available by no small margin. It is unrivalled with its nearest competitors being a handful of cheap Android tablets or the new breed of super expensive folding phones. Its practically-pocketable size makes it easy to hold and fit in bags, while iPadOS provides plenty of apps for a wide range of uses, not just entertainment. Equipped with a \u00a3129 Apple Pencil Pro it is a particularly good, if expensive, paper notebook replacement. Not having the M-series chips used in the iPad Air and Pro models limits its multitasking capabilities while the bigger screen of the cheaper 10th-gen iPad makes it a better buy for most people just wanting an Apple entertainment device. It is not a dramatic upgrade over the 2021 model either. With phones getting bigger and bigger, the iPad mini may seem redundant, but it is a particular favourite of journalists, pilots and those who need a highly capable, compact tablet that lasts a long time between charges. For all those people, the new A17 Pro iPad mini is almost perfect. Pros: compact design, great performance, 10-hour battery life, great screen, USB-C, iPadOS, large range of apps, great speakers, great mics, long software support, recycled aluminium, Apple Pencil Pro support. Cons: expensive, small size is cramped for some applications, video call camera on the side in landscape, no M-series chip for advanced multitasking or computer use, not a big upgrade.",

As an EU national in the UK, I was not able to cast my ballot in 2016. I remember the expectation most people had that Brexit would not win. I received the news while travelling in Spain and staying with a British national settled there, who could not vote in the referendum either. Some London-born friends told me they felt as though they could no longer recognise their country, which had been split in two. With that British experience on my mind, I had a sense of deja vu as I watched the results unfold in my native Moldova on Sunday night.</p> <p>As opinion <a href=\"https://watchdog.md/en/sondaje/\">polls</a> before the vote, which excluded Moldova\u2019s large, pro-European diaspora, suggested, there was between <a href=\"https://ipp.md/2024-10/barometrul-opiniei-publice-2024/\">54%</a> and <a href=\"https://watchdog.md/en/sondaje/\">65%</a> support for the EU.

I was in an echo-chamber.</p> <p>When the first results started to come in that night, the anti-EU vote seemed to dominate. It did so for hours. Following the count at a birthday party, my friends and I watched our phone screens in disbelief. One of them kept repeating: the first results come from smaller villages \u2013 it will get better as the votes from the capital city, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, and the diaspora get counted. I recalled the difference between London and other parts of the UK.

Consider cutbacks</strong></h2> <p>Raising a child from birth to the age of 18 costs, on average, \u00a3166,000 for a couple, and \u00a3220,000 for a lone parent in 2023, according to Child Poverty Action Group\u2019s annual cost of a child report. <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/2024/apr/02/the-britons-who-want-children-but-feel-they-cant\">Affordability is regularly cited by people</a> who would like to have children as a key reason for holding off doing so.</p> <p>Whether you\u2019re expecting a baby or you\u2019re hoping to start a family soon, the first place to begin sorting out your finances is by seeing if you can cut back on what you owe and spend, says Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at the advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> <p>\u201cDo this as early as possible, starting with the easy things \u2013 like not overpaying for insurance and TV, and switching any short-term debts to the lowest possible interest rate,\u201d she says.</p> <h2><strong>2. Review any mortgage</strong></h2> <p>\u201cA mortgage is probably your biggest outgoing, so keep this under close review to make sure you\u2019re getting the best rate, and keeping payments down,\u201d says David Hollingworth of London &amp; Country mortgage brokers.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are remortgaging or buying a new family-size home,\u201d Hollingworth adds, \u201cthink about the stability you need and consider a fixed rate.\u201d A longer-term fix gives the certainty of knowing what your monthly repayments will be for the coming few years, perhaps until your baby starts primary school.

Remember child benefit</strong></h2> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get child benefit automatically: you need to apply,\u201d says Coles. You can only do this once your child has been born and the birth is registered. Eligible parents can receive \u00a325.60 a week for their first child; \u00a316.95 for subsequent children.</p> <p>If either you, or your partner, earn \u00a360,000 or more, you will have to pay at least some of this back through the high income child benefit charge. If you earn \u00a380,000 or more, you must repay it all. \u201cIt\u2019s still worth registering for the benefit, even if you opt out of payments. This means that if one of the parents doesn\u2019t work while the child is under the age of 12, they\u2019ll get national insurance credits that will count towards their state pension,\u201d Coles says.</p> <p>Class 3 NI credits are given automatically to the parent who registers \u2013 you can transfer them between parents and guardians, but you\u2019ll need to apply.</p> <h2><strong>6.

Consider cutbacks Raising a child from birth to the age of 18 costs, on average, \u00a3166,000 for a couple, and \u00a3220,000 for a lone parent in 2023, according to Child Poverty Action Group\u2019s annual cost of a child report. Affordability is regularly cited by people who would like to have children as a key reason for holding off doing so. Whether you\u2019re expecting a baby or you\u2019re hoping to start a family soon, the first place to begin sorting out your finances is by seeing if you can cut back on what you owe and spend, says Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at the advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cDo this as early as possible, starting with the easy things \u2013 like not overpaying for insurance and TV, and switching any short-term debts to the lowest possible interest rate,\u201d she says. 2. Review any mortgage \u201cA mortgage is probably your biggest outgoing, so keep this under close review to make sure you\u2019re getting the best rate, and keeping payments down,\u201d says David Hollingworth of London &amp; Country mortgage brokers. \u201cIf you are remortgaging or buying a new family-size home,\u201d Hollingworth adds, \u201cthink about the stability you need and consider a fixed rate.\u201d A longer-term fix gives the certainty of knowing what your monthly repayments will be for the coming few years, perhaps until your baby starts primary school. This will allow you to plan your other finances around your biggest cost. Switching to a cheaper deal, if you can, when you reach the end of your current fixed-rate period, will reduce monthly repayments, and extending your mortgage term will push them down further. \u201cIf you have a remortgage looming, you might want to consider a longer term deal to reduce monthly costs,\u201d Coles says. However, she adds: \u201cThis will mean paying the mortgage later in life \u2013 which could derail your retirement plans \u2013 so don\u2019t rush into anything without thinking through all the implications.\u201d It will also mean higher overall interest costs unless you reduce the term again later. 3.

      "body": "<p>Good morning. If the answer is \u201cprison works\u201d, it now seems that the most likely question is: what is a good example of a demonstrable policy failure where successive governments have nonetheless decided to stick with the status quo?</p> <p>England and Wales lock up more people than any other country in western Europe, with Scotland close behind; thanks largely to longer sentences, the prison population has doubled since 1993. But while crime has dropped considerably over that period, the same effect has been seen in countries that don\u2019t lock up nearly so many people \u2013 and about 44% of freed prisoners are convicted again within a year.</p> <p>If stopping crime is the definition of \u201cworking\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/html-publication/item/reconceptualising-the-effectiveness-of-sentencing-four-perspectives/#8.%20Conclusions\">research by the Sentencing Council</a> says there is no evidence that more people serving longer sentences has acted as a deterrent. Meanwhile, our prisons are facing a capacity crisis, and the government has resorted to freeing people early to reduce overcrowding, with another 1,100 being released yesterday.</p> <p>That is the context for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/20/fewer-women-may-go-to-jail-in-england-and-wales-in-sentencing-review\">a sentencing review</a>, to be conducted by the former Conservative justice minister David Gauke, that has just been ordered by the government \u2013 and while it can\u2019t solve today\u2019s crisis, it may hold hope of staving off the next one. Since prison plainly doesn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d, today\u2019s newsletter runs you through some of the things that might fix it. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>UK news</strong></em> | Police chiefs have asked the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/22/police-chiefs-government-make-harder-prosecute-officers-after-chris-kaba-shooting\">to make it harder to prosecute officers</a> after a sergeant was acquitted of the murder of Chris Kaba, in a move that drew immediate criticism from campaigners as a grant of \u201ceffective immunity\u201d. It meanwhile emerged that Kaba had shot a man a few days before he was killed and was allegedly a core member of a south London gang. </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Middle East</strong></em> | Israel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/22/israel-confirms-killing-of-presumed-next-leader-of-hezbollah\">has confirmed the killing</a> of the presumed next leader of Hezbollah in an airstrike on southern Beirut earlier in October. In a statement on Tuesday evening, the Israeli military said strikes in the suburb of Dahiyeh had killed Hashem Safieddine three weeks ago. Hezbollah has not yet commented.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Water</strong></em> | Water companies in England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/22/new-commission-may-ban-england-water-companies-from-making-a-profit\">could be banned from making a profit</a> under plans for a complete overhaul of the system. The idea is one of several under consideration by a new commission amid public fury over sewage in rivers and mismanagement. </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>US elections</strong></em> | Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/23/keir-starmer-donald-trump-labour-election-interference-claim\">has filed an extraordinary complaint against the UK\u2019s Labour party</a>, claiming that volunteers joining the Kamala Harris campaign are guilty of \u201cblatant foreign interference\u201d. Keir Starmer insisted he could maintain a good relationship with Trump despite the claim.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Culture</strong></em> | Abba\u2019s Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, actor Julianne Moore and Radiohead singer Thom Yorke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/22/thom-yorke-and-julianne-moore-join-thousands-of-creatives-in-ai-warning\">are among 10,500 signatories</a> of a statement from the creative industries warning artificial intelligence companies that unlicensed use of their work is a \u201cmajor, unjust threat\u201d to artists\u2019 livelihoods.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: From sobriety tags and \u2018nudge\u2019 watches to a queuing system and house arrest</h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2024/10/how-to-fix-the-prisons-crisis\">In a New Statesman article</a> published on Monday, David Gauke was clear that he favoured a fundamental rethink of sentencing policy. \u201cFor the last 30 years, there has been a sentencing bidding war between the political parties seeking to compete to be seen as the toughest on crime,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have no choice but to pause the increase in the prison population.\u201d</p> <p>To grapple with some of the options that might be under consideration, you first have to know that the measures that might address the immediate capacity emergency \u2013 like releasing prisoners early and delaying court hearings \u2013 are distinct from those that could be part of sustainable reforms in the long term. The government is already using the first set of measures; it has asked Gauke to look at the second category.</p> <p>Another issue is the availability of prison places \u2013 but even if Labour succeeds in its promise to create 14,000 additional places in six new prisons at a cost of \u00a34bn, they will still be 8,000 places short by 2028, <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publication/crisis-prisons#:~:text=Most%20effective%20options%201%20Lower%20the%20point%20of,up%20to%20three%20years%20to%20be%20suspended%20\">the Institute for Government estimates</a>. So even if you think more prisons are a brilliant idea in their own right \u2013 see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/21/friday-briefing-prisons-are-literally-falling-apart-and-theres-no-plan-to-save-them\">this First Edition</a> with former chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick for some of the reasons they might not be \u2013 they are not a complete solution to the problem.</p> <p>None of the below measures will solve the crisis on their own, either \u2013 and they will often increase pressure elsewhere. But in some combination, they may represent the best chance of fixing the system for the long term. </p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Reduce the use of short prison sentences</strong></p> <p>When he was justice secretary, Gauke argued for a reduction in the use of short sentences. And he is not the only observer to conclude that short prison sentences for minor offences are ineffective. About two-thirds of people sentenced to less than six months in jail go on to reoffend; people who aren\u2019t sent to prison are much less likely to do the same.</p> <p>In 2021, John Bache, former chair of the Magistrates\u2019 Association, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/05/short-jail-terms-fail-to-prevent-reoffending-says-former-england-and-wales-magistrate\">told Haroon Siddique</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t see that short prison sentences actually achieve a great deal. The bulk of these people, who commit multiple crimes, they\u2019ve got an underlying problem, which is mental health or alcohol or drugs or a combination of any two or three of those.\u201d The solution, he said, was to address those underlying problems.</p> <p>The Howard League, a charity that advocates for prison reform, argues that the government should introduce a presumption against the use of short sentences, but that courts should retain the discretion to impose one if there is a specific reason to do so. With about half of all people sent to prison on sentences of less than six months, that would have a significant effect on overall numbers.</p> <p>Another step would be to abolish recall for breaching parole conditions for sentences of less than 12 months, which are often shorter than two weeks, and for administrative breaches. </p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Introduce a \u2018</strong><strong>queuing</strong><strong> system\u2019 or house arrest</strong></p> <p>Prisoners are often released from custody early and given an electronic tag to ensure they keep to a 7pm-7am curfew. In <a href=\"https://justice.org.uk/ease-prison-crisis-with-norwegian-style-queueing-system-finds-justice-report/#:~:text=It%20also%20advocates%20for%20the,improvements%20to%20the%20complaints%20system.\">a report for the law reform charity Justice</a> earlier this year, Hardwick argued that some convicted criminals should be tagged before being imprisoned, with the time in the \u201cqueue\u201d deducted from their overall sentences.</p> <p>That could reduce pressure on prison numbers. The same approach is taken in Norway, where reoffending rates have dropped from 70% to 20% since the 1990s. While it might be unpalatable to some, it is likely to be preferable to the current approach of simply delaying sentencing on an ad-hoc basis.</p> <p>The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/oct/21/england-and-wales-sentencing-overhaul-could-bring-in-home-detention\">said yesterday</a> that judges could also be given the power to sentence people to house arrest. That would be a similar approach, but with no custodial element \u2013 and would be another way to reduce short prison sentences overall.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Prioritise remand hearings</strong></p> <p>Partly because of the pandemic, the number of people on remand \u2013 that is, waiting for trial and not yet convicted \u2013 has risen 84% since 2019, the Institute for Government says; they now account for almost 20% of the total prison population, or 17,000 \u2013 a record high. Many defendants now spend more than six months on remand waiting for a trial \u2013 but 30% of that number do not get an immediate custodial sentence. Those on remand have the highest suicide rates among all prisoners.</p> <p>In 2022, more than half of those who had been held on remand for more than six months were facing trial for alleged non-violent offences.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. If the answer is \u201cprison works\u201d, it now seems that the most likely question is: what is a good example of a demonstrable policy failure where successive governments have nonetheless decided to stick with the status quo? England and Wales lock up more people than any other country in western Europe, with Scotland close behind; thanks largely to longer sentences, the prison population has doubled since 1993. But while crime has dropped considerably over that period, the same effect has been seen in countries that don\u2019t lock up nearly so many people \u2013 and about 44% of freed prisoners are convicted again within a year. If stopping crime is the definition of \u201cworking\u201d, research by the Sentencing Council says there is no evidence that more people serving longer sentences has acted as a deterrent. Meanwhile, our prisons are facing a capacity crisis, and the government has resorted to freeing people early to reduce overcrowding, with another 1,100 being released yesterday. That is the context for a sentencing review, to be conducted by the former Conservative justice minister David Gauke, that has just been ordered by the government \u2013 and while it can\u2019t solve today\u2019s crisis, it may hold hope of staving off the next one. Since prison plainly doesn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d, today\u2019s newsletter runs you through some of the things that might fix it. Here are the headlines. Five big stories UK news | Police chiefs have asked the government to make it harder to prosecute officers after a sergeant was acquitted of the murder of Chris Kaba, in a move that drew immediate criticism from campaigners as a grant of \u201ceffective immunity\u201d. It meanwhile emerged that Kaba had shot a man a few days before he was killed and was allegedly a core member of a south London gang. Middle East | Israel has confirmed the killing of the presumed next leader of Hezbollah in an airstrike on southern Beirut earlier in October. In a statement on Tuesday evening, the Israeli military said strikes in the suburb of Dahiyeh had killed Hashem Safieddine three weeks ago. Hezbollah has not yet commented. Water | Water companies in England could be banned from making a profit under plans for a complete overhaul of the system. The idea is one of several under consideration by a new commission amid public fury over sewage in rivers and mismanagement. US elections | Donald Trump has filed an extraordinary complaint against the UK\u2019s Labour party, claiming that volunteers joining the Kamala Harris campaign are guilty of \u201cblatant foreign interference\u201d. Keir Starmer insisted he could maintain a good relationship with Trump despite the claim. Culture | Abba\u2019s Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, actor Julianne Moore and Radiohead singer Thom Yorke are among 10,500 signatories of a statement from the creative industries warning artificial intelligence companies that unlicensed use of their work is a \u201cmajor, unjust threat\u201d to artists\u2019 livelihoods. In depth: From sobriety tags and \u2018nudge\u2019 watches to a queuing system and house arrest In a New Statesman article published on Monday, David Gauke was clear that he favoured a fundamental rethink of sentencing policy. \u201cFor the last 30 years, there has been a sentencing bidding war between the political parties seeking to compete to be seen as the toughest on crime,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have no choice but to pause the increase in the prison population.\u201d To grapple with some of the options that might be under consideration, you first have to know that the measures that might address the immediate capacity emergency \u2013 like releasing prisoners early and delaying court hearings \u2013 are distinct from those that could be part of sustainable reforms in the long term. The government is already using the first set of measures; it has asked Gauke to look at the second category. Another issue is the availability of prison places \u2013 but even if Labour succeeds in its promise to create 14,000 additional places in six new prisons at a cost of \u00a34bn, they will still be 8,000 places short by 2028, the Institute for Government estimates. So even if you think more prisons are a brilliant idea in their own right \u2013 see this First Edition with former chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick for some of the reasons they might not be \u2013 they are not a complete solution to the problem. None of the below measures will solve the crisis on their own, either \u2013 and they will often increase pressure elsewhere. But in some combination, they may represent the best chance of fixing the system for the long term. *** Reduce the use of short prison sentences When he was justice secretary, Gauke argued for a reduction in the use of short sentences. And he is not the only observer to conclude that short prison sentences for minor offences are ineffective. About two-thirds of people sentenced to less than six months in jail go on to reoffend; people who aren\u2019t sent to prison are much less likely to do the same. In 2021, John Bache, former chair of the Magistrates\u2019 Association, told Haroon Siddique: \u201cI don\u2019t see that short prison sentences actually achieve a great deal. The bulk of these people, who commit multiple crimes, they\u2019ve got an underlying problem, which is mental health or alcohol or drugs or a combination of any two or three of those.\u201d The solution, he said, was to address those underlying problems. The Howard League, a charity that advocates for prison reform, argues that the government should introduce a presumption against the use of short sentences, but that courts should retain the discretion to impose one if there is a specific reason to do so. With about half of all people sent to prison on sentences of less than six months, that would have a significant effect on overall numbers. Another step would be to abolish recall for breaching parole conditions for sentences of less than 12 months, which are often shorter than two weeks, and for administrative breaches. *** Introduce a \u2018queuing system\u2019 or house arrest Prisoners are often released from custody early and given an electronic tag to ensure they keep to a 7pm-7am curfew. In a report for the law reform charity Justice earlier this year, Hardwick argued that some convicted criminals should be tagged before being imprisoned, with the time in the \u201cqueue\u201d deducted from their overall sentences. That could reduce pressure on prison numbers. The same approach is taken in Norway, where reoffending rates have dropped from 70% to 20% since the 1990s. While it might be unpalatable to some, it is likely to be preferable to the current approach of simply delaying sentencing on an ad-hoc basis. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said yesterday that judges could also be given the power to sentence people to house arrest. That would be a similar approach, but with no custodial element \u2013 and would be another way to reduce short prison sentences overall. *** Prioritise remand hearings Partly because of the pandemic, the number of people on remand \u2013 that is, waiting for trial and not yet convicted \u2013 has risen 84% since 2019, the Institute for Government says; they now account for almost 20% of the total prison population, or 17,000 \u2013 a record high. Many defendants now spend more than six months on remand waiting for a trial \u2013 but 30% of that number do not get an immediate custodial sentence. Those on remand have the highest suicide rates among all prisoners. In 2022, more than half of those who had been held on remand for more than six months were facing trial for alleged non-violent offences. If those cases were brought to court more rapidly, the pressure on prison places would decrease. But that would require more investment in the courts, or further delays to other cases. *** Put more resources into probation These changes would increase demands on the probation service \u2013 which the chief inspector of probation in England and Wales has already said are unsustainable. He argued in July that even short-term measures to reduce overcrowding ought to mean that those sentenced for minor offences such as shoplifting should no longer be supervised. A report by Channel 4 last month revealed that the probation service has consistently been working at 120% capacity since January 2023, figures which the probation officers\u2019 union said were likely an underestimate. A recruitment programme is underway to recruit 1,000 new trainees, and pay rises have also been brought forward. But officials have also been looking at ways technology could fill the gap. Options include expanding the use of smart watch-style devices that send messages to offenders reminding them of appointments and restrictions, and \u201csobriety tags\u201d that monitor alcohol consumption. *** End \u2018sentence inflation\u2019 and create incentives for good behaviour In the end, changes to short sentences and remand will only go so far: the main driver of the increase in prison numbers has been the imposition of longer sentences. About 57% of prisoners on determinate sentences were serving four years or more in March this year, with another 15% of the total prison population serving indeterminate sentences. Most of these people are in prison for serious crimes: more than half have been convicted of violent or sexual offences. But one sign of Gauke\u2019s view is his praise for an approach in Texas, where the prison population has been reduced by rewarding prisoners who complete rehabilitation programmes and show evidence of changed behaviour. At the same time, crime rates have fallen. Gauke could advocate for a similar approach. Others have called for more fundamental changes to sentencing guidelines and an attempt to escape the long-term trend of repeating \u201csentence inflation\u201d. Other options include reducing the use of long custodial sentences for women, who are typically low risk, and a presumption that prisoners should be moved to another secure location once they reach a certain age. There is no doubt that some of these options will be very politically difficult. But there is little reason to think that the status quo \u2013 huge numbers of people locked up at great expense and in grim conditions, often going on to reoffend anyway \u2013 does not come with risks of its own.

Woolworths and Coles have blamed suppliers and a \u201csudden outbreak of high inflation\u201d for price spikes, as they appeared in the federal court for the first time since the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission launched legal action against the supermarket giants. It is alleged the companies misled customers with \u201cillusory\u201d discounts on hundreds of common products. Shortly before the court appearance, the ACCC lodged fresh legal documents showing more than 250 items, from marinades to instant noodles, on which the regulator alleges supermarkets briefly increased prices before subsequently reducing them slightly and advertising them as discounts. Cameron Moore SC, representing Woolworths, labelled the ACCC\u2019s case \u201cmisconceived\u201d, with lawyers for both companies arguing the fluctuations were due to requests by suppliers for price increases in response to rising inflation and costs. Sarida McLeod, representing the regulator, responded that \u201cthe conduct is still misleading\u201d.

      "body": "<p>I was visiting my brother at RAF Chivenor in 1994, where he was based as an armourer. My parents and I had driven from Glasgow for the weekend so they could go for dinner with him and his new girlfriend. I didn\u2019t want to go. Fortunately, my brother knew that and suggested I stay in his room and ransack his music collection.<strong> </strong>\u201cHere, listen to that one first,\u201d he said, handing me a CD. The now unmistakable opening chords of Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Star started. The filthy guitar riff announced the arrival of Oasis in my life, when I was 14.</p> <p>When I got back home, I rushed out to buy my own copy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/26/oasis-definitely-maybe-reviewed-1994\">Definitely Maybe</a>, the band\u2019s first album. My running trainers, jogging bottoms and Sweater Shop jumpers were replaced by Adidas Sambas, Adidas tracksuit tops and Fred Perry polo shirts. None of these were to be worn for sports. I wanted to emulate Liam and Noel Gallagher. I got a pair of Levi\u2019s 501s and a Parka to finish off the look. The clothes were fashion accessories to give me a swagger, an identity and the mardy teenager look. Thankfully, my nana would buy me this stuff from a second-hand clothes shop as my mum never understood the importance of labels \u2013 unless it was Clarks shoes for school. </p> <p>This was my uniform. This was my music. My parents had the Beatles and Rolling Stones. My older brother had the Specials and Smiths, and now I had Oasis and Blur. I was team Oasis. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t like Blur\u2019s music \u2013 I did. However, I didn\u2019t know people like Damon Albarn or Alex James. I knew guys like Liam and Noel: all attitude, swagger and strut. In the Glasgow vernacular we would call them \u201cgallus\u201d, a word to describe the trifecta of bold, daring and reckless.</p>    <p>I come from a working-class background and seeing celebrities who looked and behaved like people I knew made me feel there were no barriers for me. I was born in January 1980; it was a bleak period to grow up in the west of Scotland. The East End of Glasgow and the area around it was destroyed by the de-industrialisation imposed by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government.</p> <p>My father had to work away from home as an electrician, mainly in the south of England, as&nbsp;Scotland had no jobs. My brother&nbsp;joined the Royal Air Force \u2013 it was an opportunity not to serve his country but to run away from the desperate decline he saw in Scotland. I watched many of my friends\u2019 older siblings move from glue sniffing and giggles in a&nbsp;classroom to burning brown stuff&nbsp;on a teaspoon in the local woods. With no jobs available, they&nbsp;got lost in a sea of needles.</p> <p> I became obsessed with Oasis. I bought every CD single and album. I would bunk off school to queue for new releases and gig tickets at HMV. I even slept on the street overnight with my friends behind the music store to buy a \u00a322.50 ticket to see them at Loch Lomond. I was 16 and that concert ended up being one of the greatest weekends of my life.</p> <p>As Oasis led the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/26/dont-look-back-in-anger-daniel-rachel-review\">Cool Britannia</a> revolution, Tony Blair was leading his own political one. The 501s-wearing, Fender Stratocaster-playing New Labour leader promised change. He sold me a dream of hope and prosperity. I felt change in the air. My friends and I became politically engaged because Oasis told us to vote Labour in 1997. Tony promised that things would get better and Noel sang in Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger that we could start a revolution from our beds. And we did as first-time voters, not influenced by our parents but by our musical heroes. </p>    <p>Some Might Say things did get better for a while. The economy was on the up, Tony brought about the Good Friday agreement and for the first time in my life I could turn on the TV and not see violence on the streets in another part of the UK. As a lesbian, it was incredible to see LGBT equality on the agenda. The throwing out of section 28, which prohibited local authorities and schools from \u201cpromoting\u201d homosexuality was monumental.</p> <p>But it all came to an abrupt halt for me with the release of Be Here Now on 21 August 1997, an album that sounded like it had been recorded on cocaine with the hubris of Nero. Oasis took the disdain too far. Then, 10 days later, Princess Diana was killed in a car accident in Paris. Britain went into mourning. I felt it was all over: the hope, the change and the soundtrack disappeared.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if it was my own circumstances, the world changing in general, or a combination of both. I strutted out of my lesbian closet with the same swagger as Liam, only to be rejected by those who were supposed to love, support and nurture me. I was 17 years old; I felt alone, guilty and ashamed. I felt I had let my family down. I left home to live with my beloved nana. Suddenly, I was an adult, albeit a small adult, underage drinking in a gay bar trying to find a girl to kiss.</p> <p>Thirty years later, my wardrobe remains the same. The tracksuit top is a little tighter, the Fred Perry is up a size and Adidas Sambas are more expensive. My politics will forever be left of centre. I still love Liam and Noel, even if they don\u2019t love each other. Their music was the soundtrack to a pivotal point in my life. It was a time of political progress for the marginalised and a time of hope. Those two lads made me believe, as a working-class kid, that I belonged in this country.</p> <p><em>Susie McCabe\u2019s <a href=\"https://susiemccabe.com/\">standup tour </a>The&nbsp;Merchant Of</em> <em>Menace starts on 1&nbsp;November.</em></p>",

I wanted to emulate Liam and Noel Gallagher. I got a pair of Levi\u2019s 501s and a Parka to finish off the look. The clothes were fashion accessories to give me a swagger, an identity and the mardy teenager look. Thankfully, my nana would buy me this stuff from a second-hand clothes shop as my mum never understood the importance of labels \u2013 unless it was Clarks shoes for school. This was my uniform. This was my music. My parents had the Beatles and Rolling Stones. My older brother had the Specials and Smiths, and now I had Oasis and Blur. I was team Oasis. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t like Blur\u2019s music \u2013 I did. However, I didn\u2019t know people like Damon Albarn or Alex James. I knew guys like Liam and Noel: all attitude, swagger and strut. In the Glasgow vernacular we would call them \u201cgallus\u201d, a word to describe the trifecta of bold, daring and reckless. I come from a working-class background and seeing celebrities who looked and behaved like people I knew made me feel there were no barriers for me. I was born in January 1980; it was a bleak period to grow up in the west of Scotland. The East End of Glasgow and the area around it was destroyed by the de-industrialisation imposed by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government. My father had to work away from home as an electrician, mainly in the south of England, as Scotland had no jobs. My brother joined the Royal Air Force \u2013 it was an opportunity not to serve his country but to run away from the desperate decline he saw in Scotland. I watched many of my friends\u2019 older siblings move from glue sniffing and giggles in a classroom to burning brown stuff on a teaspoon in the local woods. With no jobs available, they got lost in a sea of needles. I became obsessed with Oasis. I bought every CD single and album. I would bunk off school to queue for new releases and gig tickets at HMV. I even slept on the street overnight with my friends behind the music store to buy a \u00a322.50 ticket to see them at Loch Lomond. I was 16 and that concert ended up being one of the greatest weekends of my life. As Oasis led the Cool Britannia revolution, Tony Blair was leading his own political one. The 501s-wearing, Fender Stratocaster-playing New Labour leader promised change. He sold me a dream of hope and prosperity. I felt change in the air. My friends and I became politically engaged because Oasis told us to vote Labour in 1997. Tony promised that things would get better and Noel sang in Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger that we could start a revolution from our beds. And we did as first-time voters, not influenced by our parents but by our musical heroes. Some Might Say things did get better for a while. The economy was on the up, Tony brought about the Good Friday agreement and for the first time in my life I could turn on the TV and not see violence on the streets in another part of the UK. As a lesbian, it was incredible to see LGBT equality on the agenda. The throwing out of section 28, which prohibited local authorities and schools from \u201cpromoting\u201d homosexuality was monumental. But it all came to an abrupt halt for me with the release of Be Here Now on 21 August 1997, an album that sounded like it had been recorded on cocaine with the hubris of Nero. Oasis took the disdain too far. Then, 10 days later, Princess Diana was killed in a car accident in Paris. Britain went into mourning. I felt it was all over: the hope, the change and the soundtrack disappeared. I don\u2019t know if it was my own circumstances, the world changing in general, or a combination of both. I strutted out of my lesbian closet with the same swagger as Liam, only to be rejected by those who were supposed to love, support and nurture me. I was 17 years old; I felt alone, guilty and ashamed. I felt I had let my family down. I left home to live with my beloved nana. Suddenly, I was an adult, albeit a small adult, underage drinking in a gay bar trying to find a girl to kiss. Thirty years later, my wardrobe remains the same. The tracksuit top is a little tighter, the Fred Perry is up a size and Adidas Sambas are more expensive. My politics will forever be left of centre. I still love Liam and Noel, even if they don\u2019t love each other. Their music was the soundtrack to a pivotal point in my life. It was a time of political progress for the marginalised and a time of hope. Those two lads made me believe, as a working-class kid, that I belonged in this country.

In a joint statement, the St Patrick\u2019s Student Association, ACU National Student Association, the Melbourne LGBTIQ+ Society and the ACU LGBTIQ+ Staff Ally Network said the ACU Senate\u2019s decision to afford De Bruyn a platform to voice his views on reproductive and LGBTIQ+ rights saw the ceremony become a \u201charmful space\u201d. \u201cDe Bruyn\u2019s views were on the public record prior to this ceremony and it could be anticipated that they would cause distress for students and staff,\u201d their statement read. \u201cWe are particularly concerned by reports from staff that ACU counselling staff were organised ahead of time to be available following the ceremony to support students and staff. \u201cWe therefore call on the ACU senate and executive to explain why de Bruyn was permitted to deliver an address that was expected to result in students and staff requiring support from counsellors.\u201d The NTEU\u2019s ACU branch condemned the awarding of an honorary doctorate to De Bruyn, labelling it a \u201cdisturbing trend\u201d 12 months after management instructed some staff to remove rainbow flags from the library. The issue was eventually reversed, with the vice-chancellor expressing \u201cregret\u201d for the hurt and distress it had caused. \u201c[De Bruyn\u2019s] speech attacking reproductive and LGBTIQ+ rights turned what should have been a celebration into a hurtful event for staff and students,\u201d the branch said. \u201cThis follows a disturbing trend after \u2026 staff being instructed by management to remove rainbow flags from their workplaces last year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After four weeks trapped inside a Sydney shopping centre, Mickey the cockatoo seemed relieved to get out. Ravi Wasan \u2013 the director of Feathered Friends sanctuary who successfully captured the bird in the Coles supermarket at Macarthur Square yesterday \u2013 says once Mickey was outside \u201che was so happy, he was squawking\u201d. The sulphur-crested cockatoo hadn\u2019t managed to leave by itself because it was likely scared, the shopping centre was large with high ceilings, and the exits were low and crowded with people, he says. So he brought along Old Lady Doris, another cockatoo, as reassurance for Mickey. That led to some \u201creally cute scenes where they were canoodling with each other\u201d, Wasan says. So what do you do if a bird like Mickey drops by and doesn\u2019t \u2013 or can\u2019t \u2013 leave? Why do birds fly inside? Food is a common factor that lures birds inside buildings, according to John Grant, a spokesperson for wildlife rescue organisation Wires. Pigeons and mynas \u201clove a food court, as we all know\u201d, he says. Native birds, such as butcherbirds and magpies, also notice when food is left near a doorway or window ledge \u2013 either deliberately, or as leftover pet food \u2013 and it often isn\u2019t long before the birds head inside to try their luck, he says. But offering them a bite is not recommended, Grant says. \u201cIt\u2019s our constant mantra: please don\u2019t feed wildlife and keep food away from them.\u201d What should I do if a bird flies inside? The first tip is age-old advice: stay calm. \u201cOnce they\u2019re in a house, if there\u2019s a dog or a pet or a child who wants to get close to it, then the bird will panic and start flying everywhere,\u201d Grant says. The ensuring chaos means birds can easily injure themselves \u2013 particularly if they fly into ceilings, fans or closed windows. It is best to move slowly and quietly, remove any food in the area and lock pets like dogs or cats in a room, Grant says. Then open all the windows and doors, and wait. \u201cGenerally, the bird will fly out of its own accord,\u201d he says. Failing that, people can call a local wildlife group \u2013 such as Wires or Wildlife Victoria \u2013 for advice or assistance. But what if I want to attract birds? Dr Holly Parsons, an urban bird expert and program manager at BirdLife Australia, says feeding birds for fun is a controversial and complex issue in Australia; an activity that millions of people enjoy that is not recommended by experts or authorities. \u201cLiving on brioche and water\u201d, like Mickey, isn\u2019t healthy. \u201cSomething like bread is actually really bad for birds, it doesn\u2019t have a lot of nutrition for them, it just takes up space,\u201d Parsons says. Minced meat, which many people fed to magpies and kookaburras, is also problematic. \u201cMince is just the muscle, which means it doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of vitamins and minerals from calcium and things that birds need,\u201d Parsons says. \u201cIt\u2019s also really sticky, so it can get stuck in beaks and breed bacteria, and there can be problems with beak snapping.\u201d She urges those who plan to feed birds to \u201cthink really carefully\u201d, be responsible and abide by any rules or signs in public places. Bird baths are a better option for attracting wildlife, provided the water is kept clean and there are rocks to help birds get out of deep water if they slip. Parsons says while there can be challenges sometimes from birds and people living together in urban environments, there are also \u201ca huge range of positives\u201d. \u201cThat connection to nature that we can get by being outside, by listening to birdsong, by being amongst nature,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we don\u2019t often realise in Australia just how lucky we are to have such a diverse range of birds that live where we live.\u201d",

Those are humiliating statistics for a party that wants to shrink the state. To anyone disinclined to examine the real causes, it proves how deeply Rishi Sunak\u2019s reign was contaminated with socialism.</p> <p>What actually happened was a pandemic on top of dismal productivity, compounded by years of underinvestment in public services and infrastructure. A pointless campaign to introduce friction at the border with Britain\u2019s largest trading partner didn\u2019t help.</p> <p>From the start, under David Cameron, the Conservatives were on an explicit mission to wean the public off debilitating reliance on the state. Measured on its own terms that was an exercise in sustained failure equivalent to 20th-century Marxist excursions in stubbornly dogmatic policymaking.</p> <p>Underfunding the public realm, hollowing out local authorities and withdrawing benefits saved money in the short term but quickly generated higher social costs \u2013 a poorer, more miserable and less healthy society. Cutting the supply of government did not reduce demand. Chancellors were compelled to raid contingency funds and throw cash at every passing problem, most commonly in the NHS. Cash was burned up in crisis management, not invested in long-term mitigation. Taxes crept up without any dividend in improving services. The worst of both worlds.</p> <p>The furore over early prisoner release is a parable of myopic austerity. It was easy to slash the justice department\u2019s budget because MPs and rightwing newspaper editors do not hanker for a well-resourced prison estate. But they do insist on ever-higher custodial sentences for villains. More incarceration in fewer jails means overcrowding, riots or early release.</p> <p>That much was understood by David Gauke who, as justice secretary in Theresa May\u2019s cabinet, tried to rationalise sentencing within available resources. He has now been recruited by Keir Starmer to lead a review in that area. It is a revealing hire. Gauke represents a strand of liberal centre-right conservatism that would be prominent in any plan to rehabilitate the party as a serious proposition for government. Instead, he is working for a Labour prime minister, while his former colleagues wade deeper into the murky waters where hostility to state intervention shades into conspiracy theories about criminal civil servants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/16/tory-party-criticisms-legal-professionals-timeline\">and an obstructive \u201cblob\u201d</a>.</p> <p>This is the line that will divide Labour from the Tories in next week\u2019s budget. No one expects a spectacular display of Treasury munificence. The chancellor will raise taxes, tweak fiscal rules to permit more borrowing and keep budgets tighter than her own side would like. On the right, Rachel Reeves will be denounced for reckless profligacy and on the left for cruel parsimony. She will be caricatured as Old Labour and Red Tory. She can\u2019t be both.</p> <p>There will be plenty to dispute about the pace of investment and the choice of priorities. (There always is.) Labour\u2019s options are limited by the pre-election strategy of shadowing Conservative spending plans and forswearing recourse to the Treasury\u2019s most powerful revenue-raising levers. Whether that was essential to secure victory is something for historians to debate without access to the counterfactual where Reeves and Starmer went to the polls promising tax hikes.</p> <p>What is beyond question \u2013 or should be \u2013 is that Labour\u2019s first budget in 15 years will represent a radical departure in the way Britain is governed. For the first time in so many years, serious government and a public sector deemed worthy of investment will be the whole point.</p> <p>The contrast will be even starker when the result of the Conservative leadership contest is declared the following week. Whether it is Jenrick or Badenoch, the Tories will have a leader whose guiding doctrine has been tested beyond destruction. Labour understands the role that public services play in the economic and social wellbeing of the nation; the Conservatives don\u2019t. Why is one of those parties in government and the other in opposition? It\u2019s not a trick question, even if the Tories refuse to see the obvious answer.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Cash was burned up in crisis management, not invested in long-term mitigation. Taxes crept up without any dividend in improving services. The worst of both worlds. The furore over early prisoner release is a parable of myopic austerity. It was easy to slash the justice department\u2019s budget because MPs and rightwing newspaper editors do not hanker for a well-resourced prison estate. But they do insist on ever-higher custodial sentences for villains. More incarceration in fewer jails means overcrowding, riots or early release. That much was understood by David Gauke who, as justice secretary in Theresa May\u2019s cabinet, tried to rationalise sentencing within available resources. He has now been recruited by Keir Starmer to lead a review in that area. It is a revealing hire. Gauke represents a strand of liberal centre-right conservatism that would be prominent in any plan to rehabilitate the party as a serious proposition for government. Instead, he is working for a Labour prime minister, while his former colleagues wade deeper into the murky waters where hostility to state intervention shades into conspiracy theories about criminal civil servants and an obstructive \u201cblob\u201d. This is the line that will divide Labour from the Tories in next week\u2019s budget. No one expects a spectacular display of Treasury munificence. The chancellor will raise taxes, tweak fiscal rules to permit more borrowing and keep budgets tighter than her own side would like. On the right, Rachel Reeves will be denounced for reckless profligacy and on the left for cruel parsimony. She will be caricatured as Old Labour and Red Tory. She can\u2019t be both. There will be plenty to dispute about the pace of investment and the choice of priorities. (There always is.) Labour\u2019s options are limited by the pre-election strategy of shadowing Conservative spending plans and forswearing recourse to the Treasury\u2019s most powerful revenue-raising levers. Whether that was essential to secure victory is something for historians to debate without access to the counterfactual where Reeves and Starmer went to the polls promising tax hikes. What is beyond question \u2013 or should be \u2013 is that Labour\u2019s first budget in 15 years will represent a radical departure in the way Britain is governed. For the first time in so many years, serious government and a public sector deemed worthy of investment will be the whole point. The contrast will be even starker when the result of the Conservative leadership contest is declared the following week. Whether it is Jenrick or Badenoch, the Tories will have a leader whose guiding doctrine has been tested beyond destruction. Labour understands the role that public services play in the economic and social wellbeing of the nation; the Conservatives don\u2019t. Why is one of those parties in government and the other in opposition? It\u2019s not a trick question, even if the Tories refuse to see the obvious answer. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

The Trump campaign filed a legal complaint overnight against Labour officials travelling to US battleground states to volunteer for his Democrat rival Kamala Harris. The letter, which was sent to the US Federal Election Commission, said that these volunteering efforts and reports of contact between Labour and the Harris campaign amounted to \u201cillegal foreign national contributions\u201d. A statement on DonaldJTrump.com on Tuesday night claimed that the \u201cfar-left\u201d Labour party has \u201cinspired Kamala\u2019s dangerously liberal policies and rhetoric\u201d. In response Starmer insisted he had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Trump which would not be jeopardised by the complaint.

In that instance the US Federal Election Commission fined the ALP, which paid for its delegates\u2019 flights and gave them daily stipends, and the Sanders campaign $14,500 each.

She also argued that his face, which was not fully captured in the footage, was not looking in the direction of the blade.</p> <p>\u201cAt its highest, in my submission, [my client] may have seen, or may have had the knife in peripheral vision, but only in peripheral vision \u2013 and only for a short period of time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYour honour cannot discern, from this footage, that he in fact turned his face towards the knife at any point.\u201d</p> <p>Reece also argued that, even if the pair had formed a common intention to steal while armed, the evidence also proved her client withdrew that consent by attempting to prevent his companion\u2019s violence.</p> <p>Earlier Tuesday afternoon the prosecution had attempted to match audio taken from a neighbour\u2019s CCTV with the Lovell\u2019s vision-only footage to argue \u201clogic demanded\u201d that it was the accused\u2019s companion who uttered the words \u201cI\u2019ll kill you, I\u2019ll kill you too\u201d during the violent struggle on the front lawn.</p> <p>Reece, however, contended the word \u201ctoo\u201d was not clearly discernible and that, significantly, the audio also captured her client saying words to the effect of \u201cnah bra\u201d immediately afterwards.</p> <p>She played a clip which appeared to show her client running over to his companion kicking Lee Lovell as he lay on the ground.</p>    <p>\u201cStop, stop, stop,\u201d she contends her client exhorted his companion at this point. </p> <p>The pair then fled the scene, leaving both Emma and Lee Lovell slumped upon their lawn \u2013 he stabbed and beaten, she with her head in her knees, fatally wounded.</p> <p>Nardone had argued the purpose of bringing a knife to the home invasion could only have been to use it \u201cshould a confrontation arise\u201d, either to scare off a person \u201cor in fact to cause them serious harm so as to escape\u201d.</p> <p>He conceded that the actions of both teenagers captured by the CCTV \u201csuggest that their motivation was to escape\u201d the scene once the Lovells\u2019 dogs alerted them to the intruders and they confronted the pair.</p> <p>\u201cThat was not able to be easily achieved by [the accused] because of the persistence of Mr and Mrs Lovell during that confrontation,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cFailing to make good his escape the actions of [his companion] involve using the knife to penetrate Mrs Lovell\u2019s body.

      "bodyText": "The fate of an alleged accomplice in the December 2022 stabbing murder of Emma Lovell that shocked Queensland now rests in the hands of a judge after a three-day trial ended on Wednesday. Prosecutors did not argue that the accused teenager \u2013 who cannot be named for legal reasons as he was 17 years old on the night Lovell died of a stab wound to the chest on the front lawn of her home in North Lakes, north of Brisbane\u2019s CBD \u2013 ever wielded that fatal knife. Now 18, he pleaded not guilty to four charges, including murder and assault occasioning bodily harm on Monday. But crown prosecutor David Nardone said CCTV footage which captured the two-minute and 16-second struggle between Emma, her husband, Lee, and the two teenagers, around midnight on Boxing Day 2022, also clearly revealed the accused\u2019s companion showing \u2013 or even offering him \u2013 the 11.5cm serrated blade as the pair stood poised at the front door, about to enter the Lovell home. Given the two teenagers had already formed a common purpose to steal from the brick bungalow, the fact it was \u201cunavoidable\u201d that the accused saw his companion\u2019s blade meant he was, Nardone argued, \u201cjointly liable for possession of the knife\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThe killing was a probable consequence of the unlawful purpose to steal property from the dwelling while armed with a knife,\u201d Nardone told Justice Michael Copley KC in his closing submission on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cThe liability [of the accused] arises as either an aider or an encourager of the act completed by [his companion].\u201d But the prosecutor conceded a murder conviction rested entirely upon the fact that the accused knew his companion was armed. Defence barrister Laura Reece argued that the CCTV footage did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that her client did, in fact, see a knife that his companion may have been concealing in a Calvin Klein satchel bag throughout the evening in which they roamed the streets of Brisbane\u2019s outer northern suburbs with at least two other companions. Reece argued the infrared CCTV footage which the prosecution claimed showed the accused\u2019s companion holding the knife centimetres from his face did not accurately reflect the gloom in the Lovell\u2019s door well. She also argued that his face, which was not fully captured in the footage, was not looking in the direction of the blade. \u201cAt its highest, in my submission, [my client] may have seen, or may have had the knife in peripheral vision, but only in peripheral vision \u2013 and only for a short period of time,\u201d she said. \u201cYour honour cannot discern, from this footage, that he in fact turned his face towards the knife at any point.\u201d Reece also argued that, even if the pair had formed a common intention to steal while armed, the evidence also proved her client withdrew that consent by attempting to prevent his companion\u2019s violence. Earlier Tuesday afternoon the prosecution had attempted to match audio taken from a neighbour\u2019s CCTV with the Lovell\u2019s vision-only footage to argue \u201clogic demanded\u201d that it was the accused\u2019s companion who uttered the words \u201cI\u2019ll kill you, I\u2019ll kill you too\u201d during the violent struggle on the front lawn. Reece, however, contended the word \u201ctoo\u201d was not clearly discernible and that, significantly, the audio also captured her client saying words to the effect of \u201cnah bra\u201d immediately afterwards. She played a clip which appeared to show her client running over to his companion kicking Lee Lovell as he lay on the ground. \u201cStop, stop, stop,\u201d she contends her client exhorted his companion at this point. The pair then fled the scene, leaving both Emma and Lee Lovell slumped upon their lawn \u2013 he stabbed and beaten, she with her head in her knees, fatally wounded. Nardone had argued the purpose of bringing a knife to the home invasion could only have been to use it \u201cshould a confrontation arise\u201d, either to scare off a person \u201cor in fact to cause them serious harm so as to escape\u201d. He conceded that the actions of both teenagers captured by the CCTV \u201csuggest that their motivation was to escape\u201d the scene once the Lovells\u2019 dogs alerted them to the intruders and they confronted the pair. \u201cThat was not able to be easily achieved by [the accused] because of the persistence of Mr and Mrs Lovell during that confrontation,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cFailing to make good his escape the actions of [his companion] involve using the knife to penetrate Mrs Lovell\u2019s body. The location of that penetration was in a position where it would achieve most harm. \u201cPenetrating her heart.\u201d The defence barrister, however, said that although it appeared that Lee Lovell \u2013 who told the court on Monday it had been his intention to detain the intruders until police arrived \u2013 was attempting to put her client in a headlock, \u201cimmediately upon breaking free\u201d, her client \u201cran away\u201d. His companion, in contrast, kicked Lee after he was dazed and prone and after \u2013 he would later learn \u2013 he had been stabbed, demonstrating that her client\u2019s companion had now entered \u201cthe realms of gratuitous violence\u201d, Reece told the court. So even if there had been a shared intention of \u201cmeting out violence to make good an escape\u201d, her client\u2019s words and actions demonstrated he had withdrawn from any such \u201ccommon plan\u201d, she said. \u201cHe did not use violence himself to the Lovells after breaking free from Mr Lovell,\u201d she said of her client. \u201cHe cannot at any time be heard to encourage [his companion] to use a knife or force of any kind and, in my submission, the evidence is in fact quite the opposite, that he exhorted [his companion] to stop. \u201cThat he reacted when he heard the threats to kill and that he acted when he saw [his companion] kick Mr Lovell on the ground.\u201d While she argued her client may be found guilty of breaking into the Lovell\u2019s home, he ought be found not guilty of the charges of murder and assault. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, the murder trial was held before a judge rather than a jury, with Justice Copley alone to determine the verdict. The accused remains remanded in custody.",

      "bodyText": "Two weeks out from election day, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff has claimed his one-time boss \u201cfalls into the general definition of fascist\u201d. John Kelly, a former Marine general and presidential aide from 2017 to 2019, made the extraordinary intervention on Tuesday in a series of coordinated interviews. Speaking to the New York Times, he said the former Republican president \u201cprefers the dictator approach to government\u201d and is the \u201conly president that has all but rejected what America is all about\u201d. Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump\u2019s campaign, told the Times that Kelly\u2019s accounts were \u201cdebunked stories\u201d and that Kelly had \u201cbeclowned\u201d himself. Speaking to the Atlantic, Kelly recounted Trump saying he wished his military personnel showed him the same deference Nazi generals showed Adolf Hitler. Trump\u2019s campaign denied the exchange, with an adviser telling CNN: \u201cThis is absolutely false. President Trump never said this.\u201d Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz said the reported comments about Hitler\u2019s generals \u201cmakes me sick as hell\u201d. \u201cFolks, the guardrails are gone,\u201d Walz told a rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday. \u201cTrump is descending into this madness.\u201d Here\u2019s what else happened on Tuesday: Kamala Harris campaign updates Vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz held a rally with former president Barack Obama in Madison, Wisconsin, where he slammed Trump\u2019s staged campaign event at a Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s as a \u201cstunt\u201d and mocked Elon Musk for \u201cjumping around, skipping like a dipshit\u201d before holding another rally in Wisconsin that evening. Obama, meanwhile, ridiculed Trump\u2019s boasts on the economy and cast his rambling speeches as a sign of mental deterioration. \u201cYou\u2019d be worried if Grandpa was acting like this,\u201d said Obama. \u201cBut this is coming from someone who wants unchecked power.\u201d Eminem introduced Obama at a rally in Detroit later on Tuesday, where the Democratic powerhouse began his remarks with the opening lines of the rapper\u2019s hit track Lose Yourself. Bruce Springsteen will headline two concerts as part of a series that will hit every swing state, the Harris campaign confirmed. Harris herself said she has no doubt that the US was ready for a female president, in an interview with NBC News\u2019s Hallie Jackson. \u201cI\u2019m clearly a woman. I don\u2019t need to point that out to anyone,\u201d Harris said with a laugh. \u201cThe point that most people really care about is: can you do the job and, do you have a plan to actually focus on them?\u201d. Harris courted Hispanic voters promoting small business loans for Latino men, in an interview with Noticias Telemundo\u2019s Julio Vaqueiro. Harris pledged to drive more funds to community banks to help Latino men access small business loans. \u201cHispanic men often have more difficulty securing loans from banks because of their connections and the fact that things aren\u2019t necessarily set up so that they will qualify,\u201d she said. Donald Trump campaign updates Trump also pitched to Hispanic voters, holding a morning round table with Latino leaders at his golf resort in Doral, Florida. Trump hit familiar talking points but took his time in getting to issues of importance to the voting bloc. The event concluded with a group of prominent evangelists praying as they stood around Trump with their hands on his shoulders, while he sat with his eyes closed. At the same event, the former president hurled a series of personal attacks at his opponent, calling Harris \u201clazy as hell\u201d and \u201clow IQ\u201d. He was referring to Harris holding no public campaign events on Tuesday, instead recording the two interviews after a busy day of campaigning with Liz Cheney on Monday. At a later rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump continued the invective: \u201cDoes she drink? Is she on drugs?\u201d JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, dodged a question about whether he would strip immigrants with legal authorisation of their status while campaigning in Peoria, outside Phoenix, Arizona. Vance urged supporters to \u201cwork our rear ends off for the next two weeks\u201d to turn the swing state red. The Republican campaign filed an extraordinary complaint claiming the UK Labour party is interfering in the presidential election by recruiting and sending party members to campaign for Harris. It is understood that volunteers are campaigning in the US in their own personal time, rather in their capacity working for the Labour party. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Despite some setbacks, Republicans vowed to press ahead in bids to block some overseas ballots. Court rulings rejected Republic National Committee efforts to block some Americans living abroad from voting in North Carolina and Michigan but the party will keep up its aggressive legal campaign. The US economy is poised for stronger growth than many wealthy nations, the International Monetary Fund said in forecast. While not mentioning Trump by name, the IMF estimates that a shift towards \u201cundesirable\u201d industrial and trade policies could reduce global GDP by 0.5 percentage points in 2026. Arab Americans slightly favour Trump over Harris, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by the Arab News Research and Studies Unit along with YouGov, shows a deadlock in Michigan, a key battleground state with a large Arab American population.

      "bodyText": "For two weeks, Umm Hadi has been living a nightmare on repeat. It has been 12 years since she last saw her elder son, who was detained by Syrian soldiers at a border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. Now it has happened again. She says her younger son Hadi was at the al-Dabbousyia crossing on 7 October, attempting to flee Israeli airstrikes and cross back into Syria to try to reunite with his family, when he was arrested and taken away by government forces. Sitting in a refugee camp in an opposition-controlled area of north-west Syria, Umm Hadi is distraught. \u201cWe are just sitting here, waiting to hear his fate,\u201d she says. Umm Hadi says when the Israeli bombs began to fall, Hadi sent his family back to Syria but because he came from a village in regime-controlled territory, he had been too scared to return. Two weeks ago, after the airstrikes intensified, his fear of the regime was replaced by a greater fear that he would never see his children again, so he decided to make the crossing himself. \u201cHe was not involved with anything,\u201d his mother says. \u201cHe was just a worker trying to feed his family. I am terrified I will also lose him to the regime like his brother.\u201d Hadi and his family had been living in Lebanon for more than a decade, part of a 1.5 million-strong Syrian refugee population who sought shelter in neighbouring Lebanon after the start of the civil war in 2011. In the past month, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have reversed this refugee flow, pushing an estimated 425,000 people \u2013 mostly women and children \u2013 back over chaotic and overcrowded border crossings, according to the UN. About 70% of those making the crossing are Syrians, but Lebanese civilians \u2013 the majority thought to be from Hezbollah strongholds in south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley \u2013 have also sought safety in a country still beset by economic strife, division and violence. For many of the Syrians returning home after years of living in exile, the journey back home is a perilous one. At border crossings and checkpoints in regime territory, there have been reports of disappearances, interrogations, detentions, forced conscription, bribery, beatings and harassment of returning refugees. According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, there have been at least 23 documented cases of Syrian refugees who have been arrested and detained by government forces as they tried to move across Syria. Thousand of returning Syrians who are too fearful of the wrath of the regime or who have nothing to return to in their home cities, towns and villages, are having to navigate their way through regime territory to try to reach opposition-controlled areas in the north-west of the country. Asriya Awad, an 80-year-old Syrian woman, managed to cross over into opposition-controlled Idlib with 11 members of her family after a 10-day journey from Lebanon. \u201cWe had been living in Lebanon for 10 years but we had to leave because missiles were falling on us,\u201d she says. \u201cWe left without taking anything with us, only the women and children of our family. We crossed at Jusiyah and I saw with my own eyes security personnel at the border assaulting young men, making them get off the buses and arresting them. \u201cMy daughter-in-law and her daughters were detained and we had to pay another $1,000 for their release. Our village is under the control of the regime and our house has been destroyed. On the way here, a young man from our village was taken away by soldiers, so we had to flee to the Idlib camps as it is not safe to go back.\u201d Farid Suleiman and his wife, Haifaa Salal, also managed to make their way through Syria to reach Idlib, after a desperate and dangerous journey from Lebanon. \u201cWe have seven children and we did not want to go back to Syria but we had nowhere to go because the shelters in Lebanon would not accept us,\u201d he says. After surviving multiple bombing attacks in Lebanon, Farid and Haifaa Salal first took their family to the Masnaa border crossing but say they were beaten by guards when they could not provide them with the correct paperwork, which had been destroyed in an Israeli attack. Farid says they were forced to pay smugglers to try to get them across the border but the road they were on was bombed by the Israelis as they were attempting to cross. \u201cGlass flew towards my children and almost killed them,\u201d he says. When they finally managed to enter Syria, Farid says he was pulled off a bus at a checkpoint and arrested, and was only released after Haifaa Salal gave the soldiers her jewellery. \u201cThe situation at all of the crossings and checkpoints is terrible because of the intimidation and exploitation,\u201d says Haifaa Salal. \u201cNothing terrified me more than the fear of my husband being arrested, but the situation for women [travelling alone] is very difficult. We saw three women forced off buses and taken away by soldiers who didn\u2019t come back.\u201d Now, even though they have survived the bombs and the checkpoints, the situation for many of the returning refugees seeking shelter in Idlib is grim.

      "body": "<p>At the height of the first pandemic summer in 2020, I sent more than \u00a318,000 to a scammer. Back then, I\u2019d never heard of the kind of con that ensnared me, though I later learned it was a classic of the genre: a call from my bank\u2019s \u201cfraud team\u201d warning of \u201csuspicious activity\u201d on my account, followed by instructions to move my vulnerable funds into a new \u201csafe\u201d account. Later that night, my housemate stared in horror as I explained the conversation I\u2019d had with a nice man from the bank. \u201cMoya,\u201d he said, aghast. \u201cThat was a scam.\u201d By the time I understood what had happened, it was too late. Each of my three bank accounts read \u00a30.00.</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, I felt as though my mind was disintegrating. I had struggled sporadically with anxiety for years, but that had always come on subtly, sneakily, like smoke creeping under a door. This was psychological devastation of a different order, more akin to being clubbed around the head. I was 28, and every imagined future version of my life had been predicated on those savings. Now, I believed those futures had been suddenly and violently erased. If I wasn\u2019t sobbing and vomiting on the street, I felt numb and dissociated, as if I was floating above myself. For the first time in my life, I wished I didn\u2019t have to wake up in the morning. I didn\u2019t want to be dead, but I didn\u2019t want to have to exist, either.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Every future version of my life had been predicated on those savings. Now, I believed those futures had been suddenly and violently erased</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the end, I was lucky: my bank reimbursed me in full. But since then, whenever I have seen headlines highlighting the staggering level of scams and fraud in the UK, I have thought about the people behind the numbers. According to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2024-06/UK%2520Finance%2520Annual%2520Fraud%2520report%25202024.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1728994868346033&amp;usg=AOvVaw1xbj-FBaKy6NM_smMLMZNP\">a report</a> from UK Finance, in 2023, \u00a3459.7m was lost in cases of \u201cauthorised\u201d fraud, where the victim is tricked into sending money to a fraudster. Confirmed cases are up more than 50% since 2020. </p> <p>Against the backdrop of the UK\u2019s mental health crisis, experts are increasingly sounding the alarm about the impact of scams on victims\u2019 psyches. Recent research by Which? shows that three in five UK fraud victims say their mental health was negatively affected by the experience, while a separate, not-yet-published survey by Lloyds found 69% of fraud victims experienced a decline in their mental health. Anxiety, depression and low self-esteem are <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/money/research-reveals-mental-and-physical-impact-of-fraud-on-victims-wellbeing-b2516069.html\">commonly reported</a> by fraud victims whose mental health is affected. Prof Mark Button, the director of the Centre for Cybercrime and Economic Crime at the University of Portsmouth, says he is aware of \u201clots of cases\u201d where someone has killed themself \u201cas a result of fraud victimisation\u201d.</p> <p>On one level, this isn\u2019t surprising. We know <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/lifes-challenges/money-worries-mental-health/\">financial strain is linked to mental ill health</a>, and it is not unreasonable to assume that a person might struggle following a crime that hurts their bank balance. But experts say the connection between scams and psychological wellbeing is more complex.</p> <p>\u201cYou might say, if you\u2019ve lost \u00a320,000, that must be awfully traumatic,\u201d says Wayne Stevens, the national fraud lead at Victim Support. \u201cBut actually, we see people losing those sums of money who managed to ride it out, and then people losing a 10th of that amount [where] it has a devastating effect on them.\u201d Our response to a scam is not usually shaped by financial loss, Stevens says, but by factors including \u201chow connected we are with our family, our friends or our community; whether we\u2019ve got other things going on in our lives, [such as] bereavements and employment [issues or] insecure housing; or whether we\u2019ve experienced personal trauma\u201d.</p>    <p>Even in cases where a scam fails, the psychological impact can be profound. Funmi (not her real name), who is 78 and from London, was recently the victim of an attempted computer takeover scam. \u201cI kept getting an alert, purporting to be from a legit cybersecurity firm, telling me to enter my details to protect my computer,\u201d says the retired teacher, who has been on medication and in therapy for anxiety since the 1980s. Funmi often worries about her online security, and she followed the alert\u2019s instructions. Suddenly, the scammer had control of her computer. \u201cI could see the cursor going everywhere. Then [the scammer] was in my PayPal, and I thought, oh my God.\u201d</p> <p>The scammer tried to steal only \u00a335 from Funmi and her bank immediately blocked the transaction. But the experience has still \u201cramped up\u201d her anxiety, especially as she is now being bombarded with phishing texts and emails. (Fraudsters are <a href=\"https://stopthinkfraud.campaign.gov.uk/recovery-from-fraud/recovering-losses/what-to-do-if-youve-shared-personal-information/#:~:text=Be%20on%20your%20guard%20for%20further%20fraud&amp;text=This%20is%20because%20fraudsters%20add,passwords%20(OTPs)%20and%20PINs.\">known</a> to sell lists of victims\u2019 details to other criminals.) \u201cI feel so vulnerable \u2013 my phone has become a device of horror and dread,\u201d Funmi says. \u201cI feel paranoid about everything.\u201d</p> <p>Paranoia is a common response in the wake of a scam, and it can be difficult to shake. Stefan Walters, a psychotherapist and registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, says he has noticed an increase in recent years of clients wanting to discuss being scammed. Falling victim to a scam or fraud, he explains, can force us to reassess our \u201cinternal working model\u201d, or the unconscious beliefs we hold about ourselves and others. \u201cWe may think: \u2018Is the world around me full of people I could trust and who have good intentions? Or is it full of people who are out to get me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After being scammed, we might also \u201cstart to look at ourselves and say: \u2018Am I a good character? Do I know what to look for in people? Maybe I\u2019m really gullible,\u2019\u201d Walters continues. \u201cWe start to doubt not only other people, but also ourselves.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I was very clued up. I would be the person to warn someone: \u2018That\u2019s a scam, it doesn\u2019t sound right.\u2019 And yet here I am</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Des Healey, 59, from Peacehaven in East Sussex, being scammed hasn\u2019t just meant financial loss \u2013 it has fundamentally challenged his sense of self. The scam started when he clicked on a Facebook advert for an \u201cAI cryptocurrency platform\u201d in August 2023. Encouraged by nightly phone conversations with an affable man posing as his financial adviser, and reassured by the platform\u2019s apparent endorsements from Elon Musk and Martin Lewis, Healey began investing increasingly large sums, ultimately losing \u00a376,000.</p> <p>Since the scam, Healey has struggled with symptoms of depression, anxiety and paranoia. When he started to cry during an appointment with his GP about a physical health issue, the doctor concluded he was probably experiencing bodily reactions to the mental toll of the scam.</p> <p>Healey comes across as confident and canny. He raised his son as a single parent, runs his own business fitting bathrooms and kitchens, and until the scam had an excellent credit rating. \u201cI did think I was very streetwise,\u201d he says. \u201cI would be the person to warn someone: \u2018That\u2019s a scam, it doesn\u2019t sound right.\u2019 And yet here I am.\u201d</p> <p>In the aftermath of a scam, the process of trying to get their money back can make victims feel even worse. Button says the multiple agencies involved in preventing and responding to scams \u2013 including financial institutions, telecoms companies and tech platforms \u2013 are not sufficiently \u201cjoined up\u201d, meaning it is essentially \u201ca lottery whether someone will get the true support that they need\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.nationaltradingstandards.uk/news/19-million-lose-money-to-scams-but-fewer-than-a-third-report/\">Research</a> by National Trading Standards shows that among the minority of victims who report the crime to the authorities, almost half (47%) say they were made to feel \u201cstupid or embarrassed\u201d. Only 34% felt \u201cfully heard and understood\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2019, most UK high street banks have signed up to a voluntary code that outlines how they should refund victims of bank transfer scams (also known as \u201cauthorised push payment\u201d or APP fraud). Banks can refuse to reimburse victims if they are judged to have been \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d \u2013 meaning, in lay terms, they should have twigged they were being had. A <a href=\"https://www.psr.org.uk/media/kwlgyzti/ps23-4-app-scams-policy-statement-dec-2023.pdf\">recent rule change</a> means all UK banks must<em> </em>now refund APP fraud victims within five days. But as the gross negligence <a href=\"https://www.psr.org.uk/news-and-updates/latest-news/news/groundbreaking-new-protections-for-victims-of-app-scams-start-today/\">caveat remains</a>, many victims will still lose out.</p> <p>Margaret (not her real name), 73, who is retired and lives in Cheshire, fell victim to an impersonation scam similar to the one that affected me. She transferred \u00a319,800 to the criminals, much of which had been left to her by her husband after his death last year. Margaret\u2019s bank refused to reimburse her, saying she should have known it was a scam. The fraudsters had coached her to lie when real bank staff questioned the transfer.</p> <p>When you are the target of such a stigmatised crime, it can be excruciating to be blamed by your bank on top of everything else. Feeling \u201cabsolutely stupid\u201d and worried about being judged, Margaret confided in just two people outside her immediate family about the scam. <a href=\"https://www.nationaltradingstandards.uk/news/19-million-lose-money-to-scams-but-fewer-than-a-third-report/\">Two-thirds</a> of scam victims don\u2019t disclose the experience to anyone at all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Shame shuts us down. It stops us from reaching out to get the help that would make us feel a bit better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The psychologist and trauma specialist Dr Heather Sequeira says the shame experienced by some people after a scam has parallels with \u201cother forms of trauma, such as sexual trauma or domestic violence\u201d, where victims are often blamed. Margaret says the scam left her feeling \u201cviolated and abused\u201d, phrasing that is entirely appropriate: a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/63/6/1405/7001906?login=false\">study</a> published in the British Journal of Criminology<em> </em>highlights striking similarities between the manipulative language used by fraudsters and perpetrators of coercive control. \u201cIn the same way that a victim of domestic abuse may think, \u2018It\u2019s my fault, I let him in my house\u2019, a scam victim might say, \u2018I didn\u2019t read that properly\u2019, or \u2018I signed it,\u2019\u201d says Sequeira, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society. The shame \u201cshuts us down\u201d, she says. \u201cIt stops us from reaching out to get the help that would make us feel a bit better.\u201d</p> <p>Even with the recent changes to reimbursement rules, experts say scam victims in the UK are getting a raw deal. Banks aren\u2019t obliged to refund victims for amounts above \u00a385,000 \u2013 even though the organisation behind the rule change, the Payment Systems Regulator, has <a href=\"https://www.psr.org.uk/media/zrtnl000/ps24-7-app-scams-max-claim-limit-cba-oct-2024.pdf\">acknowledged</a> this could \u201c[heighten] the psychological and emotional harm\u201d caused to scam victims. Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, says the reimbursement limit is \u201cvery disappointing. More needs to be done to lessen the unfair psychological burden on scam victims.\u201d The government should lead a \u201cmore coordinated approach\u201d on this issue, she adds.</p> <p>Until then? \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/01/talking-about-mental-illness-is-no-substitute-for-offering-real-help\">Starting the conversation</a>\u201d may not be the solution to all mental health struggles, but in the context of scams, speaking to others can be like letting light and air into a dark, shuttered room. Some UK police forces now run peer support programmes for fraud victims, an approach many experts would like to see rolled out more widely. But there is power in talking about the emotional and mental impact of scams in our everyday lives, too. As a lifelong yapper, I was open about being scammed from the start, and found relief and solidarity in commiserating with other victims. These conversations took place mostly on social media, and helped me process my initial feelings of shock and humiliation into a cold and righteous anger. When I was fighting to get my money back, I needed that anger as fuel.</p> <p>Healey, the only scam victim I spoke to for this piece who wanted to be quoted under his real name, also refuses to be shamed into silence. \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t want to tell anybody,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt so embarrassed. But in the end, I thought to myself, why am I hiding what\u2019s happened? I\u2019m not the perpetrator. I\u2019m the victim.\u201d Through conversations with friends, colleagues and neighbours, Healey realised just how common scams are: they are happening to people of all ages and backgrounds, every day. That has helped him to stop blaming himself. \u201cI still owe an extortionate amount of money,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I started to talk about it, I felt a release.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If you have been the victim of a scam, you can access free advice and support through <a href=\"https://www.victimsupport.org.uk/\">Victim Support</a>.

      "bodyText": "At the height of the first pandemic summer in 2020, I sent more than \u00a318,000 to a scammer. Back then, I\u2019d never heard of the kind of con that ensnared me, though I later learned it was a classic of the genre: a call from my bank\u2019s \u201cfraud team\u201d warning of \u201csuspicious activity\u201d on my account, followed by instructions to move my vulnerable funds into a new \u201csafe\u201d account. Later that night, my housemate stared in horror as I explained the conversation I\u2019d had with a nice man from the bank. \u201cMoya,\u201d he said, aghast. \u201cThat was a scam.\u201d By the time I understood what had happened, it was too late. Each of my three bank accounts read \u00a30.00. In the weeks that followed, I felt as though my mind was disintegrating. I had struggled sporadically with anxiety for years, but that had always come on subtly, sneakily, like smoke creeping under a door. This was psychological devastation of a different order, more akin to being clubbed around the head. I was 28, and every imagined future version of my life had been predicated on those savings. Now, I believed those futures had been suddenly and violently erased. If I wasn\u2019t sobbing and vomiting on the street, I felt numb and dissociated, as if I was floating above myself. For the first time in my life, I wished I didn\u2019t have to wake up in the morning. I didn\u2019t want to be dead, but I didn\u2019t want to have to exist, either. In the end, I was lucky: my bank reimbursed me in full. But since then, whenever I have seen headlines highlighting the staggering level of scams and fraud in the UK, I have thought about the people behind the numbers. According to a report from UK Finance, in 2023, \u00a3459.7m was lost in cases of \u201cauthorised\u201d fraud, where the victim is tricked into sending money to a fraudster. Confirmed cases are up more than 50% since 2020. Against the backdrop of the UK\u2019s mental health crisis, experts are increasingly sounding the alarm about the impact of scams on victims\u2019 psyches. Recent research by Which? shows that three in five UK fraud victims say their mental health was negatively affected by the experience, while a separate, not-yet-published survey by Lloyds found 69% of fraud victims experienced a decline in their mental health. Anxiety, depression and low self-esteem are commonly reported by fraud victims whose mental health is affected. Prof Mark Button, the director of the Centre for Cybercrime and Economic Crime at the University of Portsmouth, says he is aware of \u201clots of cases\u201d where someone has killed themself \u201cas a result of fraud victimisation\u201d. On one level, this isn\u2019t surprising. We know financial strain is linked to mental ill health, and it is not unreasonable to assume that a person might struggle following a crime that hurts their bank balance. But experts say the connection between scams and psychological wellbeing is more complex. \u201cYou might say, if you\u2019ve lost \u00a320,000, that must be awfully traumatic,\u201d says Wayne Stevens, the national fraud lead at Victim Support. \u201cBut actually, we see people losing those sums of money who managed to ride it out, and then people losing a 10th of that amount [where] it has a devastating effect on them.\u201d Our response to a scam is not usually shaped by financial loss, Stevens says, but by factors including \u201chow connected we are with our family, our friends or our community; whether we\u2019ve got other things going on in our lives, [such as] bereavements and employment [issues or] insecure housing; or whether we\u2019ve experienced personal trauma\u201d. Even in cases where a scam fails, the psychological impact can be profound. Funmi (not her real name), who is 78 and from London, was recently the victim of an attempted computer takeover scam. \u201cI kept getting an alert, purporting to be from a legit cybersecurity firm, telling me to enter my details to protect my computer,\u201d says the retired teacher, who has been on medication and in therapy for anxiety since the 1980s. Funmi often worries about her online security, and she followed the alert\u2019s instructions. Suddenly, the scammer had control of her computer. \u201cI could see the cursor going everywhere. Then [the scammer] was in my PayPal, and I thought, oh my God.\u201d The scammer tried to steal only \u00a335 from Funmi and her bank immediately blocked the transaction. But the experience has still \u201cramped up\u201d her anxiety, especially as she is now being bombarded with phishing texts and emails. (Fraudsters are known to sell lists of victims\u2019 details to other criminals.) \u201cI feel so vulnerable \u2013 my phone has become a device of horror and dread,\u201d Funmi says. \u201cI feel paranoid about everything.\u201d Paranoia is a common response in the wake of a scam, and it can be difficult to shake. Stefan Walters, a psychotherapist and registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, says he has noticed an increase in recent years of clients wanting to discuss being scammed. Falling victim to a scam or fraud, he explains, can force us to reassess our \u201cinternal working model\u201d, or the unconscious beliefs we hold about ourselves and others. \u201cWe may think: \u2018Is the world around me full of people I could trust and who have good intentions? Or is it full of people who are out to get me?\u2019\u201d After being scammed, we might also \u201cstart to look at ourselves and say: \u2018Am I a good character? Do I know what to look for in people? Maybe I\u2019m really gullible,\u2019\u201d Walters continues. \u201cWe start to doubt not only other people, but also ourselves.\u201d For Des Healey, 59, from Peacehaven in East Sussex, being scammed hasn\u2019t just meant financial loss \u2013 it has fundamentally challenged his sense of self. The scam started when he clicked on a Facebook advert for an \u201cAI cryptocurrency platform\u201d in August 2023. Encouraged by nightly phone conversations with an affable man posing as his financial adviser, and reassured by the platform\u2019s apparent endorsements from Elon Musk and Martin Lewis, Healey began investing increasingly large sums, ultimately losing \u00a376,000. Since the scam, Healey has struggled with symptoms of depression, anxiety and paranoia. When he started to cry during an appointment with his GP about a physical health issue, the doctor concluded he was probably experiencing bodily reactions to the mental toll of the scam. Healey comes across as confident and canny. He raised his son as a single parent, runs his own business fitting bathrooms and kitchens, and until the scam had an excellent credit rating. \u201cI did think I was very streetwise,\u201d he says. \u201cI would be the person to warn someone: \u2018That\u2019s a scam, it doesn\u2019t sound right.\u2019 And yet here I am.\u201d In the aftermath of a scam, the process of trying to get their money back can make victims feel even worse. Button says the multiple agencies involved in preventing and responding to scams \u2013 including financial institutions, telecoms companies and tech platforms \u2013 are not sufficiently \u201cjoined up\u201d, meaning it is essentially \u201ca lottery whether someone will get the true support that they need\u201d. Research by National Trading Standards shows that among the minority of victims who report the crime to the authorities, almost half (47%) say they were made to feel \u201cstupid or embarrassed\u201d. Only 34% felt \u201cfully heard and understood\u201d. Since 2019, most UK high street banks have signed up to a voluntary code that outlines how they should refund victims of bank transfer scams (also known as \u201cauthorised push payment\u201d or APP fraud). Banks can refuse to reimburse victims if they are judged to have been \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d \u2013 meaning, in lay terms, they should have twigged they were being had. A recent rule change means all UK banks must now refund APP fraud victims within five days. But as the gross negligence caveat remains, many victims will still lose out. Margaret (not her real name), 73, who is retired and lives in Cheshire, fell victim to an impersonation scam similar to the one that affected me. She transferred \u00a319,800 to the criminals, much of which had been left to her by her husband after his death last year. Margaret\u2019s bank refused to reimburse her, saying she should have known it was a scam. The fraudsters had coached her to lie when real bank staff questioned the transfer. When you are the target of such a stigmatised crime, it can be excruciating to be blamed by your bank on top of everything else. Feeling \u201cabsolutely stupid\u201d and worried about being judged, Margaret confided in just two people outside her immediate family about the scam. Two-thirds of scam victims don\u2019t disclose the experience to anyone at all. The psychologist and trauma specialist Dr Heather Sequeira says the shame experienced by some people after a scam has parallels with \u201cother forms of trauma, such as sexual trauma or domestic violence\u201d, where victims are often blamed. Margaret says the scam left her feeling \u201cviolated and abused\u201d, phrasing that is entirely appropriate: a study published in the British Journal of Criminology highlights striking similarities between the manipulative language used by fraudsters and perpetrators of coercive control. \u201cIn the same way that a victim of domestic abuse may think, \u2018It\u2019s my fault, I let him in my house\u2019, a scam victim might say, \u2018I didn\u2019t read that properly\u2019, or \u2018I signed it,\u2019\u201d says Sequeira, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society. The shame \u201cshuts us down\u201d, she says. \u201cIt stops us from reaching out to get the help that would make us feel a bit better.\u201d Even with the recent changes to reimbursement rules, experts say scam victims in the UK are getting a raw deal. Banks aren\u2019t obliged to refund victims for amounts above \u00a385,000 \u2013 even though the organisation behind the rule change, the Payment Systems Regulator, has acknowledged this could \u201c[heighten] the psychological and emotional harm\u201d caused to scam victims. Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, says the reimbursement limit is \u201cvery disappointing. More needs to be done to lessen the unfair psychological burden on scam victims.\u201d The government should lead a \u201cmore coordinated approach\u201d on this issue, she adds. Until then? \u201cStarting the conversation\u201d may not be the solution to all mental health struggles, but in the context of scams, speaking to others can be like letting light and air into a dark, shuttered room. Some UK police forces now run peer support programmes for fraud victims, an approach many experts would like to see rolled out more widely. But there is power in talking about the emotional and mental impact of scams in our everyday lives, too. As a lifelong yapper, I was open about being scammed from the start, and found relief and solidarity in commiserating with other victims. These conversations took place mostly on social media, and helped me process my initial feelings of shock and humiliation into a cold and righteous anger. When I was fighting to get my money back, I needed that anger as fuel. Healey, the only scam victim I spoke to for this piece who wanted to be quoted under his real name, also refuses to be shamed into silence. \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t want to tell anybody,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt so embarrassed. But in the end, I thought to myself, why am I hiding what\u2019s happened? I\u2019m not the perpetrator. I\u2019m the victim.\u201d Through conversations with friends, colleagues and neighbours, Healey realised just how common scams are: they are happening to people of all ages and backgrounds, every day. That has helped him to stop blaming himself. \u201cI still owe an extortionate amount of money,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I started to talk about it, I felt a release.\u201d \u2022 If you have been the victim of a scam, you can access free advice and support through Victim Support.

The mayors, most of whom are Labour, are engaged in a last-minute lobbying campaign to stop the Treasury raiding their transport budgets as Rachel Reeves looks for immediate savings. Officials say that without this moneybus subsidies, rolling out electric buses and schemes to increase walking and cycling could all be delayed or cut. \u201cThe mayors have been pushing back on the idea that their sustainable budgets should be cut, not least because many of them thought the money was guaranteed until 2027,\u201d said one official. One mayoral aide said: \u201cWe\u2019re worried about what might happen in the budget on transport funding. There are rumours flying around and it\u2019s destabilising.\u201d A government source said there were no plans to change so-called city region sustainable transport settlements, which provide multi-year packages for some transport schemes, but declined to speculate what else might happen. The chancellor will announce a spending review to cover this financial year and next at the same time as her 30 October budget, and is looking for billions of pounds in cuts to cover what she says is a \u00a322bn shortfall in the government accounts. Negotiations have been fraught, not least because cabinet ministers have argued their capital spending allocations should be protected given Reeves has promised to invest in infrastructure in the long term. Last week, three cabinet ministers \u2013 the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood; the deputy party leader and housing secretary, Angela Rayner; and the transport secretary, Louise Haigh \u2013 wrote to Keir Starmer to complain about the spending reductions they were being asked to make. Secretaries of state have now agreed their overall funding settlements, though not every individual programme has been tied down yet. Mayors are lobbying heavily to make sure their transport budgets are not cut back, especially in areas where the money has already been allocated as part of nationally agreed sustainable transport schemes. Billions of pounds have already been allocated in settlements due to last until 2027: funding schemes such as train improvements and electrification of bus depots to charge new zero-emission buses. Industry sources believe Reeves is looking in particular at reducing an additional \u00a35bn Rishi Sunak promised to city regions after axing the northern leg of HS2. Sunak then called the scheme a \u201cnew plan for transport that will transform roads, rail and buses across the north\u201d. Experts said at the time, however, his promises had not been properly funded. In London, where day-to-day spending is funded solely through fares and other operating income such as the congestion charge, and the Treasury is asked to help fund capital spending, Sadiq Khan is said to be concerned that squeezed budgets could delay tube line extensions. The capital\u2019s mayor has asked the Treasury for what he believes will be enough money to fulfil contracts that have already been signed, including to upgrade the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines, as well as new buses. Several mayors worried they may have to raise fares to pay for the work needed. The government has provided money for several mayoral authorities to cap bus fares at \u00a32, and some fear funding will not be renewed after it runs out at the end of the year, leaving them the choice of raising fares or cutting other programmes. Mayors in several city regions have been reallocating capital spending to cover day-to-day costs such as the fare cap, and are worried they will not be able to do so in the future. The Labour West Midlands mayor, Richard Parker, is understood to be particularly concerned about bus services, which the combined authority is subsidising by \u00a350m-\u00a370m a year. Though the current budget for sustainable transport is not being cut, local leaders believe the Department for Transport is hoping that some of the agreed budget can be used to continue to fill the bus revenue funding gap, meaning cuts elsewhere.

But there are concerns among professionals here that the bill could have unintended consequences in these communities.</p> <p>According to the 2021 census, 30.5% of Bradford\u2019s population identified as Muslim, the highest proportion in any UK city. \u201cThe concept of assisted dying doesn\u2019t necessarily exist within the Muslim culture,\u201d said Rashad Bokhari, the CEO of the Bradford Council of Mosques.</p> <p>\u201cThe general perspective from an Islamic point of view, is very much \u2026 life is a gift from God. So God gives you life. God takes the life.\u201d</p> <p>Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, said she would vote against the bill, as it is incompatible with her faith.</p> <p>Defying Cabinet Office advice for the government to remain neutral on the issue, she said that death is \u201cnot a service that the state should be offering\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs a Muslim, I have an unshakeable belief in the sanctity and the value of human life,\u201d she told the Times.</p> <p>But as well as being an issue of conscience for the city\u2019s Muslims, the bill also comes against a backdrop in which faith and trust in the medical professional was eroded during the Covid pandemic, and where inequalities already exist in end-of-life care that some say are at risk of being deepened.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest barrier to good end-of-life care, including for those who don\u2019t want their lives prolonged, are the huge inequalities in access to palliative care across the country,\u201d said Jamilla Hussain, a consultant in palliative medicine at Bradford teaching hospitals NHS trust.</p> <p>\u201cThe provision is patchy. We\u2019re still very much relying on bake sales to fund our services, and we know every year over 100,000 people who need palliative care don\u2019t get access to it.</p> <p>\u201cWe know on top of that, people from ethnic minority backgrounds and those from more disadvantaged backgrounds, are some of the least likely to access our services,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Hussain, also an academic, is leading two nationally funded studies in Bradford: one addressing racism at the end of life and another looking at how minority ethnic people with frailty may be affected by prejudice and discrimination in their last years and months.</p>    <p>She said she has no moral objection to assisted dying, but among her professional concerns are that if it were on the table, it may lead to people who are fundamentally opposed to the practice being fearful to access end-of-life care.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the Muslim community,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve discussed this with groups supporting the Roma community and the Black Caribbean communities too.

Hussain, also an academic, is leading two nationally funded studies in Bradford: one addressing racism at the end of life and another looking at how minority ethnic people with frailty may be affected by prejudice and discrimination in their last years and months. She said she has no moral objection to assisted dying, but among her professional concerns are that if it were on the table, it may lead to people who are fundamentally opposed to the practice being fearful to access end-of-life care. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the Muslim community,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve discussed this with groups supporting the Roma community and the Black Caribbean communities too.

      "bodyText": "Western Australia sometimes feels more than three hours behind the rest of the country. The tyranny of our distance has always meant it\u2019s been hard to get the attention of the east coast. For West Australians, this has famously led to a secessionist streak that re-emerged spectacularly during the start of the pandemic, when we were truly cut off. Even now, on a regular basis, WA becomes severed from the rest of Australia when fire or flood cuts the tenuous road and rail links connecting us across the Nullarbor. But most of Australia has been asleep at the wheel while WA has taken control of environmental policies, driving the political conversation ahead of overlapping WA and federal elections. And not in a good direction. In recent months, it has become clear that federal Labor\u2019s flagship national nature laws reforms have become stuck in limbo. Last month, the West Australian newspaper \u2013 owned by a company with substantial mining and gas interests \u2013 ran a front page that labelled the Albanese government \u201can enemy of the state\u201d. Just hours later, nature positive legislation was pulled from the Senate, and hasn\u2019t returned. This came after the premier, Roger Cook, bragged about giving the prime minister the hard word while flanked by leading resources CEOs; he then dispatched WA\u2019s environment minister to Canberra to follow up the lobbying. WA is already the only state in the country where emissions continue to increase, but it\u2019s also the only state with no targets to reduce them or replace them with renewable energy. The WA government has also indefinitely deferred their flagship climate legislation, which was an election commitment in 2021 but seems unlikely to pass before the next election in 2025.

On Tuesday, the WA environment minister, Reece Whitby, stood up in parliament and, without any notice, consultation or debate, announced that the WA government was changing its policy around major projects and would no longer seek to regulate their greenhouse gas emissions. This overthrows decades of consensus that the state government has a role to play in mitigating the climate impacts of big-emitting projects. Whitby cited the federal safeguard mechanism as rendering state-based conditions redundant, but the safeguard mechanism by itself is too weak to even return WA\u2019s soaring emissions to their 2005 baseline by 2030. Just two days later the state government doubled down by passing sweeping reforms to WA\u2019s Environmental Protection Authority itself, following a snap review that failed to consult with any environmental groups. The government described the changes as an attempt to \u201cslash green tape\u201d by fast-tracking project approvals and allowing the EPA board to be filled with industry representatives and giving the government explicit power to direct the EPA\u2019s priorities. Retiring WA Labor MP, Chris Tallentire, described these reforms as \u201can industry wish-list.\u201d And in the midst of all this, WA Labor also appointed a new chair of the hamstrung EPA \u2013 a former consultant who has stated, as an EPA board member, that \u201cmy job is to actually help [projects] through the process as quickly as possible\u201d. These changes to WA\u2019s nature watchdog is in the context of pending approvals for large parts of the biggest fossil fuel project in Australia \u2013 Woodside\u2019s Burrup Hub, which they are seeking to expand until 2070. In August, the EPA warned Woodside that its Browse gas proposal was \u201cunacceptable\u201d due to multiple serious environmental risks. Since then, the WA government has launched an ongoing assault on any protections against the impacts of the WA gas industry on our nature and climate. It is dangerous for the country and dangerous for the world, and it needs to be called out. Two elections in the next seven months will provide an opportunity for Australia\u2019s voters to have their say and to hold Labor to their public commitments to seriously address climate change.

At that event, he repeated debunked claims that Haitians in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/springfield-ohio-republicans-haitian-immigrants-lies\">Springfield, Ohio</a>, were eating pets and \u201cother things too that they\u2019re not supposed to\u201d.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s audience, a gallery of pre-screened ultra-loyalists at Trump National Doral, appeared unconcerned by the lack of a dialogue, cheering loudly at every insult. Trump called Harris \u201ca stupid person\u201d as he falsely labeled her Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cborder tsar\u201d during a brief section on immigration.</p> <p>His remarks segued quickly into an attack on Democrats for allegedly allowing transgender athletes to play women\u2019s sports, and he told a somewhat fanciful tale of \u201ca man who transitioned into, congratulations, a woman\u201d smashing a baseball so hard it hit a female player on the head and \u201cthese young ladies said they\u2019d never seen anything like it\u201d.</p> <p>Calling Harris a \u201cradical-left lunatic\u201d, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s a sickness going on in our country.

You\u2019re not doing it for anything, but because you love this country. You love us, and we love you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Unanue was not the only Latino business figure heaping praise. Joel Garza, owner of multiple Sonic fast-food franchises and another <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/09/17/hispanic-owner-thanks-trump/\">veteran of the Trump podium</a>, said the former president needed to be re-elected to \u201chelp us with banks [and] stop regulations\u201d.</p> <p>The ultimate adulation, however, came at the conclusion of the roundtable when a group of religious leaders stood around Trump, who was seated at the table, eyes closed, with their hands on his shoulders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/18/election-trump-michigan-latino-voters\">\u2018They don\u2019t think he\u2019s talking about them\u2019: Trump support rises with Latinos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe lift up the man that we believe you\u2019ve put your hand upon to help restore America and bring America back to the place that honors you,\u201d Ramiro Pe\u00f1a, one of Trump\u2019s most influential Latino evangelists, said in a direct appeal to the heavens.</p> <p>The Honduran televangelist Guillermo Maldonado, founder of the Miami megachurch the King Jesus International Ministry, closed out the event with a prediction Trump would defeat Harris because \u201cthere\u2019s a higher assignment for him to finish with this nation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a war between good and evil,\u201d he insisted. \u201cGod sets up kings.

Perhaps with this in mind, Trump was directly appealing to the Latino bloc for the second time in less than a week at Tuesday\u2019s roundtable. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about what\u2019s happening with the election. We\u2019ll take some questions from the fake news,\u201d he said after a raucous welcome to the stage. Ultimately, he took none, ensuring he would avoid a repeat of his misfire at a town hall hosted by Univision, the largest US Spanish-language network, in Miami last Thursday when he mostly dodged awkward questions about immigration from undecided voters. At that event, he repeated debunked claims that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets and \u201cother things too that they\u2019re not supposed to\u201d. Tuesday\u2019s audience, a gallery of pre-screened ultra-loyalists at Trump National Doral, appeared unconcerned by the lack of a dialogue, cheering loudly at every insult. Trump called Harris \u201ca stupid person\u201d as he falsely labeled her Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cborder tsar\u201d during a brief section on immigration. His remarks segued quickly into an attack on Democrats for allegedly allowing transgender athletes to play women\u2019s sports, and he told a somewhat fanciful tale of \u201ca man who transitioned into, congratulations, a woman\u201d smashing a baseball so hard it hit a female player on the head and \u201cthese young ladies said they\u2019d never seen anything like it\u201d. Calling Harris a \u201cradical-left lunatic\u201d, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s a sickness going on in our country. We have to end the sickness.\u201d Robert Unanue, the president of Goya Foods, the largest Latino-owned food company in the US, and a longtime vocal cheerleader of the former president and his lies that the 2020 election was stolen, stepped up to take the microphone and deliver a lengthy speech praising Trump. \u201cI can\u2019t believe your courage, your fight, and I know why you\u2019re doing this. You\u2019re not doing it for anything, but because you love this country. You love us, and we love you,\u201d he said. Unanue was not the only Latino business figure heaping praise. Joel Garza, owner of multiple Sonic fast-food franchises and another veteran of the Trump podium, said the former president needed to be re-elected to \u201chelp us with banks [and] stop regulations\u201d. The ultimate adulation, however, came at the conclusion of the roundtable when a group of religious leaders stood around Trump, who was seated at the table, eyes closed, with their hands on his shoulders. \u201cWe lift up the man that we believe you\u2019ve put your hand upon to help restore America and bring America back to the place that honors you,\u201d Ramiro Pe\u00f1a, one of Trump\u2019s most influential Latino evangelists, said in a direct appeal to the heavens. The Honduran televangelist Guillermo Maldonado, founder of the Miami megachurch the King Jesus International Ministry, closed out the event with a prediction Trump would defeat Harris because \u201cthere\u2019s a higher assignment for him to finish with this nation\u201d. \u201cThis is a war between good and evil,\u201d he insisted. \u201cGod sets up kings. He removes kings. We\u2019re going to pray for the will of God to make [Trump] the 47th president.\u201d Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "A speech by Australian judge Patrick Keane KC has been met by a vociferous protest over his continued presence on the bench of Hong Kong\u2019s controversial court of final appeal. A slew of foreign judges has quit the court, with one arguing the rule of law in Hong Kong has been \u201cprofoundly compromised\u201d and that the city-state is \u201cbecoming a totalitarian state\u201d. Of the six remaining foreign judges \u2013 down from 15 \u2013 four are Australian. Only two, including Keane, joined the court since the implementation of Hong Kong\u2019s national security law, which criminalises acts of dissent and subversion, and is seen as a political weapon against the pro-democracy movement. Keane spoke at Sydney\u2019s Banco Court on Tuesday night, giving an address titled Christian Inspiration and Constitutional Insights that included quotes from such varied figures as Frederick the Great, Thomas Jefferson, John Locke and British judge Lord Jonathan Sumption, one of his former colleagues on the Hong Kong court bench. Sumption quit the bench in June this year, writing in an excoriating opinion piece that the rule of law in Hong Kong was \u201cprofoundly compromised\u201d, and that the territory was \u201cbecoming a totalitarian state\u201d. Sumption wrote that local judges were working under an \u201cimpossible political environment created by China\u201d. \u201cI remained on the [court] in the hope that the presence of overseas judges would help sustain the rule of law. I fear that this is no longer realistic,\u201d he wrote. On Tuesday evening, on the forecourt of Sydney\u2019s law courts building, protesters gathered bearing pictures of jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai, who is being held in solitary confinement on charges \u2013 internationally seen as politically motivated \u2013 of organising illegal protests. The Sydney protest seemingly prevented Keane from attending an advertised post-speech drinks. He had been due to attend but was not present. Alerted to the protest, he left the court building via an alternative exit, as protesters held a flashing neon representation of Lai in chains, above the words \u201cPrisoner of Conscience\u201d. One protester approached Keane in the street, filming him and asking: \u201cDo you know Jimmy Lai?\u201d Keane declined to comment. The Guardian has sent a series of questions to Keane. Keane, a justice of the Australian high court from 2013 until his retirement in 2022, has previously defended his position as a non-permanent judge on the Hong Kong bench. He told the Guardian in 2023 \u201cmy own view would be that given how successful the court [of final appeal] has been in its role in upholding the rule of law, one should be very slow indeed to decline the opportunity to serve on such a successful court\u201d. He said the court had a long history as \u201ca very successful institution that\u2019s made an important contribution to the success of Hong Kong\u201d, and that it was better to play a role rather than \u201cvacate the field\u201d. \u201cOne has to be very careful about declining to do good work because one has an apprehension that one might be asked to do bad work,\u201d he said. But pro-democracy activists and Hong Kong advocacy groups have consistently called for foreign judges to quit the CFA bench, arguing their judicial credibility lends legitimacy to a legal system which has been undermined by the city\u2019s worsening security environment, in particular the 2020 national security law. Critics say the court cannot claim to stand fully independent of government wishes, and that the government wishes are increasingly anti-democratic. The court of final appeal is Hong Kong\u2019s highest court, but on occasion the government has asked the Chinese central government \u2013 which has ultimate control of Hong Kong \u2013 to reinterpret laws after rulings it found unfavourable. In November 2022 the Hong Kong government did precisely that after the CFA rejected its attempt to have foreign lawyers banned from representing clients in national security cases. Government prosecutors had been seeking to ban British lawyer Tim Owen from representing Lai in court. In December, Beijing\u2019s top lawmaking body ruled that courts must get the Hong Kong leader\u2019s approval to admit any foreign lawyer on a national security case. Alyssa Fong, manager of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, said it was \u201cshocking\u201d that Keane had chosen to join the bench after the implementation of the national security law, which saw mass arrests of pro-democracy demonstrators, and widespread repression of civil liberties and press freedoms. \u201cAs a Hongkonger, it is heartbreaking,\u201d she said. Well-known figures from the international legal community sitting on the court lend legitimacy to the authoritarian crackdown in Hong Kong, she said. \u201cFollowing the string of resignations this summer, Justice Keane should reevaluate his position \u2026 and step down from the court of final appeal.\u201d Five foreign judges have resigned from the CFA this year, and 10 since the national security law was introduced. Several have cited the political situation in their reasons for leaving. There are now just six foreign judges left: four Australians including Keane, and two from the UK.

Justice Michael O\u2019Bryan said he would conduct the case management hearings for the two supermarkets together but each case would be heard separately. He said another case management hearing would be held at a date to be determined. The ACCC\u2019s fresh court documents contain details of 276 promotional items at Woolworths and 255 at Coles, which the regulator alleges supermarkets briefly increased prices on before advertising them as discounts. In one example, Woolworths sold Arnott\u2019s Tim Tams at $4.50 for 617 days, which the regulator refers to as its \u201cregular price\u201d. The price was increased to $6 for 21 days and then sold in a promotion for $5.50. While shoppers were told they were receiving a discount, the new price tag represented a 22% increase on the regular price, according to the regulator\u2019s analysis. Woolworths sold Maggi beef noodles in a discount promotion for 30% more than its regular price, according to the ACCC. Coles sold a range of L\u2019Or\u00e9al anti-wrinkle moisturisers for an extended period at $15 according to the court documents, but then increased the prices to $24 for a four-week period. The supermarket then allegedly put the skincare products in its discount promotions at $18, despite them being 20% more expensive than their regular price. A MasterFoods marinade stocked by Coles was sold in its promotion for 33% above its regulator price, the regulator alleges. The alleged consumer breaches cover almost all product categories, with snacks and pantry items, coffee, soft drinks, cosmetics and pet food all included in the ACCC\u2019s list of affected products.",

      "bodyText": "New South Wales government agencies have illegally charged people about $144m in merchant fees on an estimated 92m credit card transactions for services such as licence renewals, car registrations and fine repayments since 2016. The finance minister, Courtney Houssos, on Wednesday said the government had referred the issue to the NSW ombudsman for an investigation into \u201cpossible serious maladministration\u201d after the state auditor general alerted it to the issue in July. The state\u2019s corruption watchdog has also been informed. Houssos said the surcharges had been passed on to tens of millions of customers despite \u201crepeated legal advice\u201d during the former Coalition government\u2019s term that Revenue NSW and Service NSW could not lawfully charge merchant fees. \u201cI find these revelations extremely concerning, and I can\u2019t see how there is an excuse for a government [agency] that was repeatedly advised that activity was unlawful and to continue to do that,\u201d she said. She said that due to a longstanding practice of new governments not being given access to advice provided to previous governments, it was impossible at this stage to say who within the previous government was informed of the issue and when. According to the government, an average individual will have been affected by about $30, but for some, it could be more. Houssos and the customer services minister, Jihad Dib, would not commit to reimbursing residents, but said it was being looked at. The NSW treasury had directed the agencies to recover the cost of merchant fees in 2012, but the Crown Solicitor\u2019s Office between February 2016 and December 2022 advised that the payments were unlawful, a government statement said. The secretary of the Department of Customer Services, Graeme Head, has referred the matter to the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the statement said, \u201cnoting the apparent failure to act on the 2016 crown solicitor\u2019s advice\u201d. Dib said he was \u201cabsolutely flabbergasted\u201d when the revelations came to light and that there were \u201ca lot of people with questions to answer here\u201d. \u201cWhilst we\u2019re not pointing fingers, we just want to know very clearly\u2026. how did this happen, why did it happen and why did it continue?\u201d he said. Houssos said that although most government transactions took place through Service NSW, every department had been instructed to report to Treasury by 30 November on whether they charge merchant fees and if they have the legal authority to do so. A taskforce had stopped merchant fees being charged directly by Revenue NSW and the Rental Bond Board, and on more than 80% of Service NSW transactions. Dib said the goal was to turn off all payments in the next couple of weeks. The government said the fees had been switched off for more than 90% of online payments, including the top 12 Service NSW transactions, with the taskforce working to urgently stop any remaining surcharges. Former NSW finance minister Damien Tudehope on Wednesday said he was never informed of issues relating to merchant fees while he was serving as a minister in the then Coalition government. \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever receiving any advice that the passing on of merchant fees by Service NSW was illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not denying that it exists but I don\u2019t recall ever seeing any such advice. If I had \u2026 I would have raised it immediately.\u201d He called on the Minns government to refund affected residents urgently. The opposition leader, Mark Speakman, who served as the attorney general in the previous government, said he was first made aware of the issue on Wednesday morning. The opposition\u2019s customer service spokesperson, James Griffin, said he had attempted to contact the former minister in charge of Service NSW, Victor Dominello, but was yet to make contact at 11am on Wednesday. Typical surcharges on Service NSW transactions included 30 cents for a 1-year licence renewal, 29 cents for a marriage certificate and $1.92 to renew registration for a small car such as a Toyota Corolla, according to the government statement. The average surcharge on a Revenue NSW payment in 2023-24 was $0.92. People who have been charged fees are encouraged to register for updates on the government\u2019s response at www.service.nsw.gov.au or by calling Service NSW on 13 77 88.",

Here\u2019s more from the Journal-Constitution:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But with 8% of likely voters indicating they\u2019re still undecided, the race could break either way as early voting enters its second week.</p> <p>Among the most telling takeaways of the poll is the stability of the race. As both campaigns pour time and treasure into Georgia, Trump\u2019s support remains <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/politics/ajc-poll-finds-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-are-locked-in-a-tight-race-in-georgia/C5CQ6742V5AHVIDUVQ77LQ7YMY/\">virtually unchanged </a>since the AJC\u2019s last poll in September. Harris\u2019 dropped a fraction of a percentage point. The number of undecided voters has hardly budged.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really close race. Neither side has this in the bag,\u201d said University of Georgia political scientist Trey Hood, who oversaw the poll. \u201cAnd that makes the next two weeks even more important.\u201d</p> <p>The poll suggests that Harris may still be struggling to woo Black voters, the bulwark of the Democratic coalition. About three-quarters of Black voters say they\u2019ll vote for her, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/georgia\">far behind the 88% </a>that Joe Biden won in 2020 when he narrowly flipped Georgia.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean those voters are gravitating toward Trump. One in 5 Black voters are undecided, while only 8% say they will cast their ballot for Trump. It indicates that Harris\u2019 campaign, which has stepped up efforts to bolster her Black support, should be more worried about apathy than losing those voters to the GOP.</p> <p>In another sign of concern for Harris, 11% of Democrats say they\u2019re undecided. While few back third-party candidates \u2014 the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein and others registered minimal support \u2014 the poll suggests she has more work to do to consolidate her base and little time to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6717ef128f087dde7205e584\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-22T18:31:35.030Z\">7.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>CBS News reports that Republican former prosecutors have asked the justice department to investigate Elon Musk\u2019s effort to pay voters to cast ballots for Donald Trump:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MacFarlaneNews/status/1848711232573874240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEW:  Justice Dept confirms to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@cbsnews</a> that it has received inquiry from former federal  prosecutors and GOP appointees to \u201crequest that (Justice Dept) review payments that are being made by the Elon Musk-founded America PAC to voters in Pennsylvania and other states that\u2026</p>&mdash; Scott MacFarlane (@MacFarlaneNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacFarlaneNews/status/1848711232573874240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 22, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MacFarlaneNews/status/1848714427551338765\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Justice Dept confirms receipt of the letter... but declines to comment further <br><br>The former GOP-appointed officials want a DOJ review of Musk&#39;s effort</p>&mdash; Scott MacFarlane (@MacFarlaneNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacFarlaneNews/status/1848714427551338765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 22, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <p>Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic governor <strong>Josh Shapiro</strong> made a similar suggestion over the weekend:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/election-shapiro-musk-1-million-giveaway\">Pennsylvania governor says law enforcement should investigate Elon Musk\u2019s $1m voter ploy</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6717ea5a8f08deab319f3b88\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-22T18:11:26.761Z\">7.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Donald Trump\u2019s freewheeling, stream-of-consciousness style of delivering speeches doesn\u2019t always hit the mark.

Here are some key events and stories from the day: Barack Obama and Tim Walz baited the Trump campaign at a Wisconsin rally as part of an early voting push. Kamala Harris told NBC that she has no doubt that the US was ready for a female president, insisting that Americans care more about what candidates can do to help them, rather than their gender. Trump\u2019s campaign has filed an extraordinary complaint against the UK\u2019s Labour party for what it claims is \u201cinterference\u201d in the US presidential election. The US army has been ordered to release documents about the Trump campaign\u2019s pugnacious visit to Arlington national cemetery. Scrutiny is growing about the Montana aerial firefighting company once led by Tim Sheehy, the former Navy Seal and Republican Senate candidate who could oust the Democrat incumbent Jon Tester. Arab Americans are slightly more likely to vote for Donald Trump than Kamala Harris, according to a new poll, in a worrying sign for the Democratic nominee\u2019s chances of carrying the battleground state of Michigan. Michigan\u2019s top elections official defended the state\u2019s elections after repeated attacks on Twitter/X from Elon Musk, who spread false claims about inactive voters. Trump\u2019s former chief of staff said the Republican candidate meets the definition of a \u201cfascist\u201d and reiterated that Trump previously praised Hitler. In an interview with Telemundo earlier today, Kamala Harris pledged to drive more funds to community banks to help Latino men access small business loans. \u201cWe need to construct a strong economy that supports the working class, the vice-president said, AP reported. She continued: I know that Hispanic men often have more difficulty securing loans from banks because of their connections and the fact that things aren\u2019t necessarily set up so that they will qualify \u2026 For that reason, I\u2019m focused on seeing what we can do to bring more capital to community banks that better understand the community so we can give them that kind of loans. In a Trump event in Florida courting Latino voters, the former president denigrated Harris as \u201clazy as hell\u201d and \u201clow IQ\u201d. Barack Obama is rallying in Detroit after he was introduced by Eminem. The former president mocked Trump for his meandering rallies and inability to coherently answer questions: Have you seen Mr Trump lately? \u2026 He\u2019ll give two-and-a-half-hour speeches, just a word salad, you don\u2019t know what the heck he\u2019s saying. The other day he had a town hall meeting .. about 45 minutes into it, he says: \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t feel like taking questions no more,\u2019 and then he just played music for half an hour. Praising Kamala Harris, Obama took another swipe at Trump for his publicity stunt at a McDonald\u2019s: This is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice, need a champion \u2013 somebody who was raised in the middle class. She worked at McDonald\u2019s when she was in college to pay her expenses. She did not pretend to work at McDonald\u2019s when it was closed. Kamala Harris said that she has no doubt the US is ready for a female president, insisting that Americans care more about what candidates can do to help them, rather than a presidential contender\u2019s gender. The vice-president\u2019s statement came during an interview with NBC News\u2019s Hallie Jackson, who asked whether she thought the country was ready for a woman, and a woman of color, to be in the Oval Office. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cIn terms of every walk of life of our country,\u201d Harris said, \u201cpart of what is important in this election is really, not really turning the page \u2013 closing a chapter, on an era that suggests that Americans are divided. Rapper Eminem took the stage at the Detroit rally for Kamala Harris: It\u2019s important to use your voice, so I\u2019m encouraging everybody to get out and vote, please \u2026 I also think that people shouldn\u2019t be afraid to express their opinions, and I don\u2019t think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution \u2026 if you make your opinion known. Vice-President Harris supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld. Eminem then introduced Barack Obama, who started his speech by reciting Eminem lyrics. John Kelly, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, told the New York Times that he believes his former boss meets the definition of \u201cfascist\u201d. Kelly, a retired Marine general who was Trump\u2019s longest-serving chief of staff, has publicly condemned the former president over his contempt for wounded and killed soldiers. In a new interview with the Times, Kelly was asked whether he considered Trump a fascist. Kelly responded: Looking at the definition of fascism: It\u2019s a far-right authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy \u2026 Certainly, in my experience, those are the kinds of things that he thinks would work better in terms of running America. Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he\u2019s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators \u2013 he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure. Kelly said Trump \u201cprefers the dictator approach to government\u201d. Kelly also confirmed past reports that Trump privately made admiring comments about Hitler: \u201cHe commented more than once that, \u2018You know, Hitler did some good things, too.\u2019\u201d Donald Trump is now speaking at a rally in North Carolina, mocking Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Tim Walz and other Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re close to a nuclear war, and we don\u2019t know who the hell is running our country,\u201d the former president said, before an audience member shouted: \u201cObama!\u201d Trump continued: \u201cObama, that\u2019s another beauty. Obama, he did great, didn\u2019t he? He did great, if you like a divided country. He was a great, he was fabulous. Obama, he was a real beauty. But under the Trump administration, we\u2019re going to take back what is ours.\u201d Speaking at a Democratic campaign office in New Hampshire, Joe Biden outlined the threat posed by a second Donald Trump term: \u201cHe is talking about doing away with the entire Department of Education. He means it, this is not a joke. This is a guy who also wants to replace every civil servant, every single one, [who] thinks he has a version of the supreme court ruling on immunity to be able ... to actually eliminate, physically eliminate, shoot, kill someone who is, he believes, to be the threat to him. I know this sounds bizarre. It sounds like, if I said this five years ago, you\u2019d lock me up. We got to lock him up \u2013 politically lock him up.\u201d The president paused after he echoed the \u201clock him up\u201d chants of Trump critics, and then added \u201cpolitically\u201d. When Kamala Harris supporters have shouted \u201clock him up\u201d, she has generally not encouraged the chants and said the courts will handle his criminal cases. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing about that. The courts are going to take care of that,\u201d the vice-president recently said at a rally. Trump has falsely claimed that Biden was behind his prosecution and conviction in his New York hush-money case and has repeatedly blamed Democrats for his various criminal cases. In her NBC interview, Hallie Jackson asked Kamala Harris whether she would consider pardoning Donald Trump if she were elected, citing the argument some have made that clemency would \u201chelp unify the country and move on\u201d. The vice-president responded: I\u2019m not going to get into those hypotheticals, I\u2019m focused on the next 14 days \u2026 Let me tell you what\u2019s gonna help us move on: I get elected president of the United States. Harris also said the Democrats \u201chave the resources and the expertise\u201d in the case of Trump trying to subvert the election or declare early victory. She added: This is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo the free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people, who incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol, and some 140 law enforcement officers were attacked. Some were killed. This is a very serious matter. Asked about Elon Musk\u2019s pledge to give away $1m to random voters as he campaigns for Trump, Harris said: I\u2019m not about doing gimmicks and all of that. I think that what we have to do, and what I\u2019m going to continue to do, is to be out in the communities. Two weeks out from election day, JD Vance told supporters at a rally in swing state Arizona that they need to pull their friends to the polls because the race could go either way. \u201cHere\u2019s the scenario that I want you to consider, and I don\u2019t mean to give you nightmare fuel here, but I\u2019m going to do it,\u201d Vance said to the crowd in Peoria, Arizona. \u201cWe wake up on November the sixth, and Kamala Harris is barely elected president of the United States by a 700-vote margin in the state of Arizona. Think about that. And ask yourself what you can do from now until then to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Vance visited Arizona on Tuesday, stopping in Peoria, part of the suburban metro around Phoenix, and is scheduled to stop in Tucson, in southern Arizona, later in the day. Donald Trump plans to rally in the state on Thursday. Democrats have a host of campaign surrogates, including former president Bill Clinton and current president Joe Biden, on the schedule this week in the final stretch before 5 November . Kamala Harris has done an interview with NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson, as part of her ongoing media blitz. The interview is airing in full at 6.30 ET, but here are some initial highlights. Jackson asked which concessions could be on the table on reproductive rights, such as religious exemptions. Harris responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be making concessions when we\u2019re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body.\u201d She declined to entertain hypotheticals about possible compromises with Republicans, saying: \u201cA basic freedom has been taken from the women of America, the freedom to make decisions about their own body. And that cannot be negotiable.\u201d Harris also said she is not concerned with sexism impacting the race: My challenge is the challenge of making sure I can talk with and listen to as many voters as possible and earn their vote. And I will never assume that anyone in our country should elect a leader based on their gender or their race, instead that that leader needs to earn the vote based on substance. Asked if the \u201ccountry is ready for a woman and a woman of color to be president\u201d, Harris responded: \u201cAbsolutely \u2026 Part of what is important in this election is really not only turning the page, but closing the page and the chapter on an era that suggests that Americans are divided.\u201d Scrutiny is growing about the Montana aerial firefighting company once led by Tim Sheehy, the former Navy Seal and Republican Senate candidate who could oust the Democrat incumbent Jon Tester in next month\u2019s election. According to NBC News, Sheehy\u2019s Bridger Aerospace, a company he founded in 2013, negotiated a deal with Gallatin county in eastern Montana to use its pristine credit rating to raise $160m in bonds. The county was meant to benefit from Bridger\u2019s plans to hire more workers and build two new aircraft hangers. But the company used most of the money, or $134m, from the 2022 bond issue to pay back previous investment from Blackstone, a New York-based investment giant. Bridger\u2019s finances have been complicated by the fact that there were fewer wildfires to fight this year and thus less revenue for Bridger. As of Tuesday, the National Interagency Fire Center reported 42,603 wildfires nationwide this year compared with the 10-year average of 48,689 for the same period. In financial filings for the quarterly period that ended 30 June 2024, Bridger said it had \u201ca substantial amount of debt\u201d and that failure to service that debt \u201ccould prolong the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. A victory for Sheehy in November could hand Republicans control of the Senate, making his connections to Bridger a vital topic as voters head to the polls. Election day is exactly two weeks away, and today has been a frenzy of campaign activity. Eminem reportedly will introduce Barack Obama when he appears in Detroit tonight, and Bruce Springsteen will headline two concerts as part of a series that will hit every swing state. Obama also campaigned with Tim Walz in Wisconsin. JD Vance dodged a question about whether he would strip immigrants with legal authorization of their status, at an event in Arizona. Donald Trump will be in North Carolina, where Walz is holding a second event this evening. Trump held a roundtable with Latino leaders but took his time in getting to issues of importance to the voting bloc. Harris will campaign in Houston on Friday, with an eye towards picking up Texas\u2019s Senate seat and highlighting how abortion bans have affected women in the Republican bastion. The US economy is poised for stronger growth than many wealthy nations, the International Monetary Fund said in forecasts released today. Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Joe Biden appeared alongside Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to discuss his administration\u2019s work on lowering prescription drug prices. But the president also took a chance to issue a warning that Trump and Vance were extreme. \u201cThis is not your father\u2019s Republican party,\u201d Biden said, referencing Strom Thurmond, the late senator from South Carolina who famously conducted the longest speaking filibuster in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Thurmond later moderated his stance. \u201cPeople change, but these guys just keep getting worse,\u201d Biden said of the party now. \u201cGet to the vote. Because the nation\u2019s democracy depends on it.\u201d He shared an embrace with Sanders. At an early voting pop-up location at the University of Minnesota, hundreds of students waited in line to cast ballots on Tuesday \u2013 a sign of youth enthusiasm for the presidential election. The early voting location at the campus\u2019 Weisman Art Museum, a one-day on-campus polling place for any Minneapolis voter, was a first-time occasion made possible by recent changes in state law to allow for pop-up polling places to help voters who can be harder to reach, like college students. \u201cWe brought the polls to them,\u201d said Riley Hetland, a sophomore and undergraduate student government civic engagement director who helped plan the event. Hetland said the group has been going to classrooms and hosting tables around campus for weeks to get people registered to vote and help them make a plan to cast ballots. So far, they have gotten 12,000 voters to pledge to vote, double their goal of 6,000. Madelyn Ekstrand finished her class for the day and waited about an hour, all told, to cast her ballot. The 21-year-old senior said abortion access and climate change were important to her, so she was voting for Harris. She thought she\u2019d vote early to get it done, but didn\u2019t realize how popular the choice would be \u2013 she was glad it was so busy. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see people my age getting out and voting and being proactive and not waiting till the last second,\u201d she said. The ruling upholds another order by a Fulton county judge, who invalidated last-minute rules made by Georgia\u2019s state election board this year. The rules, which were approved by Trump-aligned members of the board, would have required all ballots to be counted by hand on election night \u2013 a feat that would probably yield results that are far less accurate than a count done by ballot scanners. The changes would also have allowed officials investigate discrepancies in vote totals and conduct \u201creasonable inquiries\u201d into irregularities, without clarifying what such an inquiry entailed. The unanimous ruling by the conservative-majority supreme court did not touch on the legality of the seven rules \u2013 rather, it dismissed a request to hold a decision issued by a lower-court judge. It\u2019s an arresting split screen: Barack Obama, in Madison, tells voters that when Trump and Vance are pressed to elaborate on their policies, \u201cthey\u2019ll fall back on one answer: blame immigrants\u201d. \u201cHe wants you to believe that if you let him round up whoever he wants and ships them out, all your problems will be solved,\u201d Obama says. Meanwhile, in Arizona, JD Vance dodges a question about whether he would strip immigrants of their legal status. Barack Obama is hitting on a key issue for voters: the economy. \u201cDon\u2019t have nostalgia for what his economy was. Because it was mine,\u201d Obama said. Polls show voters tend to favor Trump on the economy, yearning for the time, early in Trump\u2019s presidency, pre-pandemic, when housing and grocery costs were lower. \u201cI spent eight years cleaning up the mess that Republicans left,\u201d Obama said. Tim Walz has wrapped up his speech, after introducing Barack Obama. The Democratic former president apologized for being late, saying he had an issue with his plane that forced him to drive to Madison from Chicago. \u201cSo we board the plane \u2026 and then the pilot comes in and says: \u2018Sir, there\u2019s a pile of oil leaking out of the back of the plane.\u2019 Now, I do not know anything about planes, except for the fact that it should not leak oil. So we had a nice road trip instead, and I am glad I made it,\u201d Obama said. Tim Walz encouraged the crowd not to grow sanguine about the possibility of a second Trump term, saying the Republican could retaliate against him if he returns to the White House. \u201cHere\u2019s another reason that the stakes are so high in this election, something that I don\u2019t think many of us have seen. You hear some version of this from the people in your life, neighbors, relatives, brothers, in some cases, who said, look, we made it through the first Trump term, we\u2019ll get through a second. This Donald Trump \u2026 is far more dangerous \u2026 He is not the 2016 Donald Trump. This is a brand-new version,\u201d Walz said. He elaborated on why he believes that: As Kamala says, he is a very unserious person, but the consequences of putting him back in office are deadly serious. He\u2019s talking about sending the military against people who don\u2019t support him. He\u2019s naming names. Look, I recognize I\u2019m going to be at the top of that list. You think he\u2019s stopping with me? He\u2019s talking about you. He\u2019s talking about using the United States military to go after people who disagree with his idiotic ideas, his unpatriotic ideas, his traitorous ideas. And he\u2019s talking about using the military. He talks about the enemy from within. After Donald Trump recently called Kamala Harris a \u201cshit vice-president\u201d, Tim Walz just used similar language to describe Elon Musk\u2019s enthusiastic campaigning for the former president. Musk bounded on stage and briefly got airborne at a Trump rally in the Pennsylvania town where the former president nearly lost his life in an assassination attempt in July. Here\u2019s what Walz had to say about that: So look, Elon is on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dipshit on these things. You know it. Think about it \u2026 that guy is literally the richest man in the world spending millions of dollars to help Donald Trump buy an election. Now, look, they\u2019re saying the quiet parts out loud now, because Donald Trump has already promised that he would put Elon in charge of government regulations that oversee the businesses that Elon runs. That\u2019s a hell of a buy. He could spend billions to make more than $10bn on the back end. So in other words, Donald Trump, in front of the eyes of the American public, is promising corruption. That\u2019s what he\u2019s promising you. And you know what? I don\u2019t believe, I don\u2019t believe he keeps many promises, but he\u2019ll keep that one. Tim Walz then took Donald Trump to task for the staged campaign event he held at a Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s over the weekend, saying the appearance amounted to a \u201cstunt\u201d. \u201cHe went to a McDonald\u2019s and dressed up as the drive-thru worker. They found him an apron his size and put it on him. And I was thinking, it is possible he mixed up his weekends and thought that it was Halloween already. He\u2019s been forgetting things lately, as you might have noticed,\u201d Walz said. Pressing the attack, the Minnesota governor continued: That restaurant, that restaurant wasn\u2019t even open. It was a stunt \u2013 fake orders for fake customers. They even staged the drive thru. We know that they won\u2019t let you walk through the damn drive thru. We knew that. They saw that happening. But look, everything about this guy is fake. Everything he does is fake. Next, he\u2019s going to be telling you he\u2019s a cop or a construction worker because he dances to the Village People, so he knows the YMCA. And I\u2019ll tell you this: so that five minutes he stood next to the deep fryer, I\u2019ll guarantee you that\u2019s the hardest that guy\u2019s ever worked in his life. And that\u2019s not a joke. Tim Walz laid into Donald Trump for the meandering tone of his recent speeches and for declining to debate Kamala Harris for a second time. \u201cIt takes stamina to run for president. It takes stamina to be president, and Donald Trump does not have stamina,\u201d Walz began. \u201cHe has been rambling more than the normal rambling.\u201d Noting that Trump has lately taken to describing his speaking style as \u201cthe weave\u201d, Walz said: \u201cWe know there\u2019s only one weave that you know anything about, and it is not this. It is not this \u2026 He\u2019s ducks debates, but you can\u2019t blame him. When you get your ass whipped that hard, you don\u2019t come back for seconds.\u201d After the customary playing of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Freedom \u2013 the song used at just about every Harris campaign event \u2013 Tim Walz strolled on stage. He shouted out all the Democrats who introduced him, as well as the rally attendees: \u201cBut each of you, huge thank-you. Took time out of your busy lives, you came here, you came here because you believe in the promise of America and you believe in the democracy. Thank you.\u201d Next up was Tammy Baldwin, the state Democratic senator who is locked in an increasingly tight re-election battle against Republican Eric Hovde. Like Tony Evers before her on the lineup, Baldwin centered her appeal to voters on her support for abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act. \u201cJust a little bragging here: I wrote the provision in the Affordable Care Act that allows young people to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance until they turn 26 and I will never stop fighting until all Americans have the quality, affordable healthcare that they need and deserve,\u201d she said. Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, one of the early speakers at the Walz-Obama rally in Madison, didn\u2019t hold back when describing what a second Donald Trump presidency would mean. \u201cWe know Trump and Vance will try to pass a national abortion ban, roll back access to birth control, emergency contraception and even fertility treatments. We know that they\u2019re going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and deny coverage to folks like me and so many others here in the audience, and people you care about who have a pre-existing condition,\u201d he said. The governor continued: What Trump said about that \u2013 he\u2019s got the concept of a plan. Now you take that concept for a plan and go pay a bill, it ain\u2019t going to work. And they\u2019re going to give more tax breaks for the ultra-rich and the big corporations instead of helping working families get ahead. And we know that a second Trump term would mean unchecked power with no guardrails to hold them back. That\u2019s just bullshit. Actor Bradley Whitford \u2013 you may remember him from The West Wing or the many movies and television shows he\u2019s appeared in since that series concluded \u2013 is giving a lengthy introduction for Tim Walz and Barack Obama in his home town Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cMake sure five people who you may assume are with you, make sure they make a plan and make sure they vote,\u201d Whitford told the crowd. \u201cBecause I got news for you. If we spend the next two weeks knocking doors, manning phones, doing everything we can to get out every vote, with your help, we\u2019re gonna win. We\u2019re not, we\u2019re not, we\u2019re not moving back, we\u2019re not going back, we\u2019re moving forward. We\u2019re gonna win with your help. We\u2019re gonna hold this country up.\u201d Tim Walz is soon to take the stage along with Barack Obama in Madison, Wisconsin. It\u2019s the only joint appearance the two men will make today, though Obama will head to Detroit this evening, while Walz will hold a second event in Racine, Wisconsin. The rally comes as Obama steps up his campaigning for Kamala Harris, with the general election two weeks away. The vice-president is meanwhile in Washington DC, where she has taped interviews with NBC News and Noticias Telemundo that will air in the evening. We\u2019ll let you know what Walz and Obama have to say. Donald Trump has a small lead among likely voters in Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports in a new poll. He leads Kamala Harris with 47% support to the vice-president\u2019s 43%, just outside the survey\u2019s 3.1 percentage point margin of error. However, all signs point to a race that remains either candidate\u2019s to win. Here\u2019s more from the Journal-Constitution: But with 8% of likely voters indicating they\u2019re still undecided, the race could break either way as early voting enters its second week. Among the most telling takeaways of the poll is the stability of the race. As both campaigns pour time and treasure into Georgia, Trump\u2019s support remains virtually unchanged since the AJC\u2019s last poll in September. Harris\u2019 dropped a fraction of a percentage point. The number of undecided voters has hardly budged. \u201cIt\u2019s a really close race. Neither side has this in the bag,\u201d said University of Georgia political scientist Trey Hood, who oversaw the poll. \u201cAnd that makes the next two weeks even more important.\u201d The poll suggests that Harris may still be struggling to woo Black voters, the bulwark of the Democratic coalition. About three-quarters of Black voters say they\u2019ll vote for her, far behind the 88% that Joe Biden won in 2020 when he narrowly flipped Georgia. That doesn\u2019t mean those voters are gravitating toward Trump. One in 5 Black voters are undecided, while only 8% say they will cast their ballot for Trump. It indicates that Harris\u2019 campaign, which has stepped up efforts to bolster her Black support, should be more worried about apathy than losing those voters to the GOP. In another sign of concern for Harris, 11% of Democrats say they\u2019re undecided. While few back third-party candidates \u2014 the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein and others registered minimal support \u2014 the poll suggests she has more work to do to consolidate her base and little time to do so. CBS News reports that Republican former prosecutors have asked the justice department to investigate Elon Musk\u2019s effort to pay voters to cast ballots for Donald Trump: Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic governor Josh Shapiro made a similar suggestion over the weekend: Donald Trump\u2019s freewheeling, stream-of-consciousness style of delivering speeches doesn\u2019t always hit the mark. The latest example is the daughter of golf legend Arnold Palmer, who did not like the way the former president talked about her late father\u2019s penis, the Guardian\u2019s Ramon Antonio Vargas reports: Arnold Palmer\u2019s daughter says Donald Trump disrespected her late father\u2019s memory by fawning over the size of the champion golfer\u2019s penis at a campaign rally over the weekend. \u201cHackneyed anecdotes from the locker room \u2026 seemed disrespectful and inappropriate to me,\u201d Peg Palmer Wears told ABC News on Monday, two days after the former president publicly suggested her father was well endowed. Wears added that \u201cpeople coming to these rallies\u201d hosted by Trump as he seeks a second presidency \u201cdeserve substance about plans [he] has as a candidate\u201d. She specifically called on him to address \u201csome of the threats he\u2019s made to people\u201d, an apparent reference to how he recently suggested sending the US military against his political adversaries when voters go to the polls during the 5 November presidential election. \u201cThese are important issues that should be discussed for people when they\u2019re getting ready to vote, and using my dad to cover over the important things just seems unacceptable to me,\u201d Wears said. Trump was speaking to his supporters in Palmer\u2019s home town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Saturday at a regional airport named after him when the former president suddenly invoked the genitals of the renowned golfer, an old acquaintance. \u201cArnold Palmer was all man,\u201d Trump remarked. \u201cWhen he took showers with other pros, they came out of there \u2013 they said, \u2018Oh my God. That\u2019s unbelievable.\u2019\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic representative from New York, did not hold back in criticizing Trump\u2019s minutes-long stint as a fry cook at a Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s on Sunday, saying he was \u201cmaking fun\u201d of workers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Donald Trump putting on a little McDonald\u2019s costume because he thinks that\u2019s what people do,\u201d she said Monday at a United Auto Workers event, per the Hill. \u201cThey\u2019re not trying to empathize with us. They are making fun of us. \u201cDonald Trump thinks that people who work at McDonald\u2019s are a joke.\u201d Trump stopped by the fast-food restaurant for a staged campaign event where employees showed him how to make fries. He then served pre-approved customers at the drive-through window. Trump used the event to needle Kamala Harris, whom he has claimed lied about her time working at McDonald\u2019s during college. Trump has made these claims without providing any evidence whatsoever. Top Senate Democrats released a report today urging voters to cast their ballots as early as possible. The document also sought to answer questions about the election process. The lawmakers \u2013 which include New York Senator Chuck Schumer, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar \u2013 reminded voters that the outcome might not be known on 5 November as different states have varying timelines for accepting and processing mail-in ballots. Their document also emphasizes that voter intimidation, as well as violence, \u201cis never acceptable and any attempts to suppress the vote will not be tolerated\u201d. The report notes that under federal law, \u201cit is illegal to intimidate, threaten, or coerce anyone in order to interfere with their right to vote\u201d. \u201cIn our democracy, every eligible citizen should be able to freely cast a ballot in the way that works best for them and should not face restrictions or barriers to voting,\u201d the report says. The document also appears to try addressing voters\u2019 concerns about whether votes were safe from interference, noting that officials from both political parties have \u201cconfirmed the security of recent elections\u201d and that the infrastructure \u201chas never been more secure\u201d. These statements come as Donald Trump, who still makes the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, has said that election fraud is unfolding in this race. (There is no evidence of massive voter fraud, including alleged irregularities surrounding mail-in ballots or non-citizens casting votes.) \u201cThere have been efforts to stoke fear and chaos about the election with false allegations of voter fraud,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe American people should beware of election misinformation.\u201d Election day is exactly two weeks away. Gulp. While there\u2019s no telling who is going to win, NBC News and CNN reported this morning that Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign is bracing for a very close election that could potentially see the \u201cblue wall\u201d swing states not vote as a bloc for the first time in decades. They are deploying a variety of surrogates on the campaign trail to make the case for the vice-president in the final two weeks, with Eminem reportedly set to introduce Barack Obama when he appears in Detroit tonight, and Bruce Springsteen to headline two concerts as part of a series that will hit every swing state. Obama will also campaign with Tim Walz in Wisconsin later today, JD Vance will hold two events in Arizona, Donald Trump will campaign in North Carolina, and Walz will hold a second event in the Badger state before the evening is through. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Trump held a round table with Latino leaders but took his time in getting to issues of importance to the voting bloc. Harris will campaign in Houston on Friday, with an eye towards picking up Texas\u2019s Senate seat and highlighting how abortion bans have affected women in the Republican bastion. The US economy is poised for stronger growth than many wealthy nations, the IMF said in forecasts released today. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign will hold concerts in the seven swing states, with legendary performer Bruce Springsteen to appear alongside the vice-president and Barack Obama on Thursday in Georgia, a senior campaign official said. The Atlanta concert is the first of what the campaign is calling the When We Vote We Win series, and is aimed at whipping up voter enthusiasm ahead of 5 November. It will continue on Monday of next week in Philadelphia, when Springsteen and Obama will appear together, and concerts in the five other swing states will be announced soon, the official said. Springsteen has backed Democrats before, and endorsed Harris earlier this month: Donald Trump\u2019s round table with Latino leaders in Doral, Miami, has just concluded. The audience livened a little as the former president turned his attention, briefly, to immigration. He repeated baseless and often-aired claims that foreign countries, especially Venezuela, were opening their prisons to send \u201cviolent gang members\u201d and drug dealers into the US with military weapons. He called Kamala Harris \u201ca stupid person\u201d as he falsely labeled her Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cborder tsar\u201d. His remarks segued quickly into an attack on Democrats for allegedly allowing transgender women to play women\u2019s sports and a somewhat fanciful tale of a \u201ca man who transitioned into, congratulations, a woman\u201d smashing a baseball so hard it hit a female player on the head and \u201cthese young ladies said they\u2019d never seen anything like it\u201d. Perhaps sensing things were going off topic, event host Jennifer Korn, a former White House aide and executive director of the Hispanic Leadership Network, attempted to interrupt with a \u201cMr President \u2026 \u201d \u201cI\u2019ll leave it at that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDoes anyone else have anything to say?\u201d Robert Unanue, the president of Goya Foods, the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the US, took the microphone for a lengthy speech praising Trump, then the event wound down with a prayer session. Honduran televangelist Guillermo Maltonado, founder of Miami megachurch the King Jesus International Ministry, said Trump would be re-elected because \u201cthere\u2019s a higher assignment for him to finish with this nation\u201d: God sets up kings. We\u2019re praying for the will of God to make [Trump] the 47th president. \u2022 This post was amended on 23 October 2024; an earlier version said \u201ctransgender men\u201d instead of transgender women. Detroit\u2019s own Eminem will introduce Barack Obama during his rally in support of Kamala Harris this evening in Michigan\u2019s largest city, and likely weigh in on the presidential election, CNN reports. It\u2019s a rare public appearance by the rapper who has been synonymous with the Motor City throughout his career, and who has occasionally condemned Harris\u2019s opponent, Donald Trump. The vice-president is not scheduled to attend the event, which begins at 7.45pm and is one of two appearances Obama is making for her campaign today. The former president is also rallying with Tim Walz in Madison, Wisconsin, at 2.30pm. Donald Trump hasn\u2019t yet turned his attention to issues affecting Latino voters at his round table in Miami. Instead he\u2019s on a tear about the Biden administration\u2019s policies that encourage the use of electric vehicles: They want to go to all-electric cars. A charging station is the equivalent of a gas pump \u2026 They spent $8b for nine charging stations. It\u2019s so out of control. They don\u2019t want to change. He was referring to a slow-moving $7.5bn federal program that by May had yielded a small number of charging stations, but has ramped since with more than 1,000 new installations nationwide each week, according to government figures. Trump is promising that if he is re-elected US businesses would continue to benefit from tax cuts he enacted in his first term: We gave you the biggest cut in taxes in the history of the country. We have a great foundation to build on a lot of companies coming in very fast. At one point Trump confused Kamala Harris, the vice-president and his Democratic opponent, with Hillary Clinton, whom he beat in 2016, calling the nonexistent Biden-Clinton administration \u201cthe worst ever\u201d. Donald Trump is telling a roundtable of Latino leaders at his golf resort in Doral, Florida, that he expects Hispanic voters to help sweep him to victory on 5 November. He claimed falsely that \u201call the polls\u201d show him ahead among Hispanic voters in swing states, despite surveys showing exactly the opposite. He kicked off the event by addressing the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, where he was campaigning yesterday. It was a \u201chorrible event\u201d he said, repeating debunked claims about the federal government\u2019s emergency response. \u201cFema responded not well, the White House has done a poor job. They should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d he said. Numerous politicians, including some prominent Republicans, have praised the speed at which federal resources and help reached the hardest-hit areas. Trump has yet to start answering questions, instead delivering a lengthy monologue with familiar attacks on Kamala Harris, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, whom he beat in 2016. It\u2019s the second time in a week that the former president has addressed Latino voters in Miami. In a town hall hosted by Univision, the largest US Spanish-language network, on Thursday, Trump mostly dodged awkward questions about immigration, and repeated debunked claims that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets and \u201cother things too that they\u2019re not supposed to\u201d. Meanwhile, senator Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign has hit out at Kamala Harris after it was announced she would visit Texas and appear alongside his opponent Colin Allred on Friday. \u201cColin Allred is Kamala Harris. They have spent the last four years working hand-in-hand against Texans and the American people with their radical policies, whether those be pushing to allow boys in girls\u2019 sports, allowing dangerous illegal aliens to come into our country or trying to destroy the oil and gas industry in Texas,\u201d a Cruz campaign spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cColin and Kamala share an agenda, and now they\u2019ll share a stage for all Texans to see.\u201d The first campaign event of the day is Donald Trump\u2019s round table with Latino leaders, which is scheduled to begin now at his golf resort in Doral, Florida. Latinos are a voting bloc whose support is expected to be crucial to deciding the election, both in swing states and in states and congressional districts that will determine which party controls the Senate and House of Representatives. Ahead of the event, Miami\u2019s Trump-supporting Republican mayor, Francis Suarez, told CNN in an interview that he does not believe the former president\u2019s vows to carry out mass deportations and impose draconian policies against undocumented migrants will hurt his support with Hispanic voters: Law-abiding Hispanics care more about having a prosperous future for themselves and their children than they do about people who are in this country illegally. And so I think there\u2019s a misperception that all they care about is, you know, immigration. And I think \u2026 that is, frankly, somewhat racist. You know, I think Hispanics care more about making sure that they have an opportunity to succeed, making sure that inflation doesn\u2019t crush them every single day as it\u2019s done under this administration. And they\u2019re law-abiding people, like my parents are, who came to this country at 12 and seven from \u2013 from Cuba, which is a communist country and has \u2013 and has only produced misery and poverty for its people. And they see a lot of the same rhetoric being, unfortunately, espoused by the Democratic party and that\u2019s something that concerns them. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign expects Donald Trump to put up a strong performance in the 5 November presidential election that could break apart the \u201cblue wall\u201d swing states for the first time in decades, according to two reports published this morning. While neither story suggests that the vice-president\u2019s campaign does not think it has a path to victory, the reports underscore the potency of Trump\u2019s bid for office and the fact that the race remains essentially tied despite weeks of vigorous campaigning and fundraising by Harris and her surrogates. Citing people with knowledge of Harris\u2019s campaign strategy, NBC News reports that they are concerned that the blue wall of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania could, for the first time since 1988, not vote as a bloc in November, imperiling the vice-president\u2019s path to the Oval Office. The campaign is also concerned that Hurricane Helene\u2019s ravages in North Carolina and the struggles of the controversial Republican candidates for governor are undermining Harris\u2019s chances of winning that state. Here\u2019s more: Recent discussions have centered on the possibility of an anomaly happening this year with just part of the blue wall breaking its way. The conversations have focused on whether Michigan or Wisconsin \u201cfall\u201d to former president Donald Trump while the two other states go blue, according to three sources with knowledge of the campaign\u2019s strategy. Losing Wisconsin or Michigan would mean that even if Harris secures Pennsylvania \u2013 where both Harris and Trump have spent the most time and resources \u2013 she would not reach the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the White House without winning another battleground state or possibly two. \u201cThere has been a thought that maybe Michigan or Wisconsin will fall off,\u201d said a senior Harris campaign official, who stressed that the bigger concern is over Michigan. Two other people with knowledge of campaign strategy \u2013 who, like others in this article, were granted anonymity to speak candidly \u2013 also underscored deep concern about Michigan. Those people still believe that all the states are close and that there are alternative routes to victory. A Harris campaign spokesperson pushed back against the notion about deep concerns over Michigan, pointing to recent public polling. A Detroit News poll conducted 1-4 October found Harris, who was campaigning in Michigan on Monday, holding a slight lead in the state, as did a Washington Post poll on Monday. \u2026 While North Carolina is still in the campaign\u2019s sights and Democrats maintain strong organization and leadership there, the Harris team is far less bullish about victory, four people with knowledge of the dynamics said. \u201cOf all of the seven [states], that one seems to be a little bit slipping away,\u201d the Harris campaign official said of North Carolina. CNN, meanwhile, heard from top Harris adviser David Plouffe, who acknowledged that the race may very well remain tight right down to election day: Historically, it would be unusual to have seven states come down to a point or less,\u201d David Plouffe, Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager who now serves as a senior adviser to Harris, said of the battleground landscape. \u201cBut I think at this point, you have to assume that\u2019s a distinct possibility.\u201d Plouffe and other Harris advisers do not believe Trump\u2019s largely outsourced door-knocking and other on-the-ground outreach operations can match what the national Democrats and the Harris campaign \u2013 which inherited some of the same team from President Joe Biden \u2013 spent a year putting together. But they believe this advantage can only take them so far. \u201cDemocrats wish Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t get more than 46% of the vote,\u201d Plouffe said, referring to the national popular vote percentage the former president secured in his previous campaigns. But in the battleground states, \u201cthat\u2019s not reality. He\u2019s going to get up to 48% in all of these states. And so we just have to make sure we\u2019re hitting our win number, which depending on the state, could be 50, could be 49.5.\u201d The Harris campaign just announced that the vice-president will campaign in Philadelphia on Sunday. The announcement was light on details, but needless to say it\u2019s difficult for Harris to win the White House without carrying Pennsylvania, and many Democratic voters live in and around Philadelphia. Kamala Harris will return to Texas in the final days of the presidential campaign for an event that will highlight the stories of women harmed by the state\u2019s strict abortion ban. In Houston on Friday, she will appear alongside the Democratic nominee for Senate, Colin Allred, who is locked in an unexpectedly tight race with the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz. Democrats have turned their attention to the Texas Senate race, despite a long history of falling short in the Republican-dominated state. With Democrats poised to lose a seat in West Virginia and Montana appearing to slip away, their best opportunity to keep control of the Senate may run through the Lone Star state. According to a senior campaign official, Harris will travel to Texas from Georgia, two states with the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The Democrat has repeatedly assailed Donald Trump for appointing the three supreme court justices who voted to overturn Roe v Wade and paved the way for a wave of new restrictions and near-total bans in Republican-led states. Harris has made abortion rights the centerpiece of her short campaign for the White House. At campaign stops, and the party\u2019s convention, she has shared the stories of women and families affected by abortion bans, among them Texas resident Amanda Zurawski, who nearly died after being denied an abortion under the state\u2019s law. Zurawski, along with the family of Amber Thurman, a Georgia woman who died after her medical care was delayed under the state\u2019s abortion law, have become powerful surrogates for Harris\u2019s campaign. Abortion has been a central issue in the Texas Senate race. Allred has made Cruz\u2019s staunch anti-abortion views a central plank of his campaign. Polls show Cruz with a steady lead, though the race has appeared to tighten in recent weeks. While in Houston, Harris will also sit for an interview with academic turned Ted talks host and popular podcaster Bren\u00e9 Brown. On the campaign trail, you\u2019ll hear Donald Trump assail the state of the economy and say Kamala Harris is to blame. And you\u2019ll hear Harris vow to lower prices for everything from housing to healthcare. There is no doubt that Americans have suffered from the wave of inflation that racked the country over the past three years, but has recently subsided. What\u2019s less discussed is that the US economy is, in fact, far healthier than many others. Just-released forecasts from the IMF, the Washington-based crisis lender whose economic data is closely watched from Wall Street to the White House, shows that the US economy is poised for some of the strongest growth among wealthy nations in the years to come, beating out the United Kingdom, Japan and many European nations: These are, of course, just projections, and as the Guardian\u2019s Larry Elliott reports, various things could undercut them \u2013 including some of the policies Trump is campaigning on: The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino earlier this month took the political pulse of young voters nationwide, particularly when it came to the question of which presidential candidate to support. Here\u2019s what she found: It was the height of \u201cbrat summer\u201d. Kamala Harris was a \u201cfemininomenon\u201d, electrifying a high-stakes presidential race that many of the country\u2019s youngest voters had been dreading: a rematch between the two oldest candidates in American history. Chartreuse-blocked memes and coconut emojis filled social media feeds. The tidal wave of young \u201cKamalove\u201d sparked a rush of small-dollar donations and volunteer sign-ups for her days-old campaign. For an extremely online generation of young Democrats, the vibes were so good. On the ground in St Louis, a cadre of young progressives were gathering for an entirely different election \u2013 one with virtually no bearing on the balance of power in Washington, but one they believed mattered deeply. There in Missouri\u2019s first congressional district, representative Cori Bush was fighting for her political survival. Many of the twentysomethings had traveled from out of state, sacrificing summer jobs and sleeping on yoga mats to campaign for Bush in the sticky August heat. \u201cWe just stopped our lives and went to St Louis,\u201d said John Paul Mejia, a 22-year-old student and climate activist. Mejia was there as part of Protect Our Power (Pop), a youth coalition that came together earlier this year for what he described as a \u201cDavid-and-Goliath\u201d mission to defend leftwing members of Congress against a well-funded effort to unseat them. To them, Bush, the nurse turned racial justice activist, was one of the few elected leaders who shared their sense of urgency about everything from the country\u2019s affordability crisis to safeguarding abortion access. As a newly elected member of Congress, Bush had slept on the steps of the US Capitol to protest against the expiration of a federal eviction moratorium. The action paid off: the Biden administration extended the pause. In warning about the threat to reproductive rights, Bush testified before a House panel that she had had an abortion at 18 after becoming pregnant by rape. In 2023, she emerged as one of the strongest critics of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, a stance that reflected a groundswell of youth dissent but ultimately imperiled her congressional career. \u201cThere\u2019s pretty much nobody else, even members of Congress who are closer to our age, in some instances, who actually represent what our generation cares about,\u201d Vincent Vertuccio, a 21-year-old college student and an activist with Pop, said of the progressive Squad members. \u201cIf we lose these people, even one or two, it\u2019s a direct diminishment of our power.\u201d Kamala Harris has a significant advantage over Donald Trump among young voters, matching the lead Joe Biden ended up taking in the 2020 election, a new poll finds. The survey from CNBC Generation Lab shows Harris up 20 percentage points with voters aged 18 to 34, with 60% support compared with Trump\u2019s 40%. That\u2019s about the same margin by which Biden won the group four years ago. It\u2019s also an improvement from July, when the vice-president was at 46%, Trump at 34% and independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr picking up 21%. Kennedy has since dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. We\u2019ll see Donald Trump around 11am, when he holds a round table with Latino leaders at his golf resort in Doral, Florida. Then he\u2019ll head to battleground state of North Carolina for a rally in Greensboro at 7pm, making his second visit to the state in as many days. His running mate, JD Vance, will be in Arizona, campaigning in Peoria, outside Phoenix, at 4pm, then again in Tucson at 7.30pm. Democrats are deploying one of their best-known figures as they seek an edge against Donald Trump in the final weeks of the campaign, with Barack Obama holding two events today in swing states Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign covets most. The former president will at 2.30pm appear in Madison, Wisconsin, alongside Tim Walz, then hold a solo event in Detroit at 7.45pm. Walz will stay in Wisconsin, where he has an event in Racine at 7.30pm. The pair\u2019s visit to Wisconsin is to mark the start of early voting in the state, one of three in the Democrats\u2019 \u201cblue wall\u201d along the Great Lakes that are crucial to Harris\u2019s White House hopes. Expect to see a lot more of both Barack and Michelle Obama before this election is through: After a busy day of campaigning with Liz Cheney on Monday, Kamala Harris is having a comparably quiet one today. She has no public campaign events scheduled, but will sit for two interviews. The first is with NBC News\u2019s Hallie Jackson and will air at 6.30pm ET, and the second with Noticias Telemundo\u2019s Julio Vaqueiro, which will be broadcast at 7pm. The vice-president has been doing a lot more interviews and media appearances lately as the election enters the home stretch. Here\u2019s more on that: Thomas Klingenstein, chairperson of the rightwing Claremont Institute, has cemented his place in the pantheon of Republican megadonors with a more than $10m spending spree so far in the 2024 election cycle, according to campaign contributions recorded by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Klingenstein has been one of Claremont\u2019s largest donors for decades. As the institute has made its hard-right, pro-Trump drift in recent years, Klingenstein has continued to publicly describe US politics with extremist rhetoric, calling it a \u201ccold civil war\u201d, and has encouraged rightwingers to join the fight to defeat what he calls \u201cthe woke regime\u201d. His spending puts him at the forefront of a class of donors who are explicitly supporting more extreme and polarizing politics in Trump\u2019s Republican party. The largesse has already dwarfed his contributions in previous election seasons. The money has gone exclusively to Republicans, and has included seven-figure donations to at least four pro-Trump Pacs in recent months. The Guardian emailed Klingenstein for comment on this reporting but received no reply. In the second year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, a young lawyer with crisply shorn blond hair approached the podium at a gathering for Texas members of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group that wields immense power in the US judicial system. As vice-president of the group\u2019s Fort Worth chapter, Matthew Kacsmaryk had the honor of presenting the first speaker. \u201cWe are blessed to have Judge Edith Jones,\u201d Kacsmaryk announced. Jones, a longtime judge on the US fifth circuit court of appeals, stepped on stage to introduce the evening\u2019s guest, her friend, the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. In her introduction, Jones also hailed the four new conservative judges Trump had appointed to join her on the appeals court. \u201cThey\u2019ve raised the bar for the fifth circuit since I got on,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s thanks to the Federalist Society, to Leonard.\u201d Leonard Leo needed no last name in his introduction to this crowd as he took his seat in a black leather chair across from Thomas. The justice was the featured speaker but Leo may have been the most important person in the American legal system in that room \u2013 a conservative activist who had built the Federalist Society into a political powerhouse and helped Trump create the supreme court majority that, in 2022, erased federal protections for abortion. His influence continues to be on display now in one of the most consequential cases moving through the American legal system \u2013 one that seeks to strike another blow to abortion rights and could possibly bankrupt Planned Parenthood, one of the nation\u2019s leading providers of healthcare for women. It\u2019s a lawsuit that has been filed by an anti-abortion activist tied to Leo and heard by judges \u2013 from the lower courts to the fifth circuit appeals court \u2013 who are also linked to Leo. Dustin Guastella, research associate at the Center for Working-Class Politics and the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623, writes: The 2024 campaign has entered the final stretch and, as polls tighten, it seems Kamala Harris plans to lean into attacking Donald Trump as a threat to democracy. Over the past week the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, the Washington Post, the New York Times and even the conservative National Review have all reported or commented on the messaging pivot. In a newly unveiled official campaign ad, a disembodied voice warns gravely that a second Trump term \u201cwould be worse. There would be no one to stop his worst instincts. No guard rails.\u201d At a recent rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Harris reminded her supporters of Project 2025, the \u201cdetailed and dangerous plan\u201d that she believes an \u201cincreasingly unstable and unhinged\u201d Trump will follow to cement \u201cunchecked power\u201d. She sounded the alarm about the dire threat Trump poses to \u201cyour fundamental freedoms\u201d and how in his second term he would be \u201cessentially immune\u201d from oversight. This is hair-raising stuff. And the campaign thinks that menacing warnings like these will motivate some urgency to march to the polls for Harris. The only problem is that voters, especially working-class voters, seem uniquely uninspired by the appeal. Democratic US vice-president Kamala Harris held a marginal 46% to 43% lead over Republican former president Donald Trump, with a glum electorate saying the country is on the wrong track, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found. Harris\u2019 lead in the six-day poll, which closed on Monday, differed little from her 45% to 42% advantage over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted a week earlier, reinforcing the view that the contest is extraordinarily tight with just two weeks left before the 5 November election. Reuters reported: Both polls showed Harris with a lead within the margin of error, with the latest poll showing her ahead just 2 percentage points when using unrounded figures. The new poll showed that voters have a dim view of the state of the economy and immigration \u2013 and they generally favour Trump\u2019s approach on these issues. Some 70% of registered voters in the poll said their cost of living was on the wrong track, while 60% said the economy was heading in the wrong direction and 65% said the same of immigration policy. Voters also said the economy and immigration, together with threats to democracy, were the country\u2019s most important problems. Asked which candidate had the better approach on the issues, Trump led on the economy \u2013 46% to 38% \u2013 and on immigration by 48% to 35%. Immigration also ranked as the number one issue when respondents were asked what the next president should focus on most in their first 100 days in office. Some 35% picked immigration, with 11% citing income inequality and equal 10% shares citing healthcare and taxes. But Trump fared poorly on the question of which candidate was better to address political extremism and threats to democracy, with Harris leading 42% to 35%. She also led on abortion policy and on healthcare policy. Liz Cheney, a former Republican congresswoman and longtime opponent of abortion rights, on Monday condemned Republican-imposed bans on the procedure and urged conservatives to support Democrat Kamala Harris for US president. Cheney was speaking during three joint events with the vice-president in three swing states aimed at prising suburban Republican voters away from party nominee Donald Trump. She has become the Democrat\u2019s most prominent conservative surrogate and is rumoured to be in contention for a seat in a potential Harris cabinet. At the final event in Waukesha, Wisconsin, against a blue backdrop patterned with the words \u201ccountry over party\u201d, Cheney, 58, suggested that Republican-led states have overreached in restricting abortion since the supreme court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision ended it as a constitutional right. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life and I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states since Dobbs,\u201d said the former Wyoming congresswoman and daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney. \u201cI have been troubled by the extent to which you have women who \u2013 as the vice-president said, in some cases have died \u2013 who can\u2019t get medical treatment that they need because providers are worried about criminal liability.\u201d Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail, with polling day now just two weeks away. We start with the news that Donald Trump has urged Christian voters on Monday to participate in the 2024 election, claiming that a Kamala Harris administration would restrict religious freedoms and casting himself as a protector of Christians. During an event in North Carolina billed as an \u201c11th-Hour Faith Leaders Meeting\u201d, a series of conservative pastors warmed up for Trump, including Guillermo Maldonado, an \u201capostle\u201d and longtime Trump ally who cast the election in perilous terms. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re now in spiritual warfare,\u201d said Maldonado, alluding to the idea that Christians are at war on the supernatural plane against dark forces that affect the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond warfare between the left and the right. It\u2019s between good and evil. There\u2019s a big fight right now that is affecting our country and we need to take back our country.\u201d Introducing Trump, Ben Carson, the campaign\u2019s National Faith Chairman for the 2024 election, openly rejected the idea of secular society. \u201cThis election is about whether we are a secular nation or one nation under God,\u201d said Carson, echoing the aims of Christian nationalists who view the US as a Christian nation that must return to God. In other news: Liz Cheney, former Republican congresswoman and longtime opponent of abortion rights, condemned Republican bans on the procedure and urged conservatives on Monday to support Kamala Harris. Jill Biden acknowledged on Monday that her husband made \u201cthe right call\u201d by stepping down from his run for re-election. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, said Elon Musk\u2019s plan to give away $1m a day in support of Donald Trump is a reflection of a ticket with \u201cno plan\u201d. The Central Park Five sued Trump for defamation after he falsely said during the presidential debate that they had pleaded guilty to a brutal rape 35 years ago, despite the fact that they had their convictions overturned. A Republican county supervisor in Arizona who refused to certify the 2022 midterm election has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The politics writer Olivia Nuzzi and New York magazine have parted ways after she was placed on leave following the disclosure that she had engaged in a \u201cpersonal\u201d relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr. Key rightwing legal groups tied to Trump and his allies have banked millions of dollars from conservative foundations and filed multiple lawsuits challenging voting rules in swing states. Trump doubled down on false claims about the federal government\u2019s hurricane recovery efforts and promoted baseless conspiracy theories about immigration.",

      "bodyText": "Roman Polanski, the Oscar-winning film director who fled the US decades ago after admitting to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old, will no longer face trial over an alleged sexual assault of another minor after reaching a settlement. The latest case against the now 91-year-old director, which concerned an alleged sexual attack in 1973, had been due in civil court in Los Angeles next August. The civil suit, filed last year, claimed Polanski took a then-teenager \u2013 named anonymously in filings as Jane Doe \u2013 to dinner at a restaurant in Los Angeles in 1973. The lawsuit alleged that he gave her tequila, and when she began to feel dizzy, drove her to his home, where she alleged he sexually assaulted her. \u201cShe told him: \u2018Please don\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Gloria Allred, told reporters in March, saying the alleged assault caused the plaintiff \u201ctremendous physical, emotional pain and suffering\u201d. But the case was \u201csettled in the summer to the parties\u2019 mutual satisfaction and has now been formally dismissed,\u201d Polanski\u2019s lawyer, Alexander Rufus-Isaacs told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday. Allred confirmed this to the Guardian, saying a settlement of claims was agreed \u201cto their mutual satisfaction\u201d. The lawsuit, which sought unspecified damages, was filed in June 2023, just before the expiration of a California law that allowed for an extended window for claims against the alleged perpetrators of sexual crimes. Court papers filed in California in July said a \u201cconditional\u201d accord had been reached. Polanski is a divisive figure. He admitted to the statutory rape of 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in a plea bargain in 1977 to avoid a trial on more serious charges. But he fled to France the following year, after serving 42 days in jail, when it appeared a judge was reconsidering his release. He has been a fugitive from the US ever since. Geimer has subsequently defended Polanski, and was photographed with him last year. Four women came forward between 2017 and 2019 accusing Polanski of abusing them in the 1970s \u2013 three of them were allegedly minors at the time \u2013 including artist Marianne Barnard, who said Polanski sexually assaulted her when she was 10. Charlotte Lewis, a British actor, in 2010 accused Polanski of sexually assaulting her in 1983 when she was 16. Polanski has denied all of the allegations. In May, a French court acquitted Polanski of defaming Lewis after he denied raping her when she was a teenager. \u2013 Agence France Press contributed to this report.

Katter spoke about his intention to revive a \u201cbabies born alive\u201d bill that would mandate life-saving interventions on the extremely rare occasions where an unviable foetus is born alive. Healthcare professionals say claims by anti-choice lobby groups about the situation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/28/australian-conservatives-claim-babies-are-sometimes-born-alive-after-an-abortion-whats-the-truth\">amount to misinformation</a>.</p> \n<p>Reports claiming Katter has backtracked appear to misunderstand that re-introducing this bill proposes to amend the Termination of Pregnancy Act. It is \u2013 by definition \u2013 a wind back of abortion laws.</p> \n<p>Regardless, the prospect of a conscience vote has put significant focus on the personal views of LNP MPs and candidates. Many have previously been on record opposing abortion rights; none has been willing to answer questions about those views during the campaign.</p> \n<p>One LNP candidate \u2013 a former MP who once <a href=\"https://www.endeavourforum.org.au/newsletter/156/speech-from-hansard.html\">claimed abortions increased a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer</a> \u2013 told voters that she was \u201cpro-life\u201d but that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/18/qld-election-2024-freya-ostapovitch-lnp-stretton-candidate-abortion-ntwnfb\">couldn\u2019t \u201csay anything yet because we have got to get elected\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Crisafulli\u2019s previously unreported remarks <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/821505321\">at a Griffith University</a> event on 31 May 2023 \u2013 that he did not \u201cbelieve in\u201d late-term abortion, that Labor\u2019s laws went \u201ctoo far\u201d but that he would not support re-criminalisation \u2013 are likely to add further pressure.</p> \n<p>When Crisafulli took charge, the LNP was riddled with factional infighting \u2013 most notably involving members of the rightwing \u201cChristian soldiers\u201d faction but also grassroots unrest at the organisational leadership. The party was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/14/what-is-our-raison-detre-queenslands-lnp-struggles-with-identity-crisis-after-election-drubbing\">directionless</a> and almost locked out of inner-Brisbane, where voters have been put off by the party\u2019s conservative social policies at state level.</p> \n<p>Crisafulli was asked at the Griffith event about why \u201cfierce ideological battles\u201d had become apparent on the conservative side of politics.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer that with two words: not here,\u201d Crisafulli said.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven my harshest of critics will acknowledge the unity and discipline of the Queensland LNP is at a level it\u2019s never been before and it hasn\u2019t happened by chance.\u201d</p> \n<p>That unity and discipline has brought the LNP to the brink of an election victory but the divisions within the party remain. Earlier this year, the Christian right won control of a branch covering the state\u2019s most progressive federal electorate \u2013 Griffith, held by the Greens. Its new president is Alan Baker, a veteran anti-abortion campaigner.</p> \n<p>The other key problem for Crisafulli is that the LNP can not point back to any sort of record of success running a more modern Queensland. The last long-term conservative government in the state was from the Bjelke-Petersen era.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/oct/22/rugby-australia-wallabies-uk-lions-tour-series-preview\">Wallabies seek to spring a grand slam surprise as Lions tour looms large | Angus Fontaine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Since the merger of the Liberal and National parties, conservatives have only won one election \u2013 a landslide victory in 2012 that brought Campbell Newman to power with the country\u2019s largest ever majority, and ended after only a term.</p> \n<p>During that time Newman \u2013 elected after campaigning as a moderate \u2013 inherited a party of candidates who had not been expected to win, and a caucus where the Christian right had significant influence. It scrapped same-sex civil unions and was embarrassingly swept from power.</p> \n<p>Labor is exploiting the issue because it knows it puts the LNP\u2019s candidates and grassroots membership at odds with the general public.</p> \n<p>But ironically, it could be the Greens who suffer most from the focus on abortion. Sources say abortion will likely have the biggest impact in middle-class electorates, where most voters are university educated. These are, in many cases, seats where Labor is under pressure from the Greens, rather than the LNP.</p> \n<p>Greens MPs would vote in a bloc to support abortion rights \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t have a conscience vote like the major parties \u2013 but the threat to them remains that traditional Labor voters in these seats might stick with the party if it puts progressive social issues front and centre.</p> \n<p>Outside Brisbane, the issue could cut through in another way.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Miles compared Crisafulli to the Townsville mayor, Troy Thompson, who was elected in a protest vote and quickly came under pressure to resign amid an investigation into his claims about his military service.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt underlines what can happen when you elect someone who is unknown. The people of Townsville didn\u2019t really know what they were getting with Troy Thompson and that\u2019s worked out really badly. And that could happen with David Crisafulli. He\u2019s hiding his views on so many important issues\u201d.</p> \n<p>There is a contradiction between Crisafulli\u2019s comments on Tuesday, that he is pro-choice, and his statement in 2023 that he did not believe in late-term abortions.</p> \n<p>There is a contradiction between his steadfast defence of the right to a conscience vote a year ago and his continued refusal to make a clear statement about it these past few weeks.</p> \n<p>While those contradictions remain, so will doubts remain in the minds of many voters.</p>",

When Crisafulli took charge, the LNP was riddled with factional infighting \u2013 most notably involving members of the rightwing \u201cChristian soldiers\u201d faction but also grassroots unrest at the organisational leadership. The party was directionless and almost locked out of inner-Brisbane, where voters have been put off by the party\u2019s conservative social policies at state level. Crisafulli was asked at the Griffith event about why \u201cfierce ideological battles\u201d had become apparent on the conservative side of politics. \u201cI\u2019ll answer that with two words: not here,\u201d Crisafulli said. \u201cEven my harshest of critics will acknowledge the unity and discipline of the Queensland LNP is at a level it\u2019s never been before and it hasn\u2019t happened by chance.\u201d That unity and discipline has brought the LNP to the brink of an election victory but the divisions within the party remain. Earlier this year, the Christian right won control of a branch covering the state\u2019s most progressive federal electorate \u2013 Griffith, held by the Greens. Its new president is Alan Baker, a veteran anti-abortion campaigner. The other key problem for Crisafulli is that the LNP can not point back to any sort of record of success running a more modern Queensland. The last long-term conservative government in the state was from the Bjelke-Petersen era. Since the merger of the Liberal and National parties, conservatives have only won one election \u2013 a landslide victory in 2012 that brought Campbell Newman to power with the country\u2019s largest ever majority, and ended after only a term. During that time Newman \u2013 elected after campaigning as a moderate \u2013 inherited a party of candidates who had not been expected to win, and a caucus where the Christian right had significant influence. It scrapped same-sex civil unions and was embarrassingly swept from power. Labor is exploiting the issue because it knows it puts the LNP\u2019s candidates and grassroots membership at odds with the general public. But ironically, it could be the Greens who suffer most from the focus on abortion. Sources say abortion will likely have the biggest impact in middle-class electorates, where most voters are university educated. These are, in many cases, seats where Labor is under pressure from the Greens, rather than the LNP. Greens MPs would vote in a bloc to support abortion rights \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t have a conscience vote like the major parties \u2013 but the threat to them remains that traditional Labor voters in these seats might stick with the party if it puts progressive social issues front and centre. Outside Brisbane, the issue could cut through in another way. On Tuesday, Miles compared Crisafulli to the Townsville mayor, Troy Thompson, who was elected in a protest vote and quickly came under pressure to resign amid an investigation into his claims about his military service. \u201cIt underlines what can happen when you elect someone who is unknown. The people of Townsville didn\u2019t really know what they were getting with Troy Thompson and that\u2019s worked out really badly. And that could happen with David Crisafulli. He\u2019s hiding his views on so many important issues\u201d. There is a contradiction between Crisafulli\u2019s comments on Tuesday, that he is pro-choice, and his statement in 2023 that he did not believe in late-term abortions. There is a contradiction between his steadfast defence of the right to a conscience vote a year ago and his continued refusal to make a clear statement about it these past few weeks. While those contradictions remain, so will doubts remain in the minds of many voters.",
