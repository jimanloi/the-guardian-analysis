The FDA said then that 22 people out of the 61 about whom information was available had been hospitalized.

The E coli strain that has caused the death of one person is said to cause \u201cvery serious disease\u201d, especially for the elderly, children and people who are immunocompromised. Initial findings of the FDA, as well as the company, showed slivered onions used in the quarter pounder was the likely source of the outbreak and it was supplied by a single supplier that serves three distribution centers. Taylor Farms was the supplier for the affected locations and McDonald\u2019s has initiated a voluntary recall, the company and the agency have said.

In an effort to counter China\u2019s influence, ministers will expand the Royal Navy\u2019s presence in the region and carry out more joint patrols with Pacific island nations. The prime minister has warned that the UK \u201ccannot turn a blind eye\u201d to challenges its allies face on the other side of the world. He will announce the plans as he prepares to fly home from Samoa, where he has been attending the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm). The navy patrols will focus on maritime security, combatting illegal fishing and responding to the natural disasters that blight the South Pacific, one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world. The UK has two patrol vessels persistently deployed in the Indo-Pacific, including HMS Tamar, which has been supporting Samoa with security at Chogm. Ministers will also set up a Pacific business club alongside Australia and cooperate on renewable energy projects with New Zealand. Geopolitical competition for influence in the South Pacific is growing rapidly, sparking concerns about the militarisation of the region. The Guardian has reported on the proliferation of military and security agreements between Pacific countries and Australia, the US and China, with western powers responding to China\u2019s growing presence. \u201cMy visit to the Pacific this week has only reinforced how important this part of the world is to the United Kingdom\u2019s prosperity and security, and I know across business, trade and defence we play a vital role in supporting the region too,\u201d Starmer said in a statement. \u201cAs responsible international players, we cannot turn a blind eye to the challenges faced by our friends and partners on the other side of the world, so my message today is clear: this is just the beginning of our commitment to the Indo-Pacific.\u201d After a foreign policy and security review they carried out in 2021, the Conservatives under Boris Johnson announced an \u201cIndo-Pacific tilt\u201d in which the UK would focus on building trade and security ties with the region.

He projects the latest policy will put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/sep/11/australian-universities-say-they-are-being-treated-like-political-footballs-in-scathing-critique-of-student-cap\">14,000 university jobs</a> at risk.</p> <p>How did we get here, and are the caps to blame?</p>  <h2>Who is shedding jobs?</h2>  <p>Universities in Queensland, Canberra and New South Wales have all announced staff cuts in the past month as part of significant restructures to stave off major deficits.</p> <p>Last week, the Australian National University (ANU) announced 87 job losses across three divisions after previously cutting 50 jobs from its college of health and medicine.</p> <p>Its vice-chancellor,<strong> </strong>Prof Genevieve Bell, said $250m in savings were needed by the end of next year, including $100m in salaries. She has requested staff consider forgoing an upcoming 2.5% pay increase to stave off a potential loss of 638 jobs.</p> <p>The University of Canberra followed on Monday, with its vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Parker, advising staff $50m must be taken out of recurrent expenditure to 2025, which would remove \u201cat least\u201d 200 staffing positions, including up to nine in senior management.</p> <p>In Queensland, James Cook University will cut 67 positions in addition to more than 100 lost in the year to 2023, while Griffith University has also advised staff there will be \u201cfewer than 50\u201d redundancies due to \u201csignificant financial losses\u201d.</p> <p>The University of Southern Queensland is yet to detail exactly how many jobs will be cut but has advised staff it needs to fill a $32m budget hole. The union estimates 60 jobs have been lost already.</p> <p>Macquarie University\u2019s dean of arts, Prof Chris Dixon, has warned of significant reductions to casual staff from 2025, while the University of Wollongong began a \u201cworkplace change process\u201d on Wednesday, with the union estimating more than 200 staff would be cut due to a $35m drop in revenue.</p> <h2>Why are the cuts necessary?</h2>  <p>Universities have pointed to ongoing financial pressures \u2013 including recent federal government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/05/australia-international-students-visa-university\">changes to migration</a> that has resulted in 60,000 fewer visas being granted in the higher education sector.</p> <p>A spokesperson for ANU said the operating environment for universities had changed \u201csignificantly\u201d and its deficit could no longer be addressed by increasing revenue from student enrolments.</p> <p>Interim vice-chancellor of the UoW, Prof John Dewar, said the sector was facing a period of \u201cunprecedented government reform\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn our current financial circumstances, we must focus on our strengths in teaching and research, which means that we must consider discontinuing some areas of teaching where we have low student demand and areas of research activity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Parker has been more frank. He told a staff town hall that slowing international student numbers had been a factor in UC\u2019s poor financial performance, but laid the responsibility with the university for its \u201cunsustainable position\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot expect any external assistance and must take urgent and significant measures to re-balance the institution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no point in blaming others.\u201d</p> <h2>How have academics reacted?</h2>  <p>Academics have been scathing in their critique, with the National Tertiary Education Union (Nteu) president, Prof Alison Barnes, laying blame <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/26/australia-university-staff-international-student-cuts-labor-policy\">squarely with \u201cshocking mismanagement</a>\u201d. <br><br>\u201cUnless we see urgent governance reform, our cherished public universities will continue to suffer from the mismanagement of unaccountable and overpaid vice-chancellors,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Nteu UniSQ branch president, Prof Andrea Lamont-Mills, said colleagues left behind would be \u201cforced to shoulder massive workload burdens\u201d which would have a flow-on effect to student learning.</p> <p>\u201cIt points to a major failure by management to keep the university in financial health,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The JCU Nteu branch president, Dr Jonathan Strauss, was among those whose role was proposed to be axed.

      "bodyText": "More than 1,000 jobs could be lost across seven universities as part of major budgetary cuts announced in recent weeks, prompting fears the international student crackdown is placing the sector at a tipping point. The government is hoping to pass its student cap bill next month, which would set course limits for institutions across the higher education sector to bring total enrolments down to 270,000 from 2025. But universities are already feeling the impacts of a strain on foreign enrolments, with Universities Australia\u2019s head, Luke Sheehy, warning ongoing migration reforms have already cost the economy $4.3bn. He projects the latest policy will put 14,000 university jobs at risk. How did we get here, and are the caps to blame? Who is shedding jobs? Universities in Queensland, Canberra and New South Wales have all announced staff cuts in the past month as part of significant restructures to stave off major deficits. Last week, the Australian National University (ANU) announced 87 job losses across three divisions after previously cutting 50 jobs from its college of health and medicine. Its vice-chancellor, Prof Genevieve Bell, said $250m in savings were needed by the end of next year, including $100m in salaries. She has requested staff consider forgoing an upcoming 2.5% pay increase to stave off a potential loss of 638 jobs. The University of Canberra followed on Monday, with its vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Parker, advising staff $50m must be taken out of recurrent expenditure to 2025, which would remove \u201cat least\u201d 200 staffing positions, including up to nine in senior management. In Queensland, James Cook University will cut 67 positions in addition to more than 100 lost in the year to 2023, while Griffith University has also advised staff there will be \u201cfewer than 50\u201d redundancies due to \u201csignificant financial losses\u201d. The University of Southern Queensland is yet to detail exactly how many jobs will be cut but has advised staff it needs to fill a $32m budget hole. The union estimates 60 jobs have been lost already. Macquarie University\u2019s dean of arts, Prof Chris Dixon, has warned of significant reductions to casual staff from 2025, while the University of Wollongong began a \u201cworkplace change process\u201d on Wednesday, with the union estimating more than 200 staff would be cut due to a $35m drop in revenue. Why are the cuts necessary? Universities have pointed to ongoing financial pressures \u2013 including recent federal government changes to migration that has resulted in 60,000 fewer visas being granted in the higher education sector. A spokesperson for ANU said the operating environment for universities had changed \u201csignificantly\u201d and its deficit could no longer be addressed by increasing revenue from student enrolments. Interim vice-chancellor of the UoW, Prof John Dewar, said the sector was facing a period of \u201cunprecedented government reform\u201d. \u201cIn our current financial circumstances, we must focus on our strengths in teaching and research, which means that we must consider discontinuing some areas of teaching where we have low student demand and areas of research activity,\u201d he said. Parker has been more frank. He told a staff town hall that slowing international student numbers had been a factor in UC\u2019s poor financial performance, but laid the responsibility with the university for its \u201cunsustainable position\u201d. \u201cWe cannot expect any external assistance and must take urgent and significant measures to re-balance the institution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no point in blaming others.\u201d How have academics reacted? Academics have been scathing in their critique, with the National Tertiary Education Union (Nteu) president, Prof Alison Barnes, laying blame squarely with \u201cshocking mismanagement\u201d. \u201cUnless we see urgent governance reform, our cherished public universities will continue to suffer from the mismanagement of unaccountable and overpaid vice-chancellors,\u201d she said. Nteu UniSQ branch president, Prof Andrea Lamont-Mills, said colleagues left behind would be \u201cforced to shoulder massive workload burdens\u201d which would have a flow-on effect to student learning. \u201cIt points to a major failure by management to keep the university in financial health,\u201d she said. The JCU Nteu branch president, Dr Jonathan Strauss, was among those whose role was proposed to be axed. He said the cuts were a result of a \u201cdecade-long decline\u201d in student enrolments that wouldn\u2019t be reversed by shedding jobs, while Queensland division secretary, Michael McNally, said the cuts were \u201cpremature\u201d when JCU\u2019s proposed international student cap was higher than current enrolments. What happens next? The federal government will have two weeks to pass its student cap bill when parliament nexts sits in November. A Senate committee earlier this month recommended significant amendments, including removing the ability to set course-level enrolment limits. Greens deputy leader and spokesperson for higher education, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, has lobbied against the bill. She said universities were \u201cin strife\u201d as a result of the \u201cunabated\u201d corporatisation of the sector. \u201cRampant casualisation, wage theft and enormous workloads were already crushing staff, and now hundreds will be without a job,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should be VC salaries that are cut, not staff jobs.\u201d This week, the education minister, Jason Clare, announced an expert council on university governance would be established to address rising concerns, beginning in December.

Last year, 21 officers were charged. Since 2017, 120 officers have been charged.</p> <p>The data did not show the number of convictions. But in August the NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, told parliament during budget estimates that of the nine police officers charged by that time in 2024, one had been convicted, one had received a non-conviction and seven remained before the courts.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>She also said 54 officers currently serving in NSW police have, at some time, been charged with a total of 91 DV offences, including stalking, contravening an ADVO and assault occasioning bodily harm. Two of those 54 officers have been convicted.</p> <h2>Access to guns and police database</h2> <p>Sam Lee, a solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre in Sydney\u2019s inner-west, says she thinks the rate of domestic violence within police forces is likely even higher. This is because, she says, victim-survivors are even more reluctant to report abuse when the alleged perpetrator is a police officer. She says victim-survivors often seek support from the legal centre.</p> <p>\u201cI deal a fair bit with women who tried to report DV in relation to their ex or current partner who\u2019s a police officer \u2026 and (they) are often dismissed, or they\u2019re just too scared to go in and report it,\u201d Lee says.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re very scared of the repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>It is a \u201cunique\u201d situation, Lee says, because police officers \u201chave firearms\u201d and the many women have \u201ca lot of concerns about the partner accessing their information via the cops\u2019 database about where they live\u201d.</p> <p>That was the case for Annie.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the ranking structure and position of my [ex-partner], I was concerned he would ask a junior or very new probationary constable to try find information out about me so it wasn\u2019t recorded under his login.\u201d</p>    <p>A NSW police spokesperson said if an officer is charged with a domestic violence offence and remains in the workplace then their access to the police database is decided on a case by case basis. The decision takes into account the alleged offences and duties of the officer. The officer\u2019s gun is also secured and double padlocked, according to a recent report by the NSW police watchdog.</p> <p>During budget estimates, Webb told parliament that a risk assessment of the officer is also conducted by their commander.</p> <p>\u201cThat often results in suspension or some other form of action, sometimes pending the court outcome,\u201d Webb said, adding that as commissioner she can also consider officer\u2019s employment outside a court outcome.</p> <h2>Possible to be impartial?</h2> <p>Last year, a police watchdog report into NSW police\u2019s response to domestic and family violence recommended police not investigate potential offenders inside their command when domestic violence allegations are made.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter how impartial an investigator may be when investigating another officer who is known to them or works in close proximity to them, victims and others may perceive that such investigations will not be impartial,\u201d the report stated.</p> <p>The police did not support this recommendation, citing operational impracticalities. Police also said the Professional Standards Command can conduct an investigation if they determine any conflicts can\u2019t be appropriately managed.</p> <p>The report, though it was not a final recommendation, also raised the unit Victoria police launched in 2021, an Australian-first to investigate domestic violence within its ranks to eliminate conflicts of interest.</p> <p>The report also flagged that officers convicted on DV charges or the subject of an ADVO could create a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d, given they could likely attend domestic and family violence incidents.</p> <p>For the majority of domestic violence incidents, police are the first responders. Domestic violence calls make up an estimated 40% of all police work in NSW. There is no policy or procedure for the close supervision of an officer who remains in the force after they\u2019re convicted of a DV offence, the report said.</p> <p>Webb told parliament in August that about 75% of investigations into police officers alleged to have committed domestic violence were conducted by a different command. She said 25%, totalling six, were conducted by the command where the officer worked.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is that mentality of \u2018brothers in blue, protect our own\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Annie*</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Several months after Annie reported her partner, the investigation was dropped by police without an explanation. Charges were never laid. Her ex-partner has since been promoted, she says.</p> <p>She believes police shouldn\u2019t investigate police, even when they are in a different command.</p> <p>\u201cThere is that mentality of \u2018brothers in blue, protect our own\u2019,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Investigations should at the very least be undertaken by an independent taskforce, like in Victoria, she says. But Annie would prefer it was conducted by the police watchdog.</p> <p>Lee, from Redfern Legal, agrees. Katrina Ironside, from Women\u2019s Legal Service NSW, also wants to see alternate independent reporting and investigation mechanisms.</p> <p>\u201cVictim survivors of family and domestic violence routinely report feeling unsafe reporting to the police.

But in August the NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, told parliament during budget estimates that of the nine police officers charged by that time in 2024, one had been convicted, one had received a non-conviction and seven remained before the courts. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email She also said 54 officers currently serving in NSW police have, at some time, been charged with a total of 91 DV offences, including stalking, contravening an ADVO and assault occasioning bodily harm. Two of those 54 officers have been convicted. Access to guns and police database Sam Lee, a solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre in Sydney\u2019s inner-west, says she thinks the rate of domestic violence within police forces is likely even higher. This is because, she says, victim-survivors are even more reluctant to report abuse when the alleged perpetrator is a police officer. She says victim-survivors often seek support from the legal centre. \u201cI deal a fair bit with women who tried to report DV in relation to their ex or current partner who\u2019s a police officer \u2026 and (they) are often dismissed, or they\u2019re just too scared to go in and report it,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThey\u2019re very scared of the repercussions.\u201d It is a \u201cunique\u201d situation, Lee says, because police officers \u201chave firearms\u201d and the many women have \u201ca lot of concerns about the partner accessing their information via the cops\u2019 database about where they live\u201d. That was the case for Annie. \u201cGiven the ranking structure and position of my [ex-partner], I was concerned he would ask a junior or very new probationary constable to try find information out about me so it wasn\u2019t recorded under his login.\u201d A NSW police spokesperson said if an officer is charged with a domestic violence offence and remains in the workplace then their access to the police database is decided on a case by case basis. The decision takes into account the alleged offences and duties of the officer. The officer\u2019s gun is also secured and double padlocked, according to a recent report by the NSW police watchdog. During budget estimates, Webb told parliament that a risk assessment of the officer is also conducted by their commander. \u201cThat often results in suspension or some other form of action, sometimes pending the court outcome,\u201d Webb said, adding that as commissioner she can also consider officer\u2019s employment outside a court outcome. Possible to be impartial? Last year, a police watchdog report into NSW police\u2019s response to domestic and family violence recommended police not investigate potential offenders inside their command when domestic violence allegations are made. \u201cNo matter how impartial an investigator may be when investigating another officer who is known to them or works in close proximity to them, victims and others may perceive that such investigations will not be impartial,\u201d the report stated. The police did not support this recommendation, citing operational impracticalities. Police also said the Professional Standards Command can conduct an investigation if they determine any conflicts can\u2019t be appropriately managed. The report, though it was not a final recommendation, also raised the unit Victoria police launched in 2021, an Australian-first to investigate domestic violence within its ranks to eliminate conflicts of interest. The report also flagged that officers convicted on DV charges or the subject of an ADVO could create a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d, given they could likely attend domestic and family violence incidents. For the majority of domestic violence incidents, police are the first responders. Domestic violence calls make up an estimated 40% of all police work in NSW. There is no policy or procedure for the close supervision of an officer who remains in the force after they\u2019re convicted of a DV offence, the report said. Webb told parliament in August that about 75% of investigations into police officers alleged to have committed domestic violence were conducted by a different command. She said 25%, totalling six, were conducted by the command where the officer worked. Several months after Annie reported her partner, the investigation was dropped by police without an explanation. Charges were never laid. Her ex-partner has since been promoted, she says. She believes police shouldn\u2019t investigate police, even when they are in a different command. \u201cThere is that mentality of \u2018brothers in blue, protect our own\u2019,\u201d she says. Investigations should at the very least be undertaken by an independent taskforce, like in Victoria, she says. But Annie would prefer it was conducted by the police watchdog. Lee, from Redfern Legal, agrees. Katrina Ironside, from Women\u2019s Legal Service NSW, also wants to see alternate independent reporting and investigation mechanisms. \u201cVictim survivors of family and domestic violence routinely report feeling unsafe reporting to the police. Women\u2019s Legal often hear that police don\u2019t take reports seriously and don\u2019t take any action,\u201d she says. A spokesperson for NSW police said the force was committed to continually improving the way it responds to and prevents domestic and family violence. They pointed to the domestic and family violence reform project, which \u201cwas established in 2022 with a focus of prioritising the health and well-being of victims by targeting those who perpetuate violence\u201d. The spokesperson said \u201ca specialist policing team\u201d - the NSW police force\u2019s Domestic and Family Violence Registry \u2013 was established after the report. \u201c[It] is driving strategies for the prevention, disruption, and investigation into domestic and family violence in NSW.\u201d * Names have been changed to protect this person\u2019s identity. \u2022 In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

Indeed, he began his almost 30-year Senate career at the very election, 1993, that Paul Keating claimed had been a \u201cvictory for the true believers\u201d.</p> <p>His career was devoted to the proposition that if Australia embraced new technologies and developed the right skill base, it could still make things \u2013 an idea that seems to be fashionable in federal Labor government circles again.</p> <p>It, therefore, matters that he has joined the growing number of former senior Labor politicians who have become increasingly critical of the direction of the Albanese government.</p> <p>Carr is critical of the small target strategy that Anthony Albanese used to get into office, his policies being \u201cmore like running repairs than substantial reforms\u201d. The party, says Carr, has become alienated from low-income voters, leaning in to an \u201cidentity politics\u201d that has caused it to lose touch with its traditional support base \u2013 whose welfare was really Labor\u2019s <em>raison d\u2019\u00eatre</em>.</p> <p>Carr could fairly be described as \u201cold school Labor\u201d.

He was a senior minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments, as minister for innovation, industry, science and research. He played an important role in forming the Rudd-Gillard \u201cdream team\u201d in 2006. He was a victim of its later disintegration, which resulted in Julia Gillard\u2019s demotion of him.</p> <p>Carr cannot be dismissed as a lone voice, for he is among several former Labor heavyweights deeply worried about the government\u2019s direction. Others include former New South Wales premier Bob Carr, former foreign minister Gareth Evans and \u2013 the hardest critic of all \u2013 former prime minister Paul Keating, all mostly concerned with Aukus. Bill Kelty, an architect of Labor\u2019s Accord of the 1980s and 1990s and former Australian Council of Trade Unions leader of deep influence in that era, has described the government as \u201cmired in mediocrity\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/24/kevin-rudd-had-secret-agreement-with-julia-gillard-to-hand-over-power-after-two-terms-new-book-reveals\">Kevin Rudd had secret agreement with Julia Gillard to hand over power after two terms, new book claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recent media commentary suggests that some present government members, including Albanese, are finding this running commentary frustrating. But it is not new for former leaders to criticise aspects of government policy from the sidelines after they have ceased to be active politicians. Gough Whitlam had some hard things to say about the government run by Bob Hawke and Keating on occasion, such as the reintroduction of university fees. Keating was critical of the Whitlam government\u2019s economic performance. Whitlam responded in kind, calling him \u201ca smart-arse\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The moniker \u201ctrue believer\u201d could almost have been invented for Kim Carr. Indeed, he began his almost 30-year Senate career at the very election, 1993, that Paul Keating claimed had been a \u201cvictory for the true believers\u201d. His career was devoted to the proposition that if Australia embraced new technologies and developed the right skill base, it could still make things \u2013 an idea that seems to be fashionable in federal Labor government circles again. It, therefore, matters that he has joined the growing number of former senior Labor politicians who have become increasingly critical of the direction of the Albanese government. Carr is critical of the small target strategy that Anthony Albanese used to get into office, his policies being \u201cmore like running repairs than substantial reforms\u201d. The party, says Carr, has become alienated from low-income voters, leaning in to an \u201cidentity politics\u201d that has caused it to lose touch with its traditional support base \u2013 whose welfare was really Labor\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Carr could fairly be described as \u201cold school Labor\u201d. His memoir, A Long March, published this month by Monash University Publishing, does nothing to dispel that impression. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Carr, the product of a working-class family \u2013 his father was a boilermaker \u2013 joined the Labor party in 1975 amid the outrage over the dismissal of the Whitlam government. He was a senior minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments, as minister for innovation, industry, science and research. He played an important role in forming the Rudd-Gillard \u201cdream team\u201d in 2006. He was a victim of its later disintegration, which resulted in Julia Gillard\u2019s demotion of him. Carr cannot be dismissed as a lone voice, for he is among several former Labor heavyweights deeply worried about the government\u2019s direction. Others include former New South Wales premier Bob Carr, former foreign minister Gareth Evans and \u2013 the hardest critic of all \u2013 former prime minister Paul Keating, all mostly concerned with Aukus. Bill Kelty, an architect of Labor\u2019s Accord of the 1980s and 1990s and former Australian Council of Trade Unions leader of deep influence in that era, has described the government as \u201cmired in mediocrity\u201d. Recent media commentary suggests that some present government members, including Albanese, are finding this running commentary frustrating. But it is not new for former leaders to criticise aspects of government policy from the sidelines after they have ceased to be active politicians. Gough Whitlam had some hard things to say about the government run by Bob Hawke and Keating on occasion, such as the reintroduction of university fees. Keating was critical of the Whitlam government\u2019s economic performance. Whitlam responded in kind, calling him \u201ca smart-arse\u201d. No one seemed unduly worried on either side. It seems different now. While getting re-elected was no doddle in the 1980s and 1990s, governments seem to have an even more precarious existence these days. If they are more sensitive to the criticism of party elders, it possibly reflects a stronger sense of the fragility of their hold on power. There is also the question of whether the critics are imagining a past that was better than it actually was. Carr can sometimes seem nostalgic for a Labor party able to rely on a large base of blue-collar workers and their families for support in an economy that still employed large numbers of workers in manufacturing, mining and transport. Senior Labor figures of the 1980s on the right of the party, such as Keating or Bob Carr, who were notably pro-American when in office, can seem inconsistent or even hypocritical when offering meaty criticism of the government for positioning itself too closely to the United States today.

Works on loan from the National Gallery of Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria are also on display, including one of the artist\u2019s most recognisable and unsettling works, The Lovers. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Presented chronologically, the collection of more than 100 works takes the viewer on an evolutionary journey of one of the 20th century\u2019s most influential artists; from his pragmatic beginnings as a commercial illustrator in the advertising industry post first world war; to his foray into cubism and futurism in the 1920s; his subsequent move to Paris and his transition to the surrealist movement; and finally, his gravitation towards works of scale, influenced by an American art scene on the brink of pop art and culture. With his recurring motifs of everyday objects \u2013 bowler hats and pipes, clouds and green apples \u2013 Magritte took the ordinary and placed it in extraordinary settings, challenging his audiences preconceived perceptions of reality. \u201cTo be a surrealist means barring from your mind all remembrance of what you have seen, and being always on the lookout for what has never been,\u201d is one of the artist\u2019s many memorable quotes. Various iterations of his wife and muse Georgette, whom he married in 1922, can also be found throughout the exhibition across all the artist\u2019s various phases, which in this retrospective are divided into six distinct periods. \u201cHis art has been contextualised in surrealist survey exhibitions in previous decades, but the evolution of his art and the profound impact that it\u2019s had on late 20th and even 21st century culture is not widely known,\u201d says Chambers. And while many of his images exude a disturbing or haunting aura, audiences need to keep in the forefront of their minds the enduring humour the artist brought to many of his works. \u201cMagritte was a real prankster, quite a rascal, actually,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cThere is this sort of irreverent, subversive sense of humour, sometimes less explicit, sometimes very overt. He took great pleasure in creating these paintings and while many of them engage with very serious philosophical ideas, humour is always present.\u201d Here are six of Magritte\u2019s seminal works that make up the AGNSW Magritte exhibition: Self portrait 1923 The cubist work was created soon after Magritte completed his studies at the Royal Academy in Brussels during the Great War. \u201cHe had a traditional art education, he was taught the traditional subjects and techniques of European painting,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cBut he was always looking for something more experimental as an artist \u2026 and Brussels was not Paris, which was a real hotbed of experimentation in the 1920s.\u201d After his debut solo exhibition shocked Brussels society and received poor reviews, Magritte moved to Paris in 1927. The Meaning of Night 1927 The Meaning of Night is considered one of the most important paintings demonstrating Magritte\u2019s transition to surrealism. \u201cHe has really declared quite stridently his allegiance to the burgeoning surrealist movement,\u201d says Chambers, a movement that had only been established three years earlier with Andr\u00e9 Breton\u2019s Surrealist Manifesto of 1924. The Philosophical Lamp 1936 This is one of a surprisingly small number of paintings by Magritte that are considered self portraits. \u201cWe find this subversive, irreverent sense of humour, where the nose sort of morphs into another organ of the body altogether and plugs into a pipe,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cSo already at this point in the 30s \u2013 and we see this more and more in the 1960s \u2013 there\u2019s this kind of self reference that\u2019s going on within his work, that\u2019s done with a real sense of self-referential humour.\u201d Painted in the mid-1930s, the pipe had already become one of the artist\u2019s most pervasive motifs. A Stroke of Luck 1945 Magritte\u2019s so-called Renoir period, where he painted in the impressionist style of Pierre-Auguste Renoir, only lasted two years. It was a dramatic departure in style for the artist, brought on by the outbreak of the second world war. In A Stroke of Luck, a comically suited sardonic looking pig peers back at the viewer, but in the background a cenotaph commemorating the war dead softly looms. \u201cHe felt that surrealism couldn\u2019t continue in the form that it had been in previous decades, that the war had presented very real philosophical challenges to artists,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cHe wanted to dispense with what he thought of as the dark visions that surrealism had been depicting in the earlier decades and instead depict a kind of lighter and perhaps brighter side of life \u2013 he actually referred to it as \u2018pleasure humour\u2019.\u201d Golconda 1953 One of the most iconic images of Magritte\u2019s entire oeuvre is the bowler-hatted man, and in the 1953 work Golconda we see a field of bowler-hatted men floating in the sky against the backdrop of a bland Brussels apartment block. \u201cMagritte increasingly returns to this figure in numerous different configurations and compositions over the decades. The bowler-hatted man represents a kind of everyman,\u201d says Chambers. By the 1960s however, the figure of the bowler-hatted man had become associated with Magritte himself. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting turn and one Magritte quite strategically embraces.\u201d The Dominion of Light 1954 Magritte painted more than 20 different versions of The Dominion of Light, a house by a lake illuminated with a gas light under a cloudy blue sky yet seemingly captured in the depth of night. \u201cIt\u2019s a composition that brings together two completely antithetical times of day or states of light, so it\u2019s a very strange image when you first look at it,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cThere\u2019s just something so uncanny about it and it\u2019s hard to make sense of where the strangeness comes from. It looks perhaps like an image of the dusk, but the more time that you spend with the painting, you realise that the top half of the picture in fact represents the intense light of say 2pm on a summer\u2019s day, whereas the bottom half of the painting is the deep of night. It\u2019s 2am, and somehow, quite magically, Magritte has brought together these two quite opposite states of light within the one painting.\u201d If the viewer has never set eyes on The Dominion of Light before, yet it still feels vaguely familiar, that could be because the iconic poster for the supernatural horror classic The Exorcist was purportedly inspired by this Magritte work. It is one of dozens of the artist\u2019s works that have been appropriated by popular culture since his surge in popularity from the 1960s onwards. The Apple logo for The Beatles\u2019 record company was inspired by Magritte\u2019s Le Jeu de Mourre, and multiple images of the artist\u2019s work are reproduced in the 1992 animation film Toys. Magritte\u2019s painting The Son of Man plays a central role in the 1999 heist film The Thomas Crown Affair, the artist has inspired the writings of John Berger, LJ Smith and Tom Stoppard, and Paul Simon and John Cale have even sung about him. Magritte is on at the Art Gallery of New South Wales until 9 February 2025.",

They gave Forest plenty to think about in the first half, but didn\u2019t show up at all for the second.

All of their goals were taken magnificently \u2026 and though Leicester were also defensively at fault for all three, let\u2019s take nothing away from a splendid all-round Forest performance. Chris Wood correctly named player of the match, though Elliot Anderson, Callum Hudson-Odoi and captain Ryan Yates should also be mentioned in dispatches. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side celebrate as they go fifth in the Premier League, for an evening at least. The Foxes remain in 14th spot, their two-match winning run coming to an end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\"

      "bodyText": "Ben Fisher was at the King Power, and here\u2019s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night. Steve Cooper, not quite so perky, gives Sky his verdict. \u201cIt\u2019s self-inflicted \u2026 it\u2019s on us \u2026 we all have to take responsibility \u2026 we made some poor mistakes on the goals \u2026 the third goal was a real killer \u2026 it\u2019s a setback after winning a few games \u2026 we have to accept it \u2026 it\u2019s on me \u2026 we got punished for the poor giveaways \u2026 we gifted them moments \u2026 we feel we\u2019re on a good path but this is a setback \u2026 especially in the local rivalry \u2026 we really have to feel the hurt for the supporters and take it on the chin \u2026 we fell short \u2026 it\u2019s happened and we have to reflect on it \u2026 we have to be very determined to not let that happen again \u2026 there will be loads of ups and downs this season \u2026. that\u2019s the nature of the league and where we\u2019re at, trying to reestablish again in the Premier League and it ain\u2019t easy \u2026 the last two games were highs \u2026 today was a low \u2026 how we recover will define where we\u2019ll end up \u2026 we\u2019re motivated and determined to put it right.\u201d Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, smiling warmly, speaks to Sky. \u201cIt was a good game \u2026 very stable \u2026 confident \u2026 solid \u2026 a lot of talent in front \u2026 organisation was good \u2026 delighted \u2026 it is not about the table \u2026 what is more important is to see our fans enjoy and celebrate \u2026 they deserve \u2026 the table is not important \u2026 it is how we progress \u2026 this is what we expect \u2026 last season was a tough season but it is in the past \u2026 now we start a new cycle \u2026 the players are really committed \u2026 the bond we have is better \u2026 it is an amazing job from Chris Wood \u2026 it is not just the goals \u2026 the hard work \u2026 the voice in the dressing room \u2026 he deserves this moment \u2026 we want to play good football \u2026 we want to make our fans enjoy \u2026 we have to make it stronger to build on \u2026 we have to prepare for West Ham, it will be tough!\u201d Chris Wood \u2013 who now has seven Premier League goals to his name this season, only Erling Haaland (10) has more \u2013 speaks to Sky Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s a very nice start both for myself and the team \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be anything without my team-mates \u2026 I\u2019m not one that can take on four players and put it in the top corner \u2026 I rely on the service from my team-mates and they\u2019re delivering, which is great \u2026 it\u2019s fantastic \u2026 it\u2019s all about accumulating as many points as possible, as soon as possible \u2026 the confidence of keeping clean sheets helps so much \u2026 consistency is the biggest thing \u2026 we want to try to bring strikers back or I\u2019ll be out of a job! \u2026 it kind of went out of fashion but Erling has brought it back \u2026 it makes it easier for us number nines! \u2026 I just want to keep scoring as many as I can \u2026 Haaland is a big man to chase!\u201d Leicester cop for a smattering of boos as the final whistle goes. Some local-derby frustration there. They gave Forest plenty to think about in the first half, but didn\u2019t show up at all for the second. Forest by contrast were excellent in both halves, and thoroughly deserved an ultimately comfortable victory. All of their goals were taken magnificently \u2026 and though Leicester were also defensively at fault for all three, let\u2019s take nothing away from a splendid all-round Forest performance. Chris Wood correctly named player of the match, though Elliot Anderson, Callum Hudson-Odoi and captain Ryan Yates should also be mentioned in dispatches. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side celebrate as they go fifth in the Premier League, for an evening at least. The Foxes remain in 14th spot, their two-match winning run coming to an end. Forest are deserving winners of this big East Midlands showdown! 90 min +5: Milenkovic is booked for telling it as he sees it to the referee \u2026 after his own side won a clock-draining free-kick. A completely pointless booking at this stage. 90 min +3: Aina skittles Justin 25 yards from goal, just to the left of the Forest box. Leicester load the mixer, and Buonanotte sends the free kick in. But it\u2019s easily cleared by Forest, and Soumare is booked for cynically bringing down Awoniyi, who was about to send the visitors away on the counter. 90 min +1: The first of those additional minutes sees Awoniyi lash a shot into the side netting, and mascot-infused patter merchant Jamie Carragher name Chris Wood as the player of the match. 90 min: There will be seven added minutes. 89 min: Ayew is booked for a frustrated clatter into Silva. The resulting free kick is sent in from the right by Sosa, and Yates crashes a header off the right-hand post. He\u2019s flagged offside, correctly so, though in a parallel universe, the Forest defender is now celebrating a hat-trick. The small margins here and there. 88 min: The Forest fans are serenading their former boss Steve Cooper. The verb serenade doing quite a lot of heavy lifting there. 86 min: Fatawu hooks a cross in from the right. Easy for Sels, who has had nothing to do since the break. In fact, according to Sky, Leicester\u2019s only effort on target this evening has been Vardy\u2019s goal. Thing is, they looked pretty good in attack during the first half. Just not enough threat at the sharp end. 85 min: \u2026 apart from the ball, that is. Okoli\u2019s poor pass out from the back allows Sosa a shy at goal. He drags it wide left. 84 min: Forest are seeing this game out confidently. Leicester are offering nowt. 82 min: Faes heads a Forest free kick behind for a corner. The set piece is eventually worked back to Sosa, who skies a dismal long-distance effort deep into the stand. 81 min: \u2026 so there\u2019ll be no hat-trick for Wood, because the two-goal striker is hooked for Awoniyi. The big man has been brilliant this evening. 80 min: Williams hares down the left after a long ball. A first-time delivery into the centre would tee up Wood for his hat-trick, but Williams strangely opts to check back instead and the attack peters out. 78 min: Dominguez is booked for a lazy clip on Soumare\u2019s ankle. 77 min: Sosa\u2019s first act is to nearly dribble clear down the inside-left channel. Forest look more likely to score a fourth than Leicester do to reduce their arrears. 76 min: Another double Forest change. Hudson-Odoi and Elanga make way for Silva and Sosa. 74 min: The corner leads to a game of head tennis. Forest are under a bit of pressure, but Faes clumsily clatters into Dominguez, and the whistle provides relief for the visitors. Faes using up a lot of moral credit in this second half. 73 min: Justin sprays a fine diagonal pass towards Fatawu on the right touchline. Fatawu wins a corner. Winks to send it in. 71 min: Forest respond to Leicester\u2019s double change with one of their own, replacing Anderson and Moreno with Williams and Morato. 69 min: A huge chance to wrap things up once and for all for Forest. A corner sent in from the right. Leicester fail to deal with it, and the ball drops to Yates six yards out. He simply has to score, but somehow blazes over the bar. That\u2019s an astonishing miss. 68 min: Ayew and El Khannouss replace Mavididi and Pereira for Leicester. 67 min: Leicester need something quickly, and Buonanotte does his bit by winning a corner down the left. Fatawu to send it in. It\u2019s hit long. Buonanotte heads it back across goal but only into the arms of Sels, who hasn\u2019t had much to do since the restart. 66 min: Chris Wood now has seven Premier League goals to his name this season. Only Erling Haaland, with ten, has more. 64 min: Leicester were the better team in the first half as well. But it\u2019s Forest who have been miles better since the restart, and by far the more clinical. Adding injury to insult, Buonanotte takes a flailing hand in the face from Yates. 62 min: Faes always has a mistake in him, and that one\u2019s really hurt Leicester, this match having suddenly got away from them. The away fans now completely freed from desire. It\u2019s Wood again, and this one is straight from the 80s. Sels launches long down the middle. It\u2019s Faes versus Wood on the chase. Faes heads weakly back towards his keeper, with Hermansen in no-man\u2019s land. Wood heads the dropping ball over the keeper and into the unguarded net. Yet another defensive nightmare from Leicester\u2019s point of view; yet another fine finish by Wood! 58 min: Aina advances down the right again \u2026 and once more is dragged back by a cynical hand. It\u2019s Winks this time, and he goes into the book. 57 min: The Forest fans are currently in party mode. You know soccer\u2019s song du jour by now. 56 min: \u2026 and to illustrate that, Hudson-Odoi advances quickly down the inside-left channel, opens his body, and creams a curling sidefooter around Hermansen and off the base of the right-hand post. Anderson sends the rebound inches wide left. Leicester are suddenly holding on a bit here. 55 min: Aina crosses from the right. The ball drops at the feet of Anderson, who pearls a shot goalwards from the edge of the box \u2026 but it\u2019s blocked and cleared. Forest come again, though, Hudson-Odoi crossing long from the left. Elanga only just misses out at the far stick. Forest are looking dangerous every time they attack. 53 min: Buonanotte and Anderson both go down in an accidental collision. Thankfully both get back up after a fashion. We play on. 51 min: There was a small tug on Vardy, it\u2019s true, but the striker got his feet in a tangle before going over, and that was never going to be awarded. Buonanotte blasts over from distance in frustration. 50 min: Mavididi pings a pass down the inside-left channel in the hope of releasing Vardy into the box. It\u2019s a bit overhit and Sels claims, though Vardy goes over, claiming to have been clipped by Milenkovic. He wants a penalty, but the ref\u2019s not interested, and neither is VAR. 49 min: That was an absolute belter by Wood. It was never going to end 1-1. This is such a simple goal from Forest\u2019s point of view. Anderson picks up possession on the left and rolls infield for Wood, who has his back to goal on the penalty spot. Wood spins and dispatches a glorious shot into the bottom right. A delightful finish! But another possession cock-up on the part of Leicester, with Winks and Fatawu confusing each other to allow Forest to begin their attack. 46 min: Mavididi is booked for a cynical tug on the in-flight Aina\u2019s shirt. Leicester get the second half started. No changes. Half-time entertainment. Having mentioned former Leicester and Forest boss Matt Gillies in the preamble, I\u2019d be doing you a disservice if I didn\u2019t remind you of this typically lovely piece from our old pal Rob Bagchi. Enjoy, enjoy. Leicester have been the better side, but that\u2019s not to talk Forest down. Both teams have shown plenty of attacking ambition and it\u2019s been an entertaining end-to-end game. More please! 45 min +2: Mavididi cuts in from the left and bends one towards the bottom-right corner. Just wide, though Sels had it covered. 45 min +1: Buonanotte bombs down the middle and dinks a pass wide right for Vardy, whose cutback finds Fatawu, on the edge of the box. Fatawu can\u2019t get the ball under control for a shot. Shame, because that was a fine flowing move. 45 min: There will be two additional first-half minutes. 44 min: Buonanotte jinks his way down the left and cuts back for Mavididi, who can\u2019t turn the ball goalwards. Another attractive attack. 43 min: Mavididi tries to release Vardy down the inside left with a cute twirl and backflick. Not quite, but full marks for artistic ambition. 41 min: Moreno is booked for clattering Fatawu out on the right wing. Winks tries to wedge the free kick towards Vardy in the box, but his accuracy is way off this time. 40 min: Winks hits the corner long from the left. Sels comes off his line; he flaps and misses. Faes mistimes his effort to head the ball at the far stick; it comes off his back and then off Aina, but Leicester don\u2019t get another corner. Probably best that everyone forgets all about this, players, officials, the lot. We\u2019ll say no more about it. 39 min: Buonanotte finds some space down the inside-right channel but can\u2019t find anyone with his cutback. Forest fail to clear their lines properly, and Fatawu is able to try again from the same flank. His deep cross is steered out at the far post by Moreno for a corner. 37 min: Nothing comes of the corner. \u201cA very open and attractive game, this, with both sides looking to attack (for now at least),\u201d notes Michael Cosgrove. \u201cAdd to that the classic blue vs red shirts against a well-kept green pitch and I\u2019m a happy little bunny.\u201d 36 min: Elanga witlessly bashes the free kick straight into the wall. But the rebound\u2019s worked back to Hudson-Odoi, who pearls a shot towards the right-hand side of goal. Shades of his winner at Anfield. But Hermansen is behind it all the way and turns it around the post. 35 min: Elanga bursts down the middle with plenty of space in front of him. He\u2019s got an opportunity to send Hudson-Odoi clear to his left, but overcooks the pass, and the ball clanks out for a goal kick. But Pereira had also clipped Elanga from behind, and Forest get the free kick, 25 yards out in a central position. Dangerous. Pereira goes into the book, too. 33 min: Faes floats a long pass down the inside-left channel. Ndidi telescopes a leg in the hope of bringing the ball out of the sky. He can\u2019t connect, and the ball sails out for a goal kick. But had Ndidi managed to complete his task \u2013 and he wasn\u2019t far away from doing so \u2013 he\u2019d have had a free whack from just inside the box. None too easy, and it would have been a peach of a goal, to be fair. Ndidi raises his arm in acknowledgement. 31 min: Elanga and Anderson both make their presence felt down the Forest right. Both take a whack at goal; the former\u2019s effort is blocked, the latter\u2019s loops harmlessly wide and high. 30 min: Anderson tries a curler towards the top-right corner from the edge of the Leicester box. Blocked. This surely isn\u2019t going to end 1-1. This won\u2019t end 1-1. 28 min: Elanga drives hard down the right and hits a low shot-cum-cross that Hermansen diverts clear with a strong arm. Leicester immediately counter, and Buonanotte releases Fatawu into space down the right. Fatawu has Buonanotte and Vardy in the middle, but misreads the situation completely and plays a pass down the inside-right channel to nobody whatsoever. Sels claims. This is breathless. 27 min: Winks looks for the top-right corner from distance. The shot\u2019s not a patch on his work for the equaliser. Goal kick. 26 min: How on earth did that stay out? This is great fun. 25 min: \u2026 the ball drops to Murillo, ten yards out. He attempts to prod through a crowded box. The ball breaks right to Dominguez, free on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. He must score \u2026 and he shoots hard \u2026 but Hermansen spreads himself, star-jumping Peter Schmeichel style, to make a sensational stop with his right leg! 24 min: Now it\u2019s Forest\u2019s turn to respond to a setback, and Elanga and Aina combine down the right to win a corner. And from that \u2026 It hasn\u2019t taken long for the hosts to fashion an equaliser! Winks drives down the inside-left channel. He slips a pass wide left to Mavididi, who returns it down the channel. Winks whips a low cross into the mixer. Vardy sticks out a leg and guides the ball past Sels. Lovely finish, but what an assist by Winks! 21 min: If this game were to end now, Forest would go fifth, for one night at least. With this prize in mind, Forest attempt to double their lead, Hudson-Odoi raking a pass down the left for Elanga to chase after. With the hosts light at the back, Elanga crosses deep \u2026 but Wood has come towards the near post. Chance gone. 20 min: Fatawu wins a corner down the right. Buonanotte, desperate to atone, swings the set piece in, but Forest deal with this one easily enough. 18 min: Three of the most abysmal attempted clearances in short order, there, and my how Leicester have paid the price for them. Pereira, Buonanotte and Justin need to have a long, hard think about what they\u2019ve just done. Buonanotte has been impressive in attack \u2026 but now he scuffs a clearance. Anderson tries to make space for a shot. His effort is blocked, and then it\u2019s Justin\u2019s turn to almost completely miss his clearance. This is farcical, and the hosts pay, with Yates picking up possession, 25 yards out, and passing a confident shot into the bottom left. Hermansen no chance! 15 min: Pereira almost completely whiffs a simple clearance, allowing Forest to go on the attack. Aina crosses from the right. Elanga can\u2019t win a header \u2026 but he wins a corner soon after. And from that \u2026 14 min: The Foxes are enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession so far, though they\u2019ve yet to work Sels in the Forest goal. Buonanotte still buzzing around everywhere. 12 min: Buonanotte is pulling all the strings for Leicester, prompting from the centre. The ball\u2019s slipped wide left to Vardy; he crosses for Ndidi, who heads harmlessly over. The roles might have been better reversed there. 10 min: Buonanotte takes it himself and swings it into the six-yard mixer. There\u2019s some pinball before Forest eventually clear their lines. 9 min: Some more space for Buonanotte down the middle. He dribbles hard at the Forest back line before reaching the right-hand edge of the D and shooting. His effort is deflected wide right for Leicester\u2019s first corner. 8 min: Hudson-Odoi is making a proper nuisance of himself on the left flank. His sheer presence is causing Leicester mild angst. Forest are repeatedly looking to find him. 6 min: Elanga swings it in. Milenkovic is shoved over before the ball arrives, and wants a penalty, but the referee shows no interest whatsoever. Milenkovic has a face on. 5 min: Moreno and Hudson-Odoi one-two their way down the left, the former winning the first corner of the evening. Elanga to take. 4 min: Mavididi tries to release Winks down the left but Milenkovic spots the danger and comes across to usher the ball out for a goal kick. 2 min: Another clipping, this time by Fatawu on Hudson-Odoi out on the Forest left. A free kick, and it\u2019s swung in by Elanga to no effect whatsoever. Both teams showing early signs of wanting to get forward, though. 1 min: Buonanotte immediately starts dribbling down the middle and he\u2019s suspiciously clipped from behind by Dominguez. With seconds on the clock, the referee waves play on, because with Buonanotte kind of going nowhere, a big decision to book someone so soon doesn\u2019t seem worth it. A knee of love and equality is taken \u2026 there\u2019s no room for racism \u2026 then Forest get the ball rolling. Here we go! The teams are out. Leicester in blue, Forest in red. This Sunday will be the sixth anniversary of the passing of beloved former Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who has been remembered on the big screen. His seat in the directors\u2019 box will be symbolically draped with a scarf. Additionally, with Remembrance Day upcoming, there\u2019s also a poignant rendition of the Last Post. RIP the fallen. No pre-match managerial interviews this evening on Sky Sports. It doesn\u2019t feel as though we\u2019ve lost much, though, right? The programme\u2019s been on since 7pm, though, with its centrepiece a race between Leicester mascot Filbert Fox and its Forest counterpart Robin Hood, played this evening by Jamie Carragher. \u201cHe\u2019s taken banter too far this time,\u201d observes my wise colleague and picture guru John Windmill. A reminder that this is pay-TV that costs viewers cash money. Also that ITV had the famous 1989 title decider between Liverpool and Arsenal up and running from ident to kick-off within 13 minutes. Things move on, if not necessarily forward. Leicester make three changes to their starting XI in the wake of their dramatic 3-2 comeback victory at Southampton last Saturday. Bilal El Khannouss and Oliver Skipp drop to the bench, while Victor Kristiansen is injured. Ricardo Pereira, Harry Winks and Abdul Fatawu step up. Forest follow up their 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Monday night by making the sum total of zero changes. If it ain\u2019t broke, etc. James Ward-Prowse returns from suspension and takes up a place on the bench, but Morgan Gibbs-White remains injured. Leicester City: Hermansen, Justin, Faes, Okoli, Pereira, Ndidi, Winks, Fatawu, Buonanotte, Mavididi, Vardy. Subs: Ward, Coady, El Khannous, De Cordova-Reid, Ayew, Skipp, Soumare, Edouard, Thomas. Nottingham Forest: Sels, Aina, Milenkovic, Murillo, Alex, Yates, Dominguez, Elanga, Anderson, Hudson-Odoi, Wood. Subs: Carlos Miguel, Morato, Williams, Awoniyi, Toffolo, Ward-Prowse, Silva, Sosa, Boly. Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire). Welcome to our coverage of the Matt Gillies derby. One for the heads there. Steve Cooper\u2019s breaking no new ground by flitting up and down the A46, you see; we could also go with Dave Bassett, Micky Adams, Gary Megson or Martin O\u2019Neill if you\u2019d prefer. Kick-off is at 8pm BST. It\u2019s on!",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola is confident that, should he depart next summer, Manchester City will not falter as Manchester United did when Sir Alex Ferguson left in May 2013. Guardiola will decide this winter whether to extend his contract into a 10th year, Txiki Begiristain having confirmed he will leave as City\u2019s sporting director at the end of the season. Ferguson left United as champions but they have failed to be serious title contenders since. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened [at United],\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI am pretty sure that [stability] is going to happen [here]. I know how it works. It will be a bad sign for the club if after just one person leaves everything is dragged down. It [stability] is going to happen, for sure. Maybe they [the executive] will make mistakes, but during the mistakes they will solve it. Immediately, that is for sure. The guys know exactly what they have to do. \u201cWhen it is going bad they will find the solutions immediately. They will be patient, calm and know what they have to do. Absolutely, I don\u2019t have doubts about that. With Txiki for 12 years and in my case, it is normal that it looks like we cannot leave, but of course we can move on. Life moves on.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Thank you for tuning in to this live blog. Suzanne Wrack has just filed her report on this crazy game. Read it below. Germany end this hectic match as deserved winners. For all England\u2019s chances, they never really looked settled, and were repeatedly overrun in the middle of the park. Germany dominated the second half and will be disappointed that they didn\u2019t score more. England will take some solace in the fact that only one goal separated the sides. Despite not being at their best, they managed to stay in the game. If there\u2019s a time to make mistakes, it\u2019s now. It\u2019s a friendly after all. 90 min +1: Second half substitute Jessica Naz does excellently to draw a foul. First, she wins the an aerial duel before changing her pace to get past the defender who can only bring her down illegally. 90 min: There will be six more minutes of this game. Can England find an equaliser? 88 min: It\u2019s too easy. One long ball and Endemann is through. Determined not to let the Wolfsburg player get the best of her twice, Jess Carter makes a fantastic recovery run and tackle. 86 min: Somehow England survive. Vivien Endemann spins Jess Carter on England\u2019s left and the forward whips a ball into the near post. Cerci gets there first but she miscues the volley and the ball goes wide. England are back in it again! A fairly routine free kick turns calamitous for Ann-Katrin Berger. The keeper comes out to claim the delivery but she spills the ball and it falls straight to Lucy Bronze in the box. The defender can\u2019t believe her luck and she smashes the ball into the back of the net. 76 min: Goal for England? No, that\u2019s another one ruled out for offside. Lauren Hemp went too early but her finish was excellent. The in form forward cut in on the left and smashed the ball into the top right. Sara D\u00e4britz steps up and puts her penalty away with ease. While the penalty decision looked harsh, a goal is no less than Germany have deserved in this second half. England fail to deal with a free kick. First Hannah Hampton spills the initial cross, then England fail to clear it and finally Russo concedes a penalty for kicking the player rather the ball. The penalty looked very soft. 68 min: For all of England\u2019s midfield talent, they\u2019ve struggled to gain a foothold in this game. The gaps in midfield have repeatedly left England\u2019s defenders exposed. 63 min: England are hanging on. This time Alex Greenwood, on for Williamson, gives the ball away. Pia-Sophie Wolter receives the ball and has an effort on goal. England need to wake up. 61 min: England give the ball away again. This time B\u00fchl takes a shot but she drags it well wide of the left post. 58 min: Massive chance for Brand! Park tries to pass the ball back to Millie Bright but they\u2019re not on the same wavelength. Brand charges through the heart of the England defence and shoots towards Hampton\u2019s left. It\u2019s not far enough in the corner though and it\u2019s an easy save for the keeper. 55 min: The second half has understandably started slower than the first. The intensity and chaos of the first 45 minutes was unsustainable for a full game. 50 min: Germany put the ball into the back of the net again but Cerci has strayed offside. Germany pick England apart again, playing a couple of short passes together before releasing Dallmann in the box. She crosses the ball in for Jule Brand to tap in. The offside flag is up though. 45 min: We\u2019re back underway. Jess Park is on for Ella Toone. Sarai Linder and Giovanna Hoffmann are on for Felicitas Rauch and Selina Cerci respectively. And breathe. What a half of football that was. Who needs defenders when you can enjoy games like this without them? Germany got off to a dream start, taking an early 3-0 lead. But England were given a lifeline with a contentious penalty. Both sides have had a glut of chances but Germany have edged it. 3-2 is probably a fair scoreline. 45 min +4: Oh my word! Germany win the ball in the middle of the park and a header falls to the feet of Linda Dallmann. The midfielder lifts her head up and from about 40 yards out, lets fly with a tremendous effort. A back peddling Hampton has to do everything in her power to tip the ball onto the bar. 45 min +1: Germany are running through England again. Sarai Linder is the latest player to have ago as she drills a left footed attempt towards Hannah Hampton\u2019s right post. The Chelsea goalkeeper gets down well and tips the ball round the post. 45 min: There will be five minutes added on to this crazy first half. 38 min: Earlier I was wondering if the attacking play was great or the defending was poor. It\u2019s definitely the latter. Sara Doorsoun dawdles on the ball after receiving it from the keeper. Her pocket is rightly picked and Toone collects the ball about 30 yards from goal. With the Germany defence parted like the Red Sea, Toone looks destined to score as she races towards the box. But the Manchester United midfielder places it agonisingly wide of the right post. The look on Wiegman\u2019s face says it all. England are right back in it! Russo takes charge in the middle of the park and spreads the play out wide to Beth Mead. Mead flies forward down the right and unselfishly squares the ball to Georgia Stanway in the box. The midfielder makes no mistake and slaps the ball into the top right. The Bayern Munich midfielder Georgia Stanway steps up and hits a perfect penalty into the bottom left corner. Is this the start of a comeback? 32 min: A lifeline for England. Lauren Hemp makes her way to the byline and whips a cross towards the six yard box. Her delivery is deflected however as it hits Gwinn\u2019s hand. The referee doesn\u2019t give a penalty at first but it\u2019s going to be checked \u2026 penalty given! England are being run ragged. Germany win the ball back deep in their own half and within a flash they\u2019re on the counter attack. One, two, three passes and the ball is with Klara B\u00fchl on the left wing. The Bayern Munich forward cuts in on her right foot and smashes the ball past Hampton at the near post. The keeper will be disappointed with that one. 24 min: Another heart in mouth moment for England. Millie Bright plays a relatively routine back pass to Hampton but the keeper slips and makes a last ditch challenge to clear the ball away. 22 min: I\u2019m not sure if the attacking play has been great or the defending has been poor. Either way, this has been a thoroughly entertaining game. 18 min: England have another chance as the ball falls to Alessia Russo again. Beth Mead starts the attack by picking the pocket of Sarai Linder before crossing the ball in to find her Arsenal teammate. Russo gets her head on it but it\u2019s deflected and the ball trickles past the post. 15 min: Jess Carter is being stretched on England\u2019s left hand side. Germany repeatedly switch the ball to their right to find Gwinn. Having already scored two, she\u2019s full of confidence and seems to have the beating of the defender. 12 min: I can barely keep up! Russo, still ruing that disallowed goal, picks up the ball on the right wing. She drives into the box and smashes the ball onto the post. What a frantic game! Almost immediately after England have a goal disallowed, Germany go down the other end. The goalscorer Giulia Gwinn finds herself in space on the edge of the box and she dribbles at Jess Carter before drilling the ball past Hannah Hampton for her second. 9 min: Is that an equaliser? No. The ball is played over the top to Ella Toone who makes a great run from deep. She lays the ball off to Alessia Russo and the Arsenal forward smashes the ball into the top left corner. The offside flag is up though. Toone went a fraction too early. I\u2019ve barely had a moment to catch my breath! Giulia Gwinn steps up to take the penalty and dispatches the ball emphatically into the bottom left corner. England have conceded before many of the fans at Wembley have had a chance to settle into their seats. 2 min: Penalty for Germany! Leah Williamson gives the ball away sloppily and in a blink Millie Bright fouls Linda Dallmann to give away a penalty. Here we go. Germany get the ball rolling, kicking from left to right. The players are making their way onto the field. England are led out by Steph Houghton whose incredible career for the Lionesses is being commemorated today. Hannah Hampton continues to keep Mary Earps out of the starting line up. Here\u2019s what Sarina Wiegman had to say about her decision. ITV have agreed a new four-year record deal with The FA as they will continue to be the home of the Lionesses from 2025-2029. The deal will see the broadcaster show all of the England senior women\u2019s teams qualifying fixtures for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2027 and UEFA Women\u2019s EURO 2029, as well as the team\u2019s UEFA Women\u2019s Nations League campaigns and all international friendlies. All games will continue to be free-to-air, with a commitment for more than half of the matches each season shown on ITV1 with the remainder available on ITV4 and ITVX. The existing four-year deal [2021-2025] draws to a close at the end of the 2024-25 season. ITV also recently signed a deal for live coverage of the UEFA Women\u2019s EURO 2025 alongside the BBC, with every match broadcast in the UK on either ITV or the BBC, except for the final, which will be shown by both broadcasters. Speaking about England\u2019s progress after EURO 2022, Sarina Wiegman said: \u201cWe always want to [progress] faster but I think the game has increased, the level of the leagues in international football has increased and developed.\u201d England: Hampton, Bronze, Carter, Walsh, Bright, Williamson, Mead, Stanway, Russo, Toone, Hemp Subs: Le Tissier, Earps, Park, Morgan, Greenwood, Beever-Jones, Clinton, Kelly, Naz, Moorhouse, Parker Germany: Berger, Linder, Minge, N\u00fcsken, Gwinn, Dallmann, B\u00fchl, Sen\u00df, Brand, Doorsoun, Hoffmann Subs: Anyomi, Cerci, D\u00e4britz, Endemann, Gr\u00e4we, Johannes, Kleinherne, Lohmann, Rauch, Winkler, Wolter A crowd of about 50,000-55,000 is expected, down significantly on the 87,192 at 2022\u2019s final. But Wiegman and Williamson played down any concerns of a drop-off in support. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a real negative,\u201d Wiegman said. \u201cIt\u2019s really positive that over the next two windows we play at Wembley twice, with over 100,000 fans coming to the stadium. Yes, of course, Wembley can have more people there. But we\u2019re thinking big.\u201d Not sure of what to expect from the match tonight. Don\u2019t worry, Tom Garry\u2019s got you covered. Read his article below: Hello and welcome to this women\u2019s international friendly live blog. England play Germany at Wembley in a repeat of the EURO 2022 final. In the 818 days since the Lionesses won the Euros, Sarina Wiegman\u2019s side reached a World Cup final, missed out on Olympic qualification by way of Team GB and initially struggled in their EURO 2025 Qualifiers. Meanwhile, Germany crashed out of the 2023 World Cup during the group stages, appointed a new manager in Christian W\u00fcck and topped their group on the road to EURO 2025. This friendly will be a chance for both teams to see where they\u2019re at as they prepare for next summer. Email me to have your say. Kick off is at 7:30pm.",

      "body": "<p>Happy Saturday, readers! There\u2019s less than a fortnight to go until the US\u2019s political fate is decided (for our coverage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">see here</a>). But there are plenty of other things going on in the world \u2013 today, read about the secrets of brains and what it\u2019s like living in Kanye West\u2019s abandoned mansion.</p> <p>I saved my favourite for the end.</p> <h2>1. The Faustian pact between stars and the public</h2>    <p>The death of Liam Payne has prompted worldwide tributes for the former One Direction member, but it has also sparked something of a reckoning about celebrity culture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/22/liam-payne-death-celebrity-fame\">This piece</a> by crisis PR consultant and author Mark Borkowski urges us to treat celebrities like humans and not gods \u2013 and points out that while stars may think they understand the demands of public life, many don\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cCelebrity in 2024 is like stepping into a spotlight that continues to follow you when you leave the stage,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd, believe me, there\u2019s no line this invasive spotlight won\u2019t cross. Once you\u2019re in it, the media and public don\u2019t easily respect boundaries. They view public figures as akin to public property, commodities whose personal lives are of as much interest as their professional output.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Three minutes.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Liam Payne was just getting started\u2019:</strong> In the hours after his death, Alexis Petridis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/17/after-one-direction-liam-payne-was-just-getting-started-his-death-is-a-heartbreaking-end\">penned a beautiful piece</a> on Payne. And regardless of whether you fell in love with One Direction at 13, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/18/boybands-liam-payne-one-direction\">Kate Solomon\u2019s tribute</a> is worth your time.</p> <h2>2. On sleeping with older men</h2>    <p>The first man Daniel fell for was his humanities teacher \u2013 a straight, married man who was 37 when Daniel was born. \u201cThis entirely unrequited crush (which I never admitted to anyone until I was well into adulthood) planted the germ of who I became,\u201d Daniel writes in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/19/im-33-and-my-husband-is-77-this-is-why-our-relationship-works\">colourful chronicle of early sexuality</a>, during which he attempted \u201cto counter society\u2019s assumption\u201d that he was chasing older men \u201cbecause I wanted their money\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIntergenerational gay relationships are always scrutinised for being transactional,\u201d he writes. \u201cAcquisitive stereotypes cut both ways: the younger partner worries about seeming conniving, while the older partner fears being fed a line, as if his significant other is the dating equivalent of a phishing email. My commitment to self-sufficiency was not what allowed Jeff and I to transcend these preconceptions. It was the strength of our attachment, the reality that we fell in love.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Six minutes.</p> <p><strong>Further reading: </strong>Sticking to the theme of love, read this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/20/does-time-heal-i-dont-think-so-richard-e-grant-on-love-loss-and-bonking\">interview with actor Richard E Grant</a> who talks about heartbreak, ambition and grieving the loss of his wife.</p> <h2>3. Cracking the secrets of ancient brains</h2>    <p>The very idea of a 2,500-year-old brain is mind-blowing. How does a brain preserve itself? Why do some become \u201cshrunken, spongy or crumbly to touch\u201d, while others completely disintegrate and all that is left is the mighty secure skull?</p> <p>Alexandra Morton-Hayward has been busy studying \u201cthe molecular processes that occur after death to preserve brain tissue\u201d \u2013 or as we might say, brain preservation. What she and other experts have found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/22/ancient-brain-collector-alexandra-morton-hayward-heslington\">is groundbreaking and somewhat bleak</a> \u2013 \u201cmany preserved brains come from people whose lives ended miserably\u201d. The scientist\u2019s own story is an illuminating tale as to why people often pursue the work they do: she traces her fascination with the brain to a very specific time \u2013 when her own brain began to torture her.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Eleven minutes.</p> <p><strong>Another brainy read: </strong>The secrets of millions buried in the Paris catacombs \u2013 what killed them and what diseases they suffered from \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/bodies-quarry-shafts-millions-buried-paris-catacombs\">are finally coming to light.</a> \u201cAstonishing as it may seem, there has never been any serious scientific study of the catacombs,\u201d the forensic pathologist leading this project says.</p> <h2>4. Teacher-less pilates: \u2018There is a soothing quality to the digital instructor\u2019s voice\u2019</h2>    <p>As someone who tried reformer pilates, only to fail to activate my core and fall like a gasping fish to the ground, I am impressed by Michael Sun. He cringes about the last reformer class he attended \u2013 rescued by the instructor after his entire body caved into a gap \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/21/reformer-pilates-classes-no-teacher-australia\">now relishes in his first time at a \u201c45-minute virtual session</a> featuring pre-recorded demonstrations by a digital teacher\u201d. \u201cAn abhorrently cheerful voice radiates from a screen at the front of the room: \u2018You got this!\u2019\u201d he writes. \u201cI grunt in response.\u201d</p> <p>Suffice to say, this is a very fun read.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Three minutes.</p> <h2>5. John Safran\u2019s week of squatting in Ye\u2019s mansion</h2>    <p>What is it like to squat in Kanye West\u2019s house? Apparently not very fun, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/22/my-week-at-kanyes-john-safran-on-his-time-squatting-in-the-rappers-mansion\">according to John Safran</a>. The Jewish Australian comedian-journalist flew from Melbourne to LA to spontaneously slip inside the rapper\u2019s (abandoned and unlocked) Calabasas mansion and spend a week \u201ctrying to understand West\u2019s psyche\u201d. The result is unnerving.</p> <p>Guardian Australia\u2019s Sian Cain navigates the comedian\u2019s latest stunt, which he describes as a \u201cwriter\u2019s retreat\u201d (but what others would just call trespassing) \u2013 \u201csleeping in the rapper\u2019s bed and raiding the pantry\u201d \u2013 with great contextualisation and brilliant questions. It\u2019s one of my favourite interviews of the year.</p> <p><strong>Safran\u2019s reasoning</strong>: \u201cYou know, I blame society for me breaking into Kanye West\u2019s mansion,\u201d he tells Cain, faux-seriously. \u201cThe signs were there.

      "bodyText": "Happy Saturday, readers! There\u2019s less than a fortnight to go until the US\u2019s political fate is decided (for our coverage, see here). But there are plenty of other things going on in the world \u2013 today, read about the secrets of brains and what it\u2019s like living in Kanye West\u2019s abandoned mansion. I saved my favourite for the end. 1. The Faustian pact between stars and the public The death of Liam Payne has prompted worldwide tributes for the former One Direction member, but it has also sparked something of a reckoning about celebrity culture. This piece by crisis PR consultant and author Mark Borkowski urges us to treat celebrities like humans and not gods \u2013 and points out that while stars may think they understand the demands of public life, many don\u2019t. \u201cCelebrity in 2024 is like stepping into a spotlight that continues to follow you when you leave the stage,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd, believe me, there\u2019s no line this invasive spotlight won\u2019t cross. Once you\u2019re in it, the media and public don\u2019t easily respect boundaries. They view public figures as akin to public property, commodities whose personal lives are of as much interest as their professional output.\u201d How long will it take to read: Three minutes. \u2018Liam Payne was just getting started\u2019: In the hours after his death, Alexis Petridis penned a beautiful piece on Payne. And regardless of whether you fell in love with One Direction at 13, Kate Solomon\u2019s tribute is worth your time. 2. On sleeping with older men The first man Daniel fell for was his humanities teacher \u2013 a straight, married man who was 37 when Daniel was born. \u201cThis entirely unrequited crush (which I never admitted to anyone until I was well into adulthood) planted the germ of who I became,\u201d Daniel writes in this colourful chronicle of early sexuality, during which he attempted \u201cto counter society\u2019s assumption\u201d that he was chasing older men \u201cbecause I wanted their money\u201d. \u201cIntergenerational gay relationships are always scrutinised for being transactional,\u201d he writes. \u201cAcquisitive stereotypes cut both ways: the younger partner worries about seeming conniving, while the older partner fears being fed a line, as if his significant other is the dating equivalent of a phishing email. My commitment to self-sufficiency was not what allowed Jeff and I to transcend these preconceptions. It was the strength of our attachment, the reality that we fell in love.\u201d How long will it take to read: Six minutes. Further reading: Sticking to the theme of love, read this interview with actor Richard E Grant who talks about heartbreak, ambition and grieving the loss of his wife. 3. Cracking the secrets of ancient brains The very idea of a 2,500-year-old brain is mind-blowing. How does a brain preserve itself? Why do some become \u201cshrunken, spongy or crumbly to touch\u201d, while others completely disintegrate and all that is left is the mighty secure skull? Alexandra Morton-Hayward has been busy studying \u201cthe molecular processes that occur after death to preserve brain tissue\u201d \u2013 or as we might say, brain preservation. What she and other experts have found is groundbreaking and somewhat bleak \u2013 \u201cmany preserved brains come from people whose lives ended miserably\u201d. The scientist\u2019s own story is an illuminating tale as to why people often pursue the work they do: she traces her fascination with the brain to a very specific time \u2013 when her own brain began to torture her. How long will it take to read: Eleven minutes. Another brainy read: The secrets of millions buried in the Paris catacombs \u2013 what killed them and what diseases they suffered from \u2013 are finally coming to light. \u201cAstonishing as it may seem, there has never been any serious scientific study of the catacombs,\u201d the forensic pathologist leading this project says. 4. Teacher-less pilates: \u2018There is a soothing quality to the digital instructor\u2019s voice\u2019 As someone who tried reformer pilates, only to fail to activate my core and fall like a gasping fish to the ground, I am impressed by Michael Sun. He cringes about the last reformer class he attended \u2013 rescued by the instructor after his entire body caved into a gap \u2013 and now relishes in his first time at a \u201c45-minute virtual session featuring pre-recorded demonstrations by a digital teacher\u201d. \u201cAn abhorrently cheerful voice radiates from a screen at the front of the room: \u2018You got this!\u2019\u201d he writes. \u201cI grunt in response.\u201d Suffice to say, this is a very fun read. How long will it take to read: Three minutes. 5. John Safran\u2019s week of squatting in Ye\u2019s mansion What is it like to squat in Kanye West\u2019s house? Apparently not very fun, according to John Safran. The Jewish Australian comedian-journalist flew from Melbourne to LA to spontaneously slip inside the rapper\u2019s (abandoned and unlocked) Calabasas mansion and spend a week \u201ctrying to understand West\u2019s psyche\u201d. The result is unnerving. Guardian Australia\u2019s Sian Cain navigates the comedian\u2019s latest stunt, which he describes as a \u201cwriter\u2019s retreat\u201d (but what others would just call trespassing) \u2013 \u201csleeping in the rapper\u2019s bed and raiding the pantry\u201d \u2013 with great contextualisation and brilliant questions. It\u2019s one of my favourite interviews of the year. Safran\u2019s reasoning: \u201cYou know, I blame society for me breaking into Kanye West\u2019s mansion,\u201d he tells Cain, faux-seriously. \u201cThe signs were there. You could have stopped me.\u201d What does one eat in a vacated Kanye house? Some old pasta cooked in a bucket of rainwater. How long will it take to read: Four minutes.

Aggie Beever-Jones, Grace Clinton, Maya Le Tissier, Jess Park and Alex Greenwood were all missing from the starting lineup. Jess Carter was included at left-back, while the Euro 2022 winning centre-backs, Leah Williamson and Millie Bright, were reunited despite unconvincing recent performances for Arsenal and Chelsea respectively, and Ella Toone handed the No 10 shirt in the absence of the injured Lauren James. The only player to be given the nod over a more established counterpart was Hannah Hampton, who was preferred in goal to Mary Earps.</p> <p>The manager\u2019s decision to stick with players from the squad that earned a 2-1 win over Germany in the final of the last Euros, and seven starters in that final, despite the opportunity to test players in friendly fixtures for the first time in a long time, seemed staid.</p> <p>The trust had been placed in experience delivering at Wembley, but experience let them down almost instantly. Williamson\u2019s short pass was straight to Giovanna Hoffmann and the forward fed Linda Dallmann who was brought down by a recovering Bright. The Germany captain, Giulia Gwinn, converted from the spot, firing low into the corner to stun England on home turf.</p> <p>Wiegman\u2019s side had the ball in the back off the next shortly after, Alessia Russo latching on to Toone\u2019s backheel before firing in, but Toone had been offside in the buildup and a late flag quashed the celebrations.

      "bodyText": "Crises are not formed by results in friendlies, but England\u2019s shambolic defensive display, a conservative starting XI and the concession of three goals inside 30 minutes, in a 4-3 loss to Germany at Wembley, will certainly feel pretty bruising. The last time these two teams met on this stage, the spoils were far greater and the result very different, England securing an extra-time win over Germany courtesy of Chloe Kelly\u2019s famous goal to give England a first major trophy at the Euros in 2022. England have nine months until they begin their defence of that crown in Switzerland. Based on the performance against Germany, on the back of a not entirely straightforward European Championship qualifying campaign, Sarina Wiegman has a big job ahead of her if she is to restore England\u2019s solidity and fear factor. Germany arrived in London with a new manager, Christian W\u00fcck, and some significant absences, including Lena Oberdorf due to injury and Svenja Huth, Marina Hegering and Lina Magull all not in the squad for this international break. The surprise in England\u2019s starting XI was that there were no surprises, Wiegman choosing to go with tried and tested over players who are in form at club level. Aggie Beever-Jones, Grace Clinton, Maya Le Tissier, Jess Park and Alex Greenwood were all missing from the starting lineup. Jess Carter was included at left-back, while the Euro 2022 winning centre-backs, Leah Williamson and Millie Bright, were reunited despite unconvincing recent performances for Arsenal and Chelsea respectively, and Ella Toone handed the No 10 shirt in the absence of the injured Lauren James. The only player to be given the nod over a more established counterpart was Hannah Hampton, who was preferred in goal to Mary Earps. The manager\u2019s decision to stick with players from the squad that earned a 2-1 win over Germany in the final of the last Euros, and seven starters in that final, despite the opportunity to test players in friendly fixtures for the first time in a long time, seemed staid. The trust had been placed in experience delivering at Wembley, but experience let them down almost instantly. Williamson\u2019s short pass was straight to Giovanna Hoffmann and the forward fed Linda Dallmann who was brought down by a recovering Bright. The Germany captain, Giulia Gwinn, converted from the spot, firing low into the corner to stun England on home turf. Wiegman\u2019s side had the ball in the back off the next shortly after, Alessia Russo latching on to Toone\u2019s backheel before firing in, but Toone had been offside in the buildup and a late flag quashed the celebrations. They would be punished further immediately, Gwinn skating into acres of space on the right before striking past Hampton. It was a chastening first 11 minutes, and things only got worse for England, a swaggering counterattack leaving Klara B\u00fchl with the ball on the left and she rifled it past Hampton at her near post. It would be unfair to say Wiegman\u2019s side had been toothless up to this point, Russo had smashed the ball off the inside of the post between the second and third Germany goals, but they were being run ragged. Luck would finally tip their way within minutes of B\u00fchl\u2019s goal, a VAR review confirming the ball had grazed Gwinn\u2019s hand after Lauren Hemp sent in a cross from the left and England were handed a penalty of their own. Georgia Stanway swept the ball in from the spot and delivered it back to the centre circle, celebrations muted on the pitch but not in the stands. England reduced the deficit again, exposing the defensive frailties in the Germany backline, and Russo was at the heart of the buildup, playing the ball wide to Beth Mead who squared for Stanway to fire in. Having been poor for the third goal conceded, Hampton kept the margin to one with a fine fingertip save shortly before the break, pushing Dallmann\u2019s 40-yard effort on to the bar. The second half was a little less frenetic and more controlled but still end-to-end. England were spared further defensive humiliation by the linesman after Jule Brand slotted in with Selina Cerci having strayed offside in the buildup. Hoping to settle things, Wiegman reverted to the centre-back pairing that reached the World Cup final in Australia, while Williamson was out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, bringing off the Arsenal defender in favour of Greenwood on the hour in a planned move. There was controversy for Germany\u2019s fourth, Russo adjudged to have fouled Pia-Sophie Wolter with a high foot in the box, VAR not correcting the decision of the referee despite replays showing the forward had got the ball before Wolter\u2019s foot came into her. Sara D\u00e4britz scored the penalty to make England\u2019s job that much harder. There was time for one more England goal though, Hemp\u2019s free-kick, shortly after she had been denied herself by the offside flag, fumbled by the goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger, allowing Lucy Bronze to turn in. The deficit was narrowed, but this was the first time England had conceded four under Wiegman, and only the second time they had conceded more than two since the manager arrived in September 2021. The issues were obvious though, unforced errors and a failure to cope with the German press at the heart of the poor defensive display.

Between 1967 and 1990, Lesh appeared on all 13 of the Grateful Dead\u2019s studio releases and 10 official live albums.

He sat out the band\u2019s latest incarnation, Dead &amp; Company, fronted by John Mayer.</p> <p>Along with the other members of the Grateful Dead, Lesh was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. He is survived by his wife, Jill, and their sons, Grahame and Brian, both of whom performed with the Terrapin Family Band, Lesh\u2019s late-in-life band formed through his family-operated music hall and restaurant in San Rafael, California.</p>",

He switched to bass \u2013 an instrument he had never played \u2013 in 1965 after he was recruited by the Warlocks, a band fronted by his friend Garcia, for a show at a pizzeria in Menlo Park, California. \u201cI was so excited that I didn\u2019t have to think about it \u2026 but I knew something great was happening, something bigger than everybody, bigger than me for sure,\u201d Lesh told the Dead\u2019s publicist and official historian Dennis McNally for the 2002 book A Long Strange Trip, according to Variety. Lesh\u2019s imprint was crucial on the early sound of the Grateful Dead, often credited alongside Garcia. He co-authored a number of compositions, including St Stephen, The Eleven and Dark Star, that became staples of the jam band\u2019s repertoire. Between 1967 and 1990, Lesh appeared on all 13 of the Grateful Dead\u2019s studio releases and 10 official live albums. Along with Garcia, guitarist Bob Weir and drummer Bill Kreutzmann, Lesh remained a vital part of the improvisational band\u2019s touring lineup for 30 years. After Garcia\u2019s death in 1995 at the age of 53, Lesh was a staple of the band\u2019s later touring arrangements, including the Other Ones (1998-1999), the Dead (2003-2004, 2008-2009) and Furthur (2009-2013). He sat out the band\u2019s latest incarnation, Dead &amp; Company, fronted by John Mayer. Along with the other members of the Grateful Dead, Lesh was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. He is survived by his wife, Jill, and their sons, Grahame and Brian, both of whom performed with the Terrapin Family Band, Lesh\u2019s late-in-life band formed through his family-operated music hall and restaurant in San Rafael, California.",

The US district judge Patricia Giles granted an injunction request brought against Virginia election officials by the justice department, which claimed the voter registrations were wrongly canceled during a 90-day quiet period ahead of the November election that restricts states from making large-scale changes to their voter rolls. \u201cThe ruling is a big victory.

The voters had been flagged for removal after Virginia\u2019s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, issued an executive order on 7 August requiring election officials to check voter rolls against DMV records on a daily basis for non-citizens. Voting rights groups have long warned that such comparisons are an unreliable way to check for citizenship because someone can become a naturalized citizen after getting their driver\u2019s license or may accidentally check the wrong box at the motor vehicles department. Thomas Sanford, an attorney with the Virginia attorney general\u2019s office, told the judge at the conclusion of Friday\u2019s hearing that the state intended to appeal her ruling. The justice department and private groups, including the League of Women Voters, said many of the 1,600 voters whose registrations were canceled were in fact citizens whose registrations were canceled because of bureaucratic errors or simple mistakes like a mischecked box on a form. Justice department lawyer Sejal Jhaveri said during an all-day injunction hearing on Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia, that\u2019s precisely why federal law prevents states from implementing systematic changes to the voter rolls in the 90 days before an election, \u201cto prevent the harm of having eligible voters removed in a period where it\u2019s hard to remedy\u201d. Giles said on Friday that the state was not completely prohibited from removing non-citizens from the voting rolls during the 90-day quiet period, but that it must do so on an individualized basis rather than the automated, systematic program employed by the state. State officials argued unsuccessfully that the canceled registrations followed careful procedures that targeted people who explicitly identified themselves as non-citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Charles Cooper, a lawyer for the state, said during arguments on Thursday that the federal law was never intended to provide protections to non-citizens, who by definition cannot vote in federal elections. \u201cCongress couldn\u2019t possibly have intended to prevent the removal ... of persons who were never eligible to vote in the first place,\u201d Cooper argued. The plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit, though, said that many people are wrongly identified as non-citizens by the DMV simply by checking the wrong box on a form. They were unable to identify exactly how many of the 1,600 purged voters are in fact citizens \u2013 Virginia only identified this week the names and addresses of the affected individuals in response to a court order \u2013 but provided anecdotal evidence of individuals whose registrations were wrongly canceled. Cooper acknowledged that some of the 1,600 voters identified by the state as non-citizens may well be citizens, but he said restoring all of them to the rolls means that in all likelihood, \u201cthere\u2019s going to hundreds of non-citizens back on those rolls.

The Trump campaign was informed this week that the phone numbers of the Republican presidential and vice-presidential nominee were among those targeted during a breach of the Verizon network, the paper said, citing sources. Investigators are working to determine what data, if any, was accessed by the \u201csophisticated\u201d hack, the sources said. Other current and former government officials were also targeted, according to the report. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed an investigation was under way into the \u201cunauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d. It did not name the Trump campaign in the statement. \u201cAfter the FBI identified specific malicious activity targeting the sector, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims,\u201d the agency said. The Trump campaign did not directly address whether the phones used by Trump and Vance had been targeted. In a statement, a Trump campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, criticized the White House and Trump\u2019s opponent, Kamala Harris, and sought to blame them for allowing a foreign adversary to target the campaign, the Times reported. A Wall Street Journal report last month said a cyber-attack linked to the Chinese government had infiltrated multiple US telecommunications firms and may have gained access to systems used by the federal government in court-approved wiretapping efforts. The hackers accessed at least three telecommunication companies \u2013 AT&amp;T, Verizon and Lumen Technologies \u2013 in what may have been an attempt to find sensitive information related to national security, according to the report. The Trump campaign earlier this year revealed it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. The US justice department unsealed criminal charges in September against three members of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps suspected of hacking the Trump campaign. Justice department officials said hackers were trying to undermine Trump\u2019s campaign and intended to sow discord, exploit divisions within American society and potentially influence the outcome of the 5 November election. With the election under two weeks away, Trump and Kamala Harris are locked in a tight race.

It was thought that the bluestones represented one of the earliest phases of the monument. Charcoal recovered suggested a date of around 2300BC for the construction of the bluestone circle, but most interesting of all were finds that pointed towards significant modification in the later Roman period, with stone working going on well into the early medieval.

He was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the son of Michael, an engineer, and Winnie, a nurse, who both loved history and took Tim to visit heritage sites when he was a child. At All Saints\u2019 school, he participated in local excavations at weekends and during school holidays, and by 17 had risen to site supervisor. He was directing his own excavations before he went to study archaeology at Southampton University in 1976. </p> <p>His first archaeological paper, on neolithic Gloucestershire, was published when he was 20, and he went on to do a PhD at Southampton on the neolithic chambered tombs of Wales and western England, which he received in 1983. Darvill combined his studies with summers spent on digs, including his own project at a neolithic site near Cheltenham.</p> <p>His time at Southampton was a formative experience, during which he was taught by the leading prehistorian Colin Renfrew. With his fellow students Mike Parker Pearson, Bob Smith and Roger Thomas, in 1977 Darvill organised a conference titled New Approaches to Our Past, publishing the proceedings the following year. This brought Darvill to the attention of Wainwright, at English Heritage, who became his mentor, active supporter and close friend. While the other three students joined the staff of English Heritage, Darvill returned to Gloucestershire and in 1985 took the bold decision to set up his own private practice consultancy, delivering research and development projects for government agencies, developers and local authorities. </p> <p>Such consultancies were virtually unknown at that time, and his decision was extremely forward looking. He picked up a stream of contracts, researching and publishing strategies to ensure the preservation and management of archaeological remains, and quickly established himself as a leading light in the relatively new field of cultural resource management.</p>    <p>Darvill had no truck with the perception of archaeologists as anti-development, and believed that working with developers was the best means of securing successful outcomes. He contributed to the environmental impact assessment for the Channel tunnel and advised on the implications of a proposed major retail development in Cirencester. With characteristic foresight he recognised that the anticipated programme of archaeological investigation in the town would be beyond the capacity of the local excavation committee, run then by people in their spare time. The relationship between archaeology and development was changing, and a more professional approach was required. </p> <p>He persuaded the committee that it should reconstitute itself as a limited company and registered charity. A trust was duly formed, and Darvill became its chairman in 1992, a position he held until his death. <a href=\"https://cotswoldarchaeology.co.uk/how-we-work/\">Cotswold Archaeology</a> is now one of the largest professional archaeology companies in the UK, and the link with the archaeology of his home county was one that he cherished.</p> <p>Darvill was never worried by his inexperience or lack of years compared with his more senior peers. He was confident in his own abilities, did not naturally defer to those older than him, and could be combative in defending his opinions.</p> <p>While still in his 20s he had published Prehistoric Britain (1987), which became a standard text on many undergraduate courses. Its chapter titles drew on his love of music; for instance, the section on hunter-gatherer societies was titled Bands on the Run. Later publications included Prehistoric Britain from the Air (1996), Long Barrows of the Cotswolds (2004), Stonehenge: The Biography of a Landscape (2006) and Prehistoric Gloucestershire (2013), and he compiled the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology (2010).</p> <p>Appointed in 1991 to the newly established chair of archaeology and property development at Bournemouth Polytechnic (later University), aged 33, he was then the youngest person appointed to a chair of archaeology since Sir Barry Cunliffe in 1966. He was a young man in a hurry, and threw himself into the role with gusto. </p> <p>As director of what is now the <a href=\"https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/about/our-faculties/faculty-science-technology/our-departments/department-archaeology-anthropology\">department of archaeology and anthropology</a> at Bournemouth, he delivered popular undergraduate units on heritage, archaeological practice and neolithic Europe over three decades. In the mid-1990s he won a contract for \u00a31m \u2013 a very large sum for an archaeological consultancy \u2013 to undertake the Monuments at Risk Survey (Mars) for English Heritage, studying the changing state of England\u2019s archaeology and providing recommendations for monitoring change at hundreds of historic sites. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/15/geoff-wainwright-obituary\">Geoff Wainwright obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Later he directed the Archaeological Investigations Project, again funded by English Heritage, which produced a comprehensive listing of the more than 80,000 projects undertaken in England between 1990 and 2010. He was appointed OBE in 2010.</p> <p>Darvill was always most comfortable in the company of other archaeologists, talking and debating, ideally over a curry and a pint. He did find time for other things in life, particularly music, and was the guitarist in a Bournemouth-based rock group called the Standing Stones. His other interests included folk traditions and book collecting; he possessed an enormous archaeological library from which he drew much pleasure. </p> <p>He married his partner, Caoimhe Irvine, a fellow archaeologist, in hospital shortly before his death, and she survives him. </p> <p> \u2022 Timothy Charles Darvill, archaeologist, born 22 December 1957; died 5 October 2024</p>",

A trust was duly formed, and Darvill became its chairman in 1992, a position he held until his death. Cotswold Archaeology is now one of the largest professional archaeology companies in the UK, and the link with the archaeology of his home county was one that he cherished. Darvill was never worried by his inexperience or lack of years compared with his more senior peers. He was confident in his own abilities, did not naturally defer to those older than him, and could be combative in defending his opinions. While still in his 20s he had published Prehistoric Britain (1987), which became a standard text on many undergraduate courses. Its chapter titles drew on his love of music; for instance, the section on hunter-gatherer societies was titled Bands on the Run. Later publications included Prehistoric Britain from the Air (1996), Long Barrows of the Cotswolds (2004), Stonehenge: The Biography of a Landscape (2006) and Prehistoric Gloucestershire (2013), and he compiled the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology (2010). Appointed in 1991 to the newly established chair of archaeology and property development at Bournemouth Polytechnic (later University), aged 33, he was then the youngest person appointed to a chair of archaeology since Sir Barry Cunliffe in 1966. He was a young man in a hurry, and threw himself into the role with gusto. As director of what is now the department of archaeology and anthropology at Bournemouth, he delivered popular undergraduate units on heritage, archaeological practice and neolithic Europe over three decades. In the mid-1990s he won a contract for \u00a31m \u2013 a very large sum for an archaeological consultancy \u2013 to undertake the Monuments at Risk Survey (Mars) for English Heritage, studying the changing state of England\u2019s archaeology and providing recommendations for monitoring change at hundreds of historic sites. Later he directed the Archaeological Investigations Project, again funded by English Heritage, which produced a comprehensive listing of the more than 80,000 projects undertaken in England between 1990 and 2010. He was appointed OBE in 2010. Darvill was always most comfortable in the company of other archaeologists, talking and debating, ideally over a curry and a pint. He did find time for other things in life, particularly music, and was the guitarist in a Bournemouth-based rock group called the Standing Stones. His other interests included folk traditions and book collecting; he possessed an enormous archaeological library from which he drew much pleasure. He married his partner, Caoimhe Irvine, a fellow archaeologist, in hospital shortly before his death, and she survives him. \u2022 Timothy Charles Darvill, archaeologist, born 22 December 1957; died 5 October 2024",

The papers\u2019 leaders have made it clear that they either want Trump (who is, after all, a boon to large personal fortunes) or that they don\u2019t wish to risk the ex-president\u2019s wrath and retribution if he wins. If the latter was a factor, it\u2019s based on a shortsighted judgment, since Trump has been a hazard to press rights and would only be emboldened in a second term. \u201cDisturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage,\u201d the wrote former Washington Post editor Marty Baron on Friday on X, blasting the Post\u2019s decision. He predicted that Trump would see this as an invitation to try further to intimidate Bezos, a dynamic detailed in Baron\u2019s 2023 book Collision of Power. The editorials editor at the Los Angeles Times, Mariel Garza, resigned this week over the owner\u2019s decision to kill off the editorial board\u2019s planned endorsement of Harris. \u201cI am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,\u201d Garza told Columbia Journalism Review\u2019s editor, Sewell Chan. \u201cIn dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I\u2019m standing up.\u201d Others, including a Pulitzer prize-winning editorial writer at the California paper, followed her principled lead. The Washington Post editor at large Robert Kagan resigned in protest, too. They do so at considerable personal cost, since there are so few similar positions in today\u2019s financially troubled media industry. Some news organizations upheld their duty and remained true to their mission. The New York Times endorsed Harris last month, calling her \u201cthe only patriotic choice for president\u201d, and writing that Trump \u201chas proved himself morally unfit for an office that asks its occupant to put the good of the nation above self-interest\u201d. The Guardian, too, strongly endorsed Harris, saying she would \u201cunlock democracy\u2019s potential, not give in to its flaws\u201d, and calling Trump a \u201ctransactional and corrupting politician\u201d. Meanwhile, the Murdoch-controlled New York Post has endorsed Trump. Although that decision lacks a moral core, it\u2019s far from surprising. But the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post decisions are, in their way, far worse. They constitute \u201can abdication\u201d, said Jelani Cobb, dean of Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. (I run an ethics center and teach there.) The refusal to endorse, he told me, \u201ctacitly equalizes two wildly distinct candidates, one of whom has tried to overturn a presidential election and one of whom has not\u201d. As for the message this refusal sends to the public? It\u2019s ugly. Readers will reasonably conclude that the newspapers were intimidated. And people will fairly question, Cobb said, when else they \u201chave chosen expediency over courage\u201d. This is no moment to stand at the sidelines \u2013 shrugging, speechless and self-interested. With the most consequential election of the modern era only days away, the silence is deafening.

      "bodyText": "The French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe has been left entirely without power after striking workers seized control of the territory\u2019s power station. Employees at the power station in the industrial zone of Jarry entered the command room \u201cand caused an emergency shutdown of all the engines\u201d, the Guadeloupe prefecture said in a statement on Friday. The power cut comes amid a spate of unrest in French overseas territories including the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique and New Caledonia in the Pacific, where inhabitants complain that living standards are well below those of mainland France. Police intervened and the archipelago\u2019s prefect had \u201crequisitioned\u201d staff to bring the station back up to speed, it said. Marie-Line Bassette, director of EDF, the company that provides Guadeloupe with power, told France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions that it was \u201cirresponsible to go as far as a blackout to deprive all of Guadeloupe of electricity for demands when there are means to manage this type of situation\u201d. The French government has mobilised \u201cservices and operators\u201d to bring power back as soon as possible, said the energy minister, Olga Givernet. A labour dispute over pay has pitted the energy branch of the CGT union against the EDF utility since 15 September. Power outages have affected daily life in Jarry, the economic powerhouse of the French territory of close to 380,000 inhabitants, over the past week. Leon Prosper Jimmy, an ambulance driver in Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre, said that taking charge of patients in apartment buildings had become difficult because of non-functioning lifts. \u201cWe have to carry them,\u201d he said, saying he often called the fire brigade or other services for backup. \u201cWe manage as best we can,\u201d said the 41-year old. The CHUG hospital centre said it had activated backup power generators which would keep \u201ccritical operations\u201d going for 72 hours. In a supermarket near the capital, inhabitants were stocking up with bottled water as the territory\u2019s water supply began to be affected. Many store shelves were empty as supplies were disrupted. Guadeloupe looks after its own electricity needs, having no interconnection agreements with other countries. Its power production is 70% thermal, stemming from burning fuel oil or wood pellets. In Martinique, protesters defied curfews and clashed with police overnight into Friday morning, officials there said, more than a month since demonstrations erupted over rising living costs. Clashes broke out as police tried to clear protesters\u2019 roadblocks, the Martinique administration said. Crowds also tried to hijack a truck carrying fuel, it added. The Martinique administration said one person was arrested overnight and many businesses had warned that the protests were having a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact on the local economy.",

A senior scientist has warned that the leadership responsible for the data held by UK Biobank \u201chave to be very careful with ensuring that correct processes are followed\u201d around access to the information in order to maintain public confidence. Biobank holds the genetic data and medical records of more than 500,000 participants, which it shares in anonymised form with academics and researchers to support new scientific discoveries and medical advances. Last week the Guardian reported that a group called the Human Diversity Foundation (HDF), which carries out pseudoscientific research purporting to prove fundamental differences between races, had been covertly filmed discussing UK Biobank data. Mainstream geneticists consider such research to be a racist pseudoscience without supporting evidence. The footage was obtained by an undercover activist from the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate and shared with journalists. On the day of the Guardian\u2019s publication, Biobank issued a statement criticising the report and dismissing the findings. It said it had concluded what it called a \u201cfull\u201d and \u201cextensive\u201d investigation that had found no evidence of misuse of UK Biobank data. Biobank said it believed the group was discussing access to publicly available statistics that summarise the results of studies, rather than the anonymised data of the volunteers themselves. However, in correspondence with a senior medic the following day, which has been seen by the Guardian, the Biobank chief executive, Prof Sir Rory Collins, said its inquiries were continuing. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we are pursuing further investigations to confirm whether or not there has been any misuse of UK Biobank data,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we discover that participant-level data have been obtained illegitimately or that unapproved analyses have been conducted, we will use all available sanctions available to us (including legal measures).\u201d The comments appeared at odds with Biobank\u2019s public announcement about the conclusion of its investigation.

A release by TER said its board \u2013 (Ellis Genge, George, Maro Itoje, Joe Marler and Anthony Watson) \u2013 \u201cexpressed extensive concerns about the current rest provisions for England players, as well as highlighting the specific player welfare issues faced by international players\u201d.</p> \n<p>A four-year agreement has been reached, however, days before England begin their autumn campaign against New Zealand on Saturday week. A management advisory group for the EPS has been established while an exemption process to manage player workload, where an individual is getting close to the 30-game limit, has been introduced. A research project will also be undertaken and reviewed at the end of the 2024-25 season, which will inform future welfare and rest provisions.</p> \n<p>George said: \u201cWhile we have reservations about some aspects of the current protocols, we\u2019re encouraged by the progress made. Reducing games from 35 to 30 demonstrates a commitment to player welfare that we believe is crucial for the success of English rugby. However, the intensity of international rugby is greater than ever, and we believe that specific international rest protocols need to be explored. We hope that the results of the research project will support this.\u201d</p> \n<p>The enhanced contracts are the key part of the new Professional Game Partnership between the RFU and the Premiership clubs unveiled in September. George was one of two players offered a contract last season, along with Itoje, to ward off interest from clubs in France. The list of 17 features three fly-halves \u2013 Marcus Smith, George Ford and Fin Smith \u2013 but just one prop, Genge, a demonstration of the lack of depth Borthwick has in the front row. Both Dan Cole, 37, and Marler, 34, should play significant roles in the autumn Tests with Borthwick still reliant on their experience.</p> \n<p>Curry\u2019s inclusion is significant given he feared he may have to retire last year due to a hip injury. He was taken on the summer tour of Japan and New Zealand but Sale Sharks have said he will have to be managed through the season. Elliot Daly and Chandler Cunningham-South can consider themselves unfortunate to miss out.</p> \n<p>The PGP is worth \u00a333m a year to the clubs. Borthwick has greater control over the 17 players selected when it comes to strength and conditioning decisions and will have the final say on sports science and medical matters. That suggests Borthwick can influence when clubs can \u2013 or more pertinently cannot \u2013 select those players with some directors of rugby expressing their concerns. </p> \n<p>While Genge is the only prop awarded a deal, George and Theo Dan are the two hookers given contracts. Ollie Chessum, George Martin, Itoje, Ben Earl and Curry complete the forwards. In the backs, Alex Mitchell \u2013 currently sidelined with a neck injury \u2013 is the only scrum-half while Ollie Lawrence, Henry Slade, Tommy Freeman, George Furbank and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso join the three fly-halves.</p> \n<p>Borthwick is able to award up to 25 contracts but has chosen to hand out fewer. Players selected to represent England who are not among the chosen 17 will continue to receive a match fee. \u201cI am confident that these contracts, and our strong relationship with the Premiership clubs, will play a significant role in England Rugby\u2019s continued development,\u201d Borthwick said.</p> \n<p>The EPS deal also enables increased commercial opportunities for England players. Genge said: \u201cAs a group, we felt that there was an opportunity with the new agreement to look at the commercialisation of England players, both collectively and individually, and we wanted to be at the forefront of these changes. The RFU also recognised that enhancing players\u2019 commercial potential is an area that has not yet been maximised across rugby union and we hope these new measures bring in new partners and new fans.\u201d</p>",

The contracts have finally been announced as part of a new Elite Player Squad agreement brokered by Team England Rugby (TER) \u2013 an organisation set up by the players to negotiate with the RFU after the decision was made to break away from the Rugby Players\u2019 Association. The EPS is made up of 50 players including the 17 with enhanced deals. Negotiations with the RFU have been far from plain sailing with player welfare protocols and affordability for the union said to be among the stumbling blocks. A release by TER said its board \u2013 (Ellis Genge, George, Maro Itoje, Joe Marler and Anthony Watson) \u2013 \u201cexpressed extensive concerns about the current rest provisions for England players, as well as highlighting the specific player welfare issues faced by international players\u201d. A four-year agreement has been reached, however, days before England begin their autumn campaign against New Zealand on Saturday week. A management advisory group for the EPS has been established while an exemption process to manage player workload, where an individual is getting close to the 30-game limit, has been introduced. A research project will also be undertaken and reviewed at the end of the 2024-25 season, which will inform future welfare and rest provisions. George said: \u201cWhile we have reservations about some aspects of the current protocols, we\u2019re encouraged by the progress made. Reducing games from 35 to 30 demonstrates a commitment to player welfare that we believe is crucial for the success of English rugby. However, the intensity of international rugby is greater than ever, and we believe that specific international rest protocols need to be explored. We hope that the results of the research project will support this.\u201d The enhanced contracts are the key part of the new Professional Game Partnership between the RFU and the Premiership clubs unveiled in September. George was one of two players offered a contract last season, along with Itoje, to ward off interest from clubs in France. The list of 17 features three fly-halves \u2013 Marcus Smith, George Ford and Fin Smith \u2013 but just one prop, Genge, a demonstration of the lack of depth Borthwick has in the front row. Both Dan Cole, 37, and Marler, 34, should play significant roles in the autumn Tests with Borthwick still reliant on their experience. Curry\u2019s inclusion is significant given he feared he may have to retire last year due to a hip injury. He was taken on the summer tour of Japan and New Zealand but Sale Sharks have said he will have to be managed through the season. Elliot Daly and Chandler Cunningham-South can consider themselves unfortunate to miss out. The PGP is worth \u00a333m a year to the clubs. Borthwick has greater control over the 17 players selected when it comes to strength and conditioning decisions and will have the final say on sports science and medical matters. That suggests Borthwick can influence when clubs can \u2013 or more pertinently cannot \u2013 select those players with some directors of rugby expressing their concerns. While Genge is the only prop awarded a deal, George and Theo Dan are the two hookers given contracts. Ollie Chessum, George Martin, Itoje, Ben Earl and Curry complete the forwards. In the backs, Alex Mitchell \u2013 currently sidelined with a neck injury \u2013 is the only scrum-half while Ollie Lawrence, Henry Slade, Tommy Freeman, George Furbank and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso join the three fly-halves. Borthwick is able to award up to 25 contracts but has chosen to hand out fewer. Players selected to represent England who are not among the chosen 17 will continue to receive a match fee. \u201cI am confident that these contracts, and our strong relationship with the Premiership clubs, will play a significant role in England Rugby\u2019s continued development,\u201d Borthwick said. The EPS deal also enables increased commercial opportunities for England players. Genge said: \u201cAs a group, we felt that there was an opportunity with the new agreement to look at the commercialisation of England players, both collectively and individually, and we wanted to be at the forefront of these changes. The RFU also recognised that enhancing players\u2019 commercial potential is an area that has not yet been maximised across rugby union and we hope these new measures bring in new partners and new fans.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brianna Ghey\u2019s murder could not have been foreseen by her school or those of her killers, a coroner has said as she recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. Brianna, 16, was stabbed to death in a \u201csadistic\u201d and \u201cexceptionally brutal\u201d murder in a Warrington park on 11 February 2023 by Eddie Ratcliffe and Scarlett Jenkinson, who were both 15 at the time. Jenkinson was jailed for at least 22 years and Ratcliffe for a minimum of 20 years for stabbing Brianna with a hunting knife 28 times in her head, neck, chest and back. At the inquest into the teenager\u2019s death, which began on Wednesday and lasted three days, Cheshire senior coroner Jacqueline Devonish said the local authorities overseeing the services that encountered Brianna and her killers could not have anticipated her murder. Brianna had been a pupil at Birchwood High School, Warrington, where she was befriended by Jenkinson, who had transferred from Culcheth High School after she \u201cspiked\u201d a younger pupil with cannabis-laced sweets. Following her \u201cmanaged transfer\u201d from Culcheth, where Ratcliffe was a pupil, within weeks Jenkinson became obsessed by Brianna and began plotting her murder with Ratcliffe. From age 14, Jenkinson had enjoyed watching videos of real killing and torture on the dark web, fantasised about murder and developed an interest in serial killers, her murder trial heard. But her \u201cdark fantasies\u201d were not known to either school or any other adults, their trial heard. The inquest at Warrington coroner\u2019s court examined safeguarding for all three teenagers and how Brianna was brought into contact with Jenkinson. But the hearing was told that despite Jenkinson\u2019s misbehaviour in school, no one could have foreseen she was planning and would go on to murder Brianna. Concluding the inquest, Devonish said: \u201cThere was no reason for anyone to suspect the friendship was anything other than genuine. \u201cI found Birchwood High School offered Brianna a high standard of support within a caring environment.\u201d Devonish said there were no visible signs that Brianna was at risk from Jenkinson. She added: \u201cShe had been planning Brianna\u2019s murder since late 2022. Eddie Ratcliffe was the only person who knew, other than Scarlett Jenkinson. \u201cI found that the schools could not have reasonably foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe would have plotted and murdered Brianna. \u201cIt could not have, on the evidence available at the time, reasonably have been foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson was mentally unstable so that she would kill.\u201d Both Brianna and Jenkinson had personal issues affecting their schooling. Jenkinson had assaulted another pupil and turned up for class drunk and smelling of cannabis. Brianna had been diagnosed with autism and ADHD. Esther Ghey, her mother, said her daughter had become \u201cimmersed in darkness\u201d, falling behind in schoolwork and spending a lot of time online, garnering thousands of followers on TikTok and YouTube by posting video content. But Ghey said her daughter\u2019s online world was \u201cvery toxic\u201d and she was deemed to be at risk of sexual exploitation. Before her murder, concerns had been raised about Brianna\u2019s interactions online but she had refused to let her mother have access to her phone, and her school could not take the device off her either, the hearing was told. Esther Ghey is now campaigning to raise awareness of the dangers of social media to children and for greater parental controls to be put in place.",

After three years of negotiations, Mike Henry, BHP\u2019s chief executive, announced on Friday that a \u201cmilestone\u201d deal would ensure compensation for all those affected by the catastrophic collapse of the Fund\u00e3o dam in 2015.

Dean was seen heating a liquid in a pan on a hob before hurling it in the face of Riley while he was sitting in a chair at a property in Tipi Valley in Carmarthenshire. Tipi Valley is an off-grid eco-community founded in 1976 near the village of Llandeilo. Among its residents is Swampy \u2013 real name Daniel Hooper, 51 \u2013 who came to prominence in the 1990s for protests including spending a week in a tunnel in an attempt to prevent work on the A30 in Fairmile, Devon. Most recently, Hooper has been part of groups camping in treehouses and tunnels as part of Stop HS2 protests including in Euston Square Gardens, London, while also raising three children with his wife, Clare, at Tipi Valley. The community-bought fields stretch over 81 hectares (200 acres) and many of the residents live in tipis, yurts and turf-roofed huts. Some of the adults work as labourers and teachers in nearby villages, while others stay in the valley full-time and live off-grid.

      "body": "<p>These are tough economic times for small-scale craft breweries, as recent closures have sadly <a href=\"https://beernouveau.co.uk/why-are-so-many-breweries-closing/\">illustrated</a>. But the ethos of creative defiance and quirky independence lives on. At the annual Didsbury beer festival in Manchester this weekend, drinking possibilities <a href=\"https://didsburybeerfestival.org.uk/images/2024-beer-list.pdf\">range</a> from the intriguingly named Interior Life in the Exterior World, by the Mancunian brewer Cloudwater, to the less angsty Superdelic Single Hop, from Big Trip. Sellout crowds have testified to the resilience of a sector that combines playfulness with an&nbsp;intense seriousness about hoppy beer.</p> <p>Successfully appealing to the cognoscenti, however, is one thing. Courting non-aficionados, and coping with ever more wily multinational competitors, is quite another. A survey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/22/indie-brewers-ditch-craft-beer-tag-as-drinkers-are-misled-by-global-brands\">commissioned</a> by the Society of Independent Brewers and Associates (Siba) has found that clever branding, combined with judicious takeovers of successful independents, is allowing industry giants to muscle in and profit from pushing their own pseudo-artisanal vibe. Just under half of those questioned by YouGov believed, for example, that the rough-and-ready sounding Neck Oil beer is brewed by an independent, when in fact it is the product of Heineken-owned Beavertown.</p> <p>Having realised that local authenticity sells, global beer companies have gone out and bought it. Popular brands such as Camden Town and Blue Moon have been stealthily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/11/indie-brewers-fight-back-in-bitter-row-over-beer-brands-craft-credentials\">swallowed up</a> behind the scenes. Beavertown was the 2011 north London creation of Logan Plant, son of Robert, the Led Zeppelin star. Two years ago, Heineken took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/07/london-craft-brewer-beavertown-sells-up-fully-to-heineken\">full control</a> of the company.

      "bodyText": "These are tough economic times for small-scale craft breweries, as recent closures have sadly illustrated. But the ethos of creative defiance and quirky independence lives on. At the annual Didsbury beer festival in Manchester this weekend, drinking possibilities range from the intriguingly named Interior Life in the Exterior World, by the Mancunian brewer Cloudwater, to the less angsty Superdelic Single Hop, from Big Trip. Sellout crowds have testified to the resilience of a sector that combines playfulness with an intense seriousness about hoppy beer. Successfully appealing to the cognoscenti, however, is one thing. Courting non-aficionados, and coping with ever more wily multinational competitors, is quite another. A survey commissioned by the Society of Independent Brewers and Associates (Siba) has found that clever branding, combined with judicious takeovers of successful independents, is allowing industry giants to muscle in and profit from pushing their own pseudo-artisanal vibe. Just under half of those questioned by YouGov believed, for example, that the rough-and-ready sounding Neck Oil beer is brewed by an independent, when in fact it is the product of Heineken-owned Beavertown. Having realised that local authenticity sells, global beer companies have gone out and bought it. Popular brands such as Camden Town and Blue Moon have been stealthily swallowed up behind the scenes. Beavertown was the 2011 north London creation of Logan Plant, son of Robert, the Led Zeppelin star. Two years ago, Heineken took full control of the company. It now profits from its Tottenham associations, selling One of Our Own Beavertown IPA at Spurs\u2019 stadium. Three-quarters of those surveyed by YouGov said they felt that a lack of clarity over actual ownership was misleading drinkers who wanted to spend their money supporting local, small-scale producers. In a rearguard action, Siba has decided to abandon the \u201ccraft\u201d label altogether, in favour of a more clearly definable \u201cindie beer\u201d identity. The rebranding marks the beginning of a campaign to reclaim the artisanal brewing space for its members, which must be British businesses, truly independent and responsible for less than 1% of UK beer production. A mark that Siba hopes will be visible on beer pumps, bottles and cans will enable punters to check the bona fides of the beer they are about to buy.

Brandon Woolveridge, 25, had been jailed for 42 months at Preston crown court in October last year. On Friday, he was jailed for 27 months at the same court for what judge Heather Lloyd described as offence with an \u201cidentical modus operandi\u201d. Woolveridge had been released on either 11 or 12 September, the court heard, under the scheme designed to ease jail overcrowding. Less than two weeks later, he had been arrested again by Cumbria police, after he made a phone call on 24 September demanding \u00a31,000 for the return of a missing dog. Prosecuting, Paul Brookwell said that the victim, Mandy Butler, who works as a volunteer with the Lost Dog Tracking Team, helping to reunite people with missing pets, had received another call two days previously demanding money, which she believed had also been made by Woolveridge, having recognised his voice from his previous offending.

He had victims all over the country, responding to adverts that had been posted on social media about lost or stolen pets, and in some cases threatening to kill the animals if their owners did not pay up. In a statement read to the court, Butler said she was an animal lover who had been volunteering in the role for 11 years. \u201cI see the trauma and upset of people who have lost their pets,\u201d she said. \u201cPets are part of the family,\u201d and she had been upset to see \u201cBrandon and his gang try to exploit this trauma\u201d for money.

A draft version of the final communique that was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6vy79p750o\">leaked to the BBC this week</a> said leaders had \u201cagreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity\u201d.</p> \n<p>Amid mounting pressure, a source in No 10 said the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/uk-open-to-discussing-non-cash-forms-of-reparatory-justice-for-former-colonies\">could support some forms of reparatory justice</a>, such as restructuring financial institutions and providing debt relief.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"edab2c85-f702-4996-8030-67f02b992873\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TvHgu_fRW-4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This was initially welcomed by the Labour MP Diane Abbott, who sits on the <a href=\"https://www.appg-ar.org/\">all-party parliamentary group for Afrikan reparations</a>. She said she was \u201cglad that Starmer seems to have backed off from his complete hostility to the concept of reparations. It remains to be seen what he means by \u2018non-financial reparative justice\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some campaigners were frustrated by what they felt was either a game of semantics on the issue or a deliberate misrepresentation of what the campaign for reparations is. Part of the <a href=\"https://caricom.org/caricom-ten-point-plan-for-reparatory-justice/\">long-established 10-point plan</a> for reparatory justice by the Caribbean community (Caricom) is debt cancellation, while others have long campaigned on the link between reparatory justice and climate resilience.</p> \n<p>Michael McEachrane, the UN rapporteur of the permanent forum on people of African descent, said: \u201cKeir Starmer misrepresents reparations \u2026 It is a matter of taking responsibility for and transforming legacies of the past in the present.\u201d Only then, McEachrane added, would the Commonwealth community see \u201cgreater equity within and among countries\u201d.</p> \n<p>When No 10 was pressed to explain what it meant by non-financial reparative justice in Friday\u2019s press briefing, a spokesperson pushed back on the idea. The prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson said: \u201cOur position on reparations is clear, and that goes for other forms of non-financial reparatory justice too. The prime minister\u2019s focus is on addressing the challenges that we face.\u201d</p> \n<p>In response, Abbott said: \u201cIncredible that Starmer wants to treat the leaders of fellow Commonwealth countries with such disrespect. And it is offensive that he seems to be saying that he knows what they want to discuss better than they themselves do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another Labour MP, Clive Lewis, questioned how Starmer and his team could have gone to the summit and not expected reparations to come up. \u201cHas he not been paying attention to the African Union, Caricom, [the Barbados PM] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/barbados-pm-says-country-owed-49tn-as-she-makes-fresh-call-for-reparations\">Mia Mottley</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.e3g.org/news/the-bridgetown-initiative-a-climate-and-development-plan-for-cop27/\">Bridgetown Initiative</a>? This is what has been happening whilst he has been in politics,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt looks very much like they\u2019ve said, in a very kind of colonial mindset, that this is not for discussion. It\u2019s not on the agenda. Well, that\u2019s not going to go down well in a Commonwealth of equals.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lewis, who called in parliament for the UK to enter into negotiations with Caribbean leaders on paying reparations for Britain\u2019s role in slavery, said: \u201cYou have to ask the question, given that David Lammy [the foreign secretary] himself is a son of Guyana, who has been talking about this for years, the person who came after Bernie Grant: someone lost a memo somewhere.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that David didn\u2019t know that this was going to come up, and someone must have told No 10 this was coming up \u2026 it is quite revealing of something.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs have urged Keir Starmer to clarify his government\u2019s position on non-cash reparations for Britain\u2019s historical role in the slave trade, as No 10 says the issue is off the table. In the run-up to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm), the government said it would not be issuing an official state apology. While travelling to the conference, which began on Friday in the Pacific island nation of Samoa, the prime minister told reporters he wanted to \u201clook forward\u201d rather than have \u201cvery long endless discussions about reparations on the past\u201d. King Charles acknowledged \u201cpainful aspects\u201d of Britain\u2019s past but sidestepped calls to directly address reparations for slavery, saying: \u201cNone of us can change the past, but we can commit \u2026 to learning its lessons.\u201d Despite the insistence from Downing Street that the issue was not on the agenda for the summit of 56 Commonwealth countries, leaders were prepared to defy the UK. A draft version of the final communique that was leaked to the BBC this week said leaders had \u201cagreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity\u201d. Amid mounting pressure, a source in No 10 said the UK could support some forms of reparatory justice, such as restructuring financial institutions and providing debt relief. This was initially welcomed by the Labour MP Diane Abbott, who sits on the all-party parliamentary group for Afrikan reparations. She said she was \u201cglad that Starmer seems to have backed off from his complete hostility to the concept of reparations. It remains to be seen what he means by \u2018non-financial reparative justice\u2019.\u201d Some campaigners were frustrated by what they felt was either a game of semantics on the issue or a deliberate misrepresentation of what the campaign for reparations is. Part of the long-established 10-point plan for reparatory justice by the Caribbean community (Caricom) is debt cancellation, while others have long campaigned on the link between reparatory justice and climate resilience. Michael McEachrane, the UN rapporteur of the permanent forum on people of African descent, said: \u201cKeir Starmer misrepresents reparations \u2026 It is a matter of taking responsibility for and transforming legacies of the past in the present.\u201d Only then, McEachrane added, would the Commonwealth community see \u201cgreater equity within and among countries\u201d. When No 10 was pressed to explain what it meant by non-financial reparative justice in Friday\u2019s press briefing, a spokesperson pushed back on the idea. The prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson said: \u201cOur position on reparations is clear, and that goes for other forms of non-financial reparatory justice too. The prime minister\u2019s focus is on addressing the challenges that we face.\u201d In response, Abbott said: \u201cIncredible that Starmer wants to treat the leaders of fellow Commonwealth countries with such disrespect. And it is offensive that he seems to be saying that he knows what they want to discuss better than they themselves do.\u201d Another Labour MP, Clive Lewis, questioned how Starmer and his team could have gone to the summit and not expected reparations to come up. \u201cHas he not been paying attention to the African Union, Caricom, [the Barbados PM] Mia Mottley, the Bridgetown Initiative? This is what has been happening whilst he has been in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks very much like they\u2019ve said, in a very kind of colonial mindset, that this is not for discussion. It\u2019s not on the agenda. Well, that\u2019s not going to go down well in a Commonwealth of equals.\u201d Lewis, who called in parliament for the UK to enter into negotiations with Caribbean leaders on paying reparations for Britain\u2019s role in slavery, said: \u201cYou have to ask the question, given that David Lammy [the foreign secretary] himself is a son of Guyana, who has been talking about this for years, the person who came after Bernie Grant: someone lost a memo somewhere. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that David didn\u2019t know that this was going to come up, and someone must have told No 10 this was coming up \u2026 it is quite revealing of something.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Does sexual assault matter politically? Eight years ago, in October of 2016, many people thought that it did. When the Access Hollywood tape was released on 7 October of that year, and audio blared from every cable news channel in which Donald Trump, attempting to impress the celebrity interviewer Billy Bush, bragged that his stardom meant he could grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d, the incident was, for a moment at least, widely believed to have ended his presidential bid. The clip sparked outrage, condemnation and calls for Trump to drop out of the race \u2013 including from sitting Republican governors, senators and representatives. The Republican National Committee <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rnc-halts-all-victory-project-work-for-trump-229363\">suspended support</a> for Trump\u2019s campaign in response to the tape. His political career was widely assumed to be over.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t. The allegations of sexual misconduct by <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2023/10/donald-trump-associates-sexual-misconduct-allegations/\">more than two dozen other women</a> that were made in the days, weeks and years thereafter \u2013 including from reporters, models, yoga instructors, Mar-a-Lago regulars, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA contestants, strangers he sat next to on planes, women who worked for him, entrepreneurs, adult film stars, advice columnists and one woman who had the misfortune of attending a Mother\u2019s Day brunch event at a Trump-owned property \u2013 did not, either. For all the seriousness and solemnity with which Republican politicians condemned Trump in the days following the release of the Access Hollywood tape \u2013 for all their furrowed brows and reverent declarations that alleged sexual assault is <em>no laughing matter \u2013 </em>ultimately, the Republican party establishment lined up behind Trump. So did their voters.</p> <p>It might be a sign of how far we have fallen that the political world, this week, barely seemed to notice when the veteran model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein\">Stacey Williams</a> came forward to say she was groped by Trump in 1993, while the pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 a close friend of Trump\u2019s and Williams\u2019s boyfriend at the time \u2013 looked on. Williams\u2019s account mirrors those provided by many of Trump\u2019s other accusers: like them, she seems to have been lewdly groped by Trump, who grabbed her breasts and buttocks in an abrupt and perfunctory fashion. Indeed, what happened to Williams sounds a bit like how Trump himself has described his conduct: \u201cI don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d</p> <p>This time, there were no calls for Donald Trump to drop out of the race; no solemn condemnations; no handwringing over whether Trump\u2019s boorishness, his braying entitlement, or his violent and vulgar treatment of women and girls might disqualify him from the power and supposed honor of the position that he\u2019s seeking. No one bothered to point out that someone who assaults women \u2013 let alone someone who does so as routinely and prolifically as Trump is said to have done \u2013 does not deserve to be the president. Even the Democrats mostly shrugged.</p> <p>Part of this, to be sure, is because hardly anyone is surprised by Trump anymore. There are few minds most Americans will ever know as intimately as we have all been forced to know Trump\u2019s. We know his narcissism, its surprising pettiness; we know his monumental vanity, his cynicism, his relentless dishonesty; we know the uncanny self-awareness of his humor \u2013 though it never, ever comes at his own expense \u2013 and we know the compass-like constancy of his devotion to his own short-term self-interest.</p> <p>We even know that he was friends with Epstein, whose predations on underage girl children Trump joked about in an interview with New York Magazine<em> </em>in the 90s. We know, already, how he behaves towards women; we have been shown. We\u2019ve learned not only from the more than two dozen women who have told us, not only from the sworn testimony of Stormy Daniels, not even only from the jury\u2019s verdict in the civil suit for rape and assault that was brought against him, successfully, by the writer E Jean Carroll. We know from watching him, as we have been compelled to do, now, for the better part of a decade.</p> <p>What might be more revealing, then, is what the non-response to Stacey Williams\u2019s story tells us about ourselves. In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election \u2013 and in direct response to the indignity American women faced when a man who bragged about and was alleged to have serially committed sexual assault was elevated to a position of superlative authority \u2013 the #MeToo movement faced a mass public reckoning over sexual violence, and its prevalence and impunity in all sectors of American life.</p> <p>Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, two investigative reporters at the New York Times, published their first story about the predations of the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein on 5 October 2017 \u2013 just two days shy of the one-year anniversary of the Access Hollywood tape. For a heady moment, powerful men who did the kinds of things Trump has been accused of \u2013 and has bragged about doing \u2013 were losing their positions of dignity and power as a result. Even Republican politicians were not immune: Roy Moore, a far-right Republican Senate candidate, lost his election in no less a deep-red state than Alabama after nine women accused him of sexual misconduct against them while he was in his 30s and they were in their teens.</p> <p>Many solemn declarations were made then, too: about the long-overdue reckoning, the pain of survivors, the need to reconsider sexual scripts, the eroticization of inequality, and the ways inequality had been weaponized to demean women and keep them from public life. All of this proceeded while Trump sat in the Oval Office. None of it could touch him: everyone presumed he was immune from any accountability for the way he treated women, and he was.</p> <p>Maybe other men are now, too. The #MeToo movement was a large and internally fractious movement, but if it can be said to have had a singular goal, it might have been this: to resolve our culture\u2019s cognitive dissonance about sexual violence. For decades, the world operated on a kind of grim hypocrisy: everyone \u2013 from the law to the HR department, from Hollywood to your weekend hobby group \u2013 professed to abhor sexual violence, to take it maximally seriously. But, in practice, sexual violence was not taken very seriously at all: the incidents were minimized, the prevalence was shrugged off, the victims were blamed, demonized and smeared as vindictive or hysterical for ever bringing it up.</p> <p>Everyone <em>said</em> they hated sexual violence and that they thought it mattered; most people acted as if they thought it didn\u2019t. The goal of #MeToo could be said to bring actions into line with words: to make people behave as if they thought sexual violence was as wrong as they said it was. Instead, it may have resolved the cognitive dissonance in the other direction: now people admit that they care very little about sexual violence. Their actions, I suppose, finally match their words.</p> <p>Before the Guardian broke Williams\u2019s story, there was a flutter of rumors about an impending accusation on social media. These were flamed by Mark Halperin, a onetime political journalist, who took to his YouTube show on Wednesday to say that he had been pitched a story about Trump that \u201ccould end\u201d the former president\u2019s campaign. Halperin\u2019s supposed story never materialized, and maybe that\u2019s to be expected: he would have been an odd choice for such a leak. After all, his own career was derailed during the #MeToo movement, when he was accused by five women of sexual misconduct and harassment \u2013 including groping of exactly the sort that Williams says Donald Trump subjected her to. He still felt comfortable shilling a possible sexual violence story anyway, despite his own history. Probably, he assumed no one would bring it up.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Speaking on Tuesday in Washington, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund suggested he was relaxed about higher debt levels to fund public investment. He made the comment in answer to a question about the UK at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, but it felt like a highly choreographed piece of theatre. Rachel Reeves was due to arrive at the meetings in the US capital the following evening and the IMF was aware that the UK chancellor was going to announce a significant overhaul of Britain\u2019s budget rules to allow for more investment by the state. In one session after another, IMF senior officials repeated the same message \u2013 the Washington-based organisation was a great believer in the power of public investment to drive growth. There was also a sizeable upgrade to Britain\u2019s growth rate this year, giving the sense of an economy bouncing back after some difficult years. It seemed like a landing strip was being prepared for Reeves in Washington to explain how her plans would further boost growth and improve living standards. A backdrop of a balmy US capital bathed in autumnal sunshine provided an opportunity for the chancellor to relax away from Westminster \u2013 after a difficult first 100 days of a Labour government and with less than a week to go before she presents her first budget. Reeves said there would be new rules in her budget next week governing Treasury borrowing, allowing debt levels to increase \u2013 experts say by up to \u00a350bn \u2013 to facilitate investment in Britain\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. IMF staff refused to comment directly on speculation about what might be in the chancellor\u2019s budget, but they didn\u2019t need to. They endorsed the principle and that was enough for Reeves to say she had the backing of a key arbiter in the world of economic planning. In one instance of this newfound affection, V\u00edtor Gaspar, director of the department that monitors budget plans at the IMF, said: \u201cOur report emphasises that public investment should be protected in budgetary procedures that foster sound macroeconomic performance. \u201cThe fact that that issue is very much at the centre of the debate in the UK right now is very much welcome.\u201d Reeves also met Janet Yellen, US treasury sectary, for a private chat on her first morning at the meetings in Washington, and the two posed for a relaxed photo with the European Central Bank boss, Christine Lagarde, and Canada\u2019s deputy premier, Chrystia Freeland, during a break in proceedings at a G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers also being held in Washington. These are powerful allies for Reeves as she seeks to regain the confidence of international institutions after the Liz Truss mini budget debacle in 2022. The conversation with each one might have been a little more tense had Reeves not announced that the UK was rejoining the economic mainstream and putting a greater emphasis on investment and cooperation between nations. Ukraine was also on the chancellor\u2019s mind when she arrived in Washington, and after meeting Yellen, Reeves spent time with Ukraine finance minister, Sergii Marchenko, who was in town to receive $1.1bn from the IMF. Britain is to lend Ukraine an additional \u00a32.26bn. The IMF did introduce some caution in its commentary. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\u2019s chief economist and director of research, said that when countries have elevated debt levels, when interest rates are high, and growth is \u201cOK but not great\u201d, there is a risk that \u201cthings could escalate or get out of control quickly\u201d. The UK is mentioned in a review of government finances as one of the countries that have an almost endless list of underfunded public services and welfare commitments, putting debt payments on an upward trajectory. The momentum is such that UK borrowing is forecast to grow \u2013 without any policy changes \u2013 from 100% in 2023 to 108.3% in 2029. That compares with a rise from 123.4% to 131.1% the IMF expects for the G7 as a whole. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s very important to bring public debt under control. It\u2019s very important to control for public debt risks,\u201d Gaspar said. The IMF has used every one of its bi-annual meetings since the 2008 crash to warn about rising debt levels. Only a handful of countries have responded to the organisation\u2019s entreaties. Next year global government borrowing is forecast to hit \u00a3100tn. In 2023 the total income of the global economy was $105tn. Much of the rise in government debt can be blamed on the world\u2019s two largest economies \u2013 the US and China. They have both sought to revive their economies with extra borrowing and are now deeply in debt. What would the election of Donald Trump mean for US debt levels? According to some assessments they would soar again, as they did during his last presidency when funds for huge tax cuts were borrowed. Trump is also feared by the IMF\u2019s top brass for the havoc he could bring to international trade after his promises of steep tariff increases on goods imported into the US. And not just from China, but Europe as well. The UK hopes it can avoid Trump\u2019s glare should he be elected on 5 November.

      "bodyText": "The number of drones seen carrying drugs into prisons soared to more than 1,000 last year as police waged a \u201cconstant battle\u201d against gangs flying in cocaine and cannabis from miles away. Official figures reveal the number of drone incidents at prisons in England and Wales has risen almost tenfold since 2020, climbing to 1,063 incursions last year. The Ministry of Justice has attempted to fight back against the often-brazen deliveries \u2013 which can even include household items like shower gel and tomato ketchup \u2013 by introducing new counter-drone laws in January. But the huge value of drugs behind bars, where they can fetch three to five times their street value, has made it a serious supply route for organised crime groups. Figures published by the Ministry of Justice reveal that the number of drones sighted or reported around prisons in England and Wales more than doubled between 2022 and 2023. Last year\u2019s total of 1,063 incidents was also more than double the total recorded between 2019 and 2021, in a sign of how the aerial smuggling route has taken off. The true figures are likely to be much higher given many successful drone deliveries go undetected. Gangs have been known to fly more than \u00a31m worth of cocaine and other drugs into a single prison over several night-time missions. Robert Knight, the governor of HMP Manchester, said the 150-year-old prison needed help to tackle the \u201cmassive problem\u201d of drugs being flown in. Speaking after inspectors raised the alarm about \u201ccatastrophic levels\u201d of drug abuse in HMP Manchester, Knight said: \u201cWe do not deny that it is a massive problem for us.\u201d Knight said corrupt officers were also smuggling contraband into the Victorian prison but that the biggest threat was from drones. Some prisoners have been known to use kettle elements to burn holes in windows so aerial deliveries can be flown straight to their cells. Det Supt Andy Buckthorpe of Greater Manchester police said it was a constant battle for authorities to keep up with the criminal gangs and their associates inside. Buckthorpe said gangs were headhunting highly skilled drone pilots from the non-criminal world to ferry their huge cargo to prison cell windows in Amazon Prime-style deliveries. Chris Rainford, a former fire service officer who trains police forces to use drones, said the phenomenon was really difficult for the authorities to tackle. \u201cSome of the drones can go up to 10km [6.2 miles] so they [the pilot] could quite easily be sat in a car at least several hundred metres away, if not a mile or two miles away,\u201d he said. The more sophisticated drones, worth several thousand pounds, are about a metre wide and equipped with thermal imaging, allowing them to transport several kilograms of illicit goods under the cover of darkness. New laws introduced in January made it a criminal offence to fly drones within 400 metres of any closed prison or young offender institution in England and Wales. Drone operators that break the rules could face fines of up to \u00a32,500 while those found smuggling illicit items will face up to 10 years in prison. Some prisons have introduced counter-drone technology to detect when unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are nearby but few, if any, are thought to actively block the devices from approaching. Mike Smith, the air safety manager at Ruas Drone Training in Newport, south Wales, said one of the reasons for this was that signal blockers also interfered with technology such as CCTV and car key fobs. Other air defences also have their limitations. Dutch police briefly tried using highly trained eagles to capture drones out of the sky but abandoned the trial because the birds were too unpredictable. Smith said: \u201cThe problem with prisons is that serious and organised crime are generally one step ahead of most people \u2013 and they\u2019ve got more money than anyone defending it has.\u201d A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cPrisons were left in crisis by the last government and figures like these demonstrate the need for robust action to get the situation back under control. \u201cStaff have worked hard with the police to stop drones and bring those criminals responsible to justice. But it is clear we must do more and we will announce further measures in due course so that prisons make better citizens, not better criminals.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 October 2024 because an earlier version referred to kettle filaments, rather than elements.

It comes a week after the Briton crashed during qualifying in Austin.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Mercedes driver was taken to the medical centre and the 90-minute session \u2013 an hour of which was devoted to Pirelli tyre testing for 2025 \u2013 was red-flagged for 24 minutes. Mercedes later confirmed Russell had been released from the medical centre and was OK.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Verstappen complained of an engine problem during Friday's opening running in Mexico City but the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, said between the sessions that the team believed it was a 'menial issue'.

Sainz topped the charts ahead of Oscar Piastri and Yuki Tsunoda.<br></p>\n    <p>Later, it was confirmed that McLaren had failed in their bid to overturn Lando Norris' penalty from the US Grand Prix. The team invoked a 'right of review', asking the stewards to look again at the turn 12 incident in Austin, where Norris was handed a five-second penalty for leaving the track while overtaking Max Verstappen in the closing stages.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>That demoted the British driver below his title rival as the Dutchman extended his championship lead to 57 points. Earlier this week, Norris repeated his view that the penalty was unfair and said he believes Verstappen, who also left the track, was only ahead because he braked late and had no intention of making the corner.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>McLaren felt they had 'a significant and new element that was unavailable to us at the time the decision was made' \u2013 but the FIA rejected their claim after a video meeting with stewards as there was no 'relevant new element'.<b> PA Media</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At his best Alonso is mesmerising, a force of nature with tremendous pace and intuitive race craft.

It is the Accredited Registers programme run by the Professional Standards Authority (PSA). Therapy organisations can apply to have their own registers accredited by the PSA, which involves meeting and maintaining rigorous governance standards in which public protection is prioritised. </p> <p>Any therapist on such a register has been properly trained, is subject to professional and ethical codes of practice and a robust complaints procedure is available to their clients. Registrants of a PSA-accredited register will display the PSA logo in their publicity.</p> <p>As this is voluntary regulation, it does not prevent anyone calling themselves a psychotherapist or counsellor. Only statutory regulation would protect the title. Many counsellors and psychotherapists would like to have their title protected, but not if it means the rich variety of therapeutic approaches, many of which are non-medical and not available from the NHS, get excluded in pursuit of the standardisation and manualisation that makes statutory regulation easier to implement. </p> <p>The last Labour government in 2010 attempted to impose such a prescriptive statutory regulation of counselling and psychotherapy under the then Health Professions Council. It did not survive the first legal challenge brought by members of the profession. The current government should learn from this. </p> <p>Any future statutory regulation needs to embrace and protect the diversity of therapeutic approaches, especially those outside the medical paradigm, that psychotherapy offers while ensuring optimum public protection. This will only be achieved through a constructive collaboration between government&nbsp;and the psychotherapeutic professions.<br><strong> John Fletcher</strong><br><em> London</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

Allison Alexander Brighton \u2022 A robust system of regulating therapists has been in place since 2012. It is the Accredited Registers programme run by the Professional Standards Authority (PSA). Therapy organisations can apply to have their own registers accredited by the PSA, which involves meeting and maintaining rigorous governance standards in which public protection is prioritised. Any therapist on such a register has been properly trained, is subject to professional and ethical codes of practice and a robust complaints procedure is available to their clients. Registrants of a PSA-accredited register will display the PSA logo in their publicity. As this is voluntary regulation, it does not prevent anyone calling themselves a psychotherapist or counsellor. Only statutory regulation would protect the title. Many counsellors and psychotherapists would like to have their title protected, but not if it means the rich variety of therapeutic approaches, many of which are non-medical and not available from the NHS, get excluded in pursuit of the standardisation and manualisation that makes statutory regulation easier to implement. The last Labour government in 2010 attempted to impose such a prescriptive statutory regulation of counselling and psychotherapy under the then Health Professions Council. It did not survive the first legal challenge brought by members of the profession. The current government should learn from this. Any future statutory regulation needs to embrace and protect the diversity of therapeutic approaches, especially those outside the medical paradigm, that psychotherapy offers while ensuring optimum public protection. This will only be achieved through a constructive collaboration between government and the psychotherapeutic professions.

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time there was a football match. They called it el cl\u00e1sico and it was a classic every time, the biggest and best in the whole wide world. Everyone watched it and everything depended on it, so the story goes. It was built up and up and up and still never let you down, an epic battle between two behemoths who went 17 years without a 0-0, going all the way back to the night a pig\u2019s head was thrown at Lu\u00eds Figo, and who scored a combined 125 goals in a decade. Barcelona and Real Madrid were, after all, the best teams with the best coaches and best players on the planet, matched only by each other. Were? Are? There is no rivalry like Madrid-Bar\u00e7a and that remains the case, a meeting with a scale and symbolism nothing equals, huge every time. There have been special moments recently, too. And this week\u2019s talk of the best cl\u00e1sico they could remember, a recurring theme on radio and TV, points at extremely short memories and invites fate to leave them looking foolish. But Saturday\u2019s meeting does feel a little different; these two might, just might, actually be the best teams in Europe again; this could be a battle the way it used to be, closer and more competitive than anyone anticipated. A clash of styles and identities. Above all, a clash of titans. Madrid already were, of course. Champions League winners in two of the last three seasons, six of the last 11. But this is about both of them, about competition, the elite, and it is nine years since Barcelona won in Europe, traumas adding up and the distance between these rivals seeming to as well: in 2018 they fell in Rome, in 2019 at Anfield and in 2020 they were beaten 8-2 by Bayern Munich, the final humiliation. Lionel Messi left, an era ending. They won La Liga in 2023, a feat a little too quickly forgotten, but have been dumped into the Europa League and then dumped out of it again more than once. This, it seemed, was their reality. A certain dignity was restored last season when they defeated Napoli, Xavi saying: \u201cWe were the buffoon of the Champions League \u2026 so now what?\u201d Yet defeat against Paris Saint-Germain followed, a superb documentary following Luis Enrique recently revealing the coach saying his former club \u201cplay like Eibar\u201d, and Madrid\u2019s closest challengers for a league they ultimately won by 10 points last season were actually Girona.

Cheltenham 1.45 Millforce\u2019s hurdling left a lot to be desired at Cork last time but he is still the most unexposed runner in this field and should return to winning form if he can start to cut out the errors. Doncaster 2.05 Last year\u2019s winner Aberama Gold is 11lb lower in the weights this time around, goes well with cut in the ground and looked to be coming to the boil at Catterick last week. Cheltenham 2.20 After a progressive novice season over fences last year, Some Scope was a close-up fourth at this track in April and he remains on a workable mark for his second chasing campaign. Cheltenham 2.55 Lucy Wadham\u2019s Zain Nights is a tough horse for the handicapper to get a grip on as he always just does enough, and he could register a fifth win in his last six starts here.

A longtime female friend, who worked as an education expert, told the court that Patrice N had always been a \u201cteddy bear\u201d, \u201cwasn\u2019t even a skirt-chaser\u201d and wasn\u2019t the type to rape. A care-worker, who 16 months ago became Patrice N\u2019s girlfriend despite knowing he was charged with rape in the Pelicot case, said: \u201cHe treats me like a princess.\u201d</p> \n<p>Three accused men in court this week did take the rare step of admitting rape, saying they knew Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had been drugged and was unconscious.</p> \n<p>Abdelali D, 47, a former canteen worker who had suffered a stroke since his arrest, said he went to the Pelicots\u2019 home twice and raped Gis\u00e8le Pelicot when she was in a comatose state. The first time, one January night in 2018, he had asked his then girlfriend to drive him to the Pelicots\u2019 village and wait an hour for him in the car. She told the court she had driven him because she was worried about him driving drunk. She thought he was meeting a couple for a sexual encounter, but had not sought details. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Taking the stand in France\u2019s biggest ever rape trial, Patrice N, 55, an electrician from the southern town of Carpentras, said he was a \u201cjovial\u201d guy and a fun dad who once trained youth football teams and had a \u201cgreat respect for women\u201d. He denied the charges of rape, claiming rape had never been his intention. \u201cTo my mind, it was a game,\u201d he told the court. Patrice N is one of 51 men on trial for the alleged rape and assault of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, a former logistics manager, who has become a feminist hero for insisting the trial should be held in public. For a nine-year period from 2011 to 2020, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was unknowingly sedated and raped by her former husband, Dominique Pelicot, who crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into her food and invited men to rape her at their home in the picturesque village of Mazan in Provence. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot told the court this week that she felt \u201cdestroyed\u201d but was driven by \u201cthe determination to change society\u201d and expose \u201crape culture\u201d. After dozens of accused men have testified that they did not think what happened was rape, her lawyers said the court hearings have exposed a \u201cprofound problem\u201d in society\u2019s attitudes to sexual violence. Despite video evidence in court showing Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in an unconscious state, snoring loudly, Patrice N claimed he had not noticed that she was sedated on the Monday night in February 2020 when he drove 20 minutes to the couples\u2019 home after he he had been in contact with Dominique Pelicot online. Dominique Pelicot ushered Patrice N into the bedroom, where he stayed for about one hour with the lights on. It was only at the end of the visit, when he said, \u201cYour wife looks like she\u2019s really asleep\u201d, that Dominique Pelicot said he gave his wife \u201cpills\u201d. Patrice N said he asked if this happened often, to which Dominique Pelicot replied that after drugging his wife, he would also take her to motorway laybys and \u201chand her to men\u201d. Patrice N said: \u201cI told him he was sick, I walked round the bed and left straight away \u2026 He didn\u2019t even text me to see if I got home OK.\u201d One of the judges asked Patrice N: \u201cYou heard him say he delivered his drugged wife to men in laybys, but you did nothing to help her, you didn\u2019t report it?\u201d He said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to waste my time at the police station. I\u2019m a humble neighbourhood electrician. If I went to the police and said she\u2019s unconscious, who would have believed me?\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, watched from her seat in court, and shook her head. From the dock, Dominique Pelicot told the court that he did not hand his then wife to men at roadsides, but had once drugged and raped her himself in a motorway layby on the way back from their daughter\u2019s holiday home. Patrice N, like several other men accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, was supported in court by a number of women who knew him who said they didn\u2019t think him capable of rape. A longtime female friend, who worked as an education expert, told the court that Patrice N had always been a \u201cteddy bear\u201d, \u201cwasn\u2019t even a skirt-chaser\u201d and wasn\u2019t the type to rape. A care-worker, who 16 months ago became Patrice N\u2019s girlfriend despite knowing he was charged with rape in the Pelicot case, said: \u201cHe treats me like a princess.\u201d Three accused men in court this week did take the rare step of admitting rape, saying they knew Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had been drugged and was unconscious. Abdelali D, 47, a former canteen worker who had suffered a stroke since his arrest, said he went to the Pelicots\u2019 home twice and raped Gis\u00e8le Pelicot when she was in a comatose state. The first time, one January night in 2018, he had asked his then girlfriend to drive him to the Pelicots\u2019 village and wait an hour for him in the car. She told the court she had driven him because she was worried about him driving drunk. She thought he was meeting a couple for a sexual encounter, but had not sought details. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said. She described Abdelali D as someone who \u201cdrank morning, noon and night\u201d. Jean-Luc L, 46, a mirror-maker, admitted raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on two occasions in 2018 and 2019 while she was unconscious. He had at first thought that because her husband had consented for her, \u201cit wasn\u2019t against the law\u201d. He told a psychologist after his arrest that the definition of rape was instead something that \u201chappens in the street\u201d in the style of \u201cif you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll hit you\u201d. But in court, he admitted raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her own bedroom. The court heard Jean-Luc L had fled Vietnam by boat with his mother as a child and had lived in refugee camps before coming to France. His second wife, of 10 years, and the mother of his two youngest children, was also Vietnamese. Through an interpreter, she told the court that because her own mother was ill at the time, she had not wanted sex with her husband. Asked how she felt when she learned of the rape charges against her husband, she said in a soft voice: \u201cI was very sad, in shock.

Skin smooth as a dewdrop. She came to America from Vietnam, and attributes her youthful complexion to rarely, if ever, eating out at restaurants: not on birthdays, anniversaries or other special occasions.</p> <p>\u201cShe was always telling me: \u2018Don\u2019t ever eat out, eating out is super bad for you,\u2019\u201d says Davenport on the other end of a Zoom call. \u201cSo we always had to cook at home. And when she did cook, it was always water-based: steamed meat, stews and lots of vegetables.\u201d</p> <p>Davenport, 39, is a scientist and registered dietician based in San Francisco whose work focuses on slowing the deleterious effects of ageing. She argues that this can be accomplished by cooking mostly with broth and water. On <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9fQxsQPGEl/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">her Instagram page</a>, which has nearly 200,000 followers, you\u2019ll find recipes for dishes like collagen-rich oxtail ph\u1edf, green curry salmon, steamed eggs and g\u00e0 h\u1ea3i nam (the Vietnamese version of Hainan chicken, a recipe passed down directly from Grandma).</p> <p>Cooking this way, she says, mitigates the creation of advanced glycation end products, or AGEs, formed when food is cooked at high dry temperatures, like over the grill or in an air fryer.</p>    <p>Davenport remembers her eureka moment clearly. In 2012, she was pursuing her PhD in nutrition at New York University. \u201cLike a lot of Asian families, I have a lot of family members that have histories of diabetes, mostly on my mom\u2019s side,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I was always really interested. It\u2019s what I wanted to study.\u201d</p> <p>In one class, a professor very casually said something that altered the course of her career: \u201cEveryone knows that AGEs in processed western foods are killing us.\u201d Davenport bolted up in her seat: \u201cI was like, um, what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had never heard anything like that. And then \u2026 he never said anything else about it again,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cBut I started digging into the topic and I was like: \u2018Oh my God. How is no one talking about this?\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>What are AGEs?</h2> <p>Advanced glycation end products are a group of compounds created when proteins or lipids are exposed to sugars. People encounter them regularly in the western diet, where they are typically generated during the cooking process via the Maillard reaction, or when food is blasted over high heat. (Think: the crust on a good steak.) A lot of ultra-processed foods, like cheese puffs and breakfast cereals, are also cooked this way.</p> <p>Once in the body, AGEs do one of two things. They can crosslink with a protein, which causes plaque buildup in the body \u2013 this can clog arteries and reduce healthy blood flow. Or they create inflammation through receptor binding. It\u2019s why researchers consider AGEs a powerful biomarker for oxidative stress, which causes cell and tissue damage, and inflammation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, \u2018Well Actually\u2019, then \u2018Read more on living a good life in a complex world,\u2019 then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say \u2018More from this section\u2019\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>During the past decade, there has quietly been an abundance of <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6600625/\">scientific</a> <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circulationaha.106.621854\">literature</a> suggesting that AGEs are the common denominator for a lot of modern health woes. \u201cWe and others have demonstrated that a diet high in AGEs is associated with the development of many chronic non-transmissible diseases, which are a plague in the modern western world,\u201d explains Dr Jaime Uribarri, a nephrologist and researcher at Mount Sinai, \u201cincluding insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, dementia and cancer\u201d.</p> <p>Davenport ended up writing her NYU dissertation on the topic (Uribarri was one of her advisers) and quickly realized that certain kinds of Asian cooking methods \u2013 like the recipes her grandmother taught her \u2013 were well-suited for minimizing AGE levels. \u201cBasically, AGEs are responsible for total body ageing,\u201d says Davenport, \u201cbut it\u2019s crazy that it all comes down to these compounds that are so easily preventable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost negative effects of so-called ultra-processed foods are related to their content in AGEs,\u201d Uribarri says. Introducing an AGE-restricted diet, \u201cessentially obtained by changing the culinary technique rather than the content of foods\u201d, has been shown to <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3704564/\">help</a> with many of the biomarkers of disease.</p> <h2>How to minimize AGEs</h2> <p>As Davenport tells it, there are two main ways to dramatically reduce the amount of AGEs in food.</p> <p>The first is using water and broth to cook, which inhibits the Maillard reaction. \u201cWhile chefs are trying to get everything as dry as possible to get that sear, I do the opposite,\u201d says Davenport.</p> <p>The second method is to use acid for marinades \u2013 particularly in meat. \u201cI mean, sometimes I want grilled food,\u201d Davenport says. \u201cLike on the Fourth of July, I wasn\u2019t going to be eating soup.\u201d</p> <p>So, if you\u2019re going to throw meat on the grill, \u201cstudies show that even if you just marinate for 15 minutes, it\u2019s still a significant reduction in the amount of AGEs\u201d, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple fix.\u201d One of Davenport\u2019s most popular recipes, for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C6kD1ngyyW9/\">steak with chimichurri sauce</a>, uses this technique.</p> <p>Davenport, who founded <a href=\"https://time.com/5113198/michelle-davenport-raised-real-baby-food-delivery/\">a food startup</a> focused on healthy children\u2019s meals, then sold it in 2019, decided to start posting recipes designed to minimize AGEs on Instagram.

I won\u2019t watch them because I know what will happen to me if I do: some combination of passing out, vomiting or passing out while vomiting.</p> <p>I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/oct/21/the-guide-banshees-of-inisherin-gore-on-screen\">written about my squeamishness before</a> in this newsletter, and while I\u2019ve largely gotten over my ashen-faced teenage years, there are still a few offerings at the sharp end of the horror genre that are likely to send me a-tumbling. And the ultraviolent Terrifier 3, <a href=\"https://terrifier3.com/wp-content/uploads/terrifier3-beast-within-full.jpg\">which proudly flaunts</a> its capacity to have audiences sprinting back up the aisles within the first 10 minutes, definitely comes under that heading.</p> <p>However, while I haven\u2019t seen the grisly goings-on in Terrifier 3, I have read all about them \u2026 on the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27911000/parentalguide/\">IMDb\u2019s Parents Guide page</a> for the film.

However, while I haven\u2019t seen the grisly goings-on in Terrifier 3, I have read all about them \u2026 on the IMDb\u2019s Parents Guide page for the film.

Thank you for reading it and for the comments below the line today. You can keep up to date with the Guardian\u2019s UK politics reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics\">here</a>.</p> <p>Here is a summary of the latest developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Keir Starmer does not think all owners of stocks and shares fall outside his definition of \u201cworking people\u201d, Downing Street has signalled, amid confusion over who will be protected from tax rises in next week\u2019s budget. </strong>The prime minister had suggested asset owners would not fall within his conception of what a working person is. The government has been asked repeatedly to define this term, in a bid to establish which taxes may rise in the budget.</p></li> <li><p><strong>On Friday morning, a Treasury minister said it was \u201cimportant to focus on\u201d where people are getting their money from in relation to the debate over the \u201cworking people\u201d definition. </strong>James Murray told Sky News that \u201ca working person is someone who goes out to work and who gets their income from work\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Starmer has said he understands the \u201cstrength of feeling\u201d in the Commonwealth about reparatory justice but that countries should work together to ensure their future is \u201cnot in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it\u201d. </strong>Speaking in an executive session of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) hosted in Samoa, the prime minister conceded that the Commonwealth had to \u201cacknowledge our shared history \u2013 especially when it\u2019s hard\u201d. Downing Street has firmly ruled out paying reparations to its former colonies and said it\u2019s not on the agenda for the summit, but Caribbean countries have been pushing for them to be mentioned in the communique.</p></li> <li><p><strong>On the subject of slavery reparations, Downing Street has said that its position on reparations also covers non-financial reparations. </strong>The prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson said: \u201cOur position on reparations is clear, and that goes for other forms of non-financial reparatory justice too. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s focus is on addressing the challenges that we face.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said the UK should \u201cunequivocally reject\u201d claims of reparations</strong>. He said in a speech at the Henry Jackson Society: \u201cWe must unequivocally reject these claims, they are based on false and misleading narratives about our past, after all it was Britain that worked harder than nearly any other country to eradicate the slave trade.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Jenrick has said the contest is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d over after a survey by ConservativeHome suggested he was trailing Kemi Badenoch by 31% to 55%</strong>. Asked whether the contest was all over, Jenrick said: \u201cAbsolutely not \u2013 this is neck and neck, that\u2019s a survey not a poll.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Downing Street will announce five new freeports in next week\u2019s budget as part of its effort to drive economic growth. </strong>Ministers will set out plans to establish five new low-tax zones, plus an investment zone in the East Midlands, where businesses will benefit from tax breaks such as lower tariffs and customs. Starmer said the freeports being announced next week would \u201chave this government\u2019s stamp on them\u201d despite being a policy inherited from the Tories.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Rachel Reeves must \u201cget the balance right\u201d when announcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/23/reeves-to-announce-major-change-to-fiscal-rules-releasing-50bn-for-spending\">changes to Britain\u2019s debt rules</a> in next week\u2019s budget given the potential knock-on effects to borrowing and mortgage rates, the boss of NatWest has warned. </strong>The bank\u2019s chief executive, Paul Thwaite, said markets would be sensitive to the chancellor\u2019s reasons for releasing up to \u00a350bn of borrowing headroom after she<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/23/reeves-to-announce-major-change-to-fiscal-rules-releasing-50bn-for-spending\"> confirmed in Washington on Thursday</a> that she planned to rewrite her fiscal rules.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The value of the UK\u2019s private healthcare market rose to a record \u00a312.4bn last year as long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> waiting lists fuelled demand from individuals and the health service paid for nearly \u00a33.5bn of procedures to help ease the care backlog. </strong>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/18/uk-private-health-insurance-market-nhs-crisis-dental-cover\">private medical insurance boomed</a>, total revenues generated in the independent healthcare sector hit an all-time high in real terms pegged to 2003 prices, research revealed.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, has been charged with failing to provide the pin to his mobile phone under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, Kent police said. </strong>The charge is in relation to an incident in Folkestone on Sunday 28 July after officers stopped Robinson under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Supporters of Robinson are due to hold a demonstration on Saturday, which is expected to be met with a counter-protest from Stand Up to Racism campaigners.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Downing Street is blocking moves to include a ban on smoking outdoors in the upcoming Tobacco and Vapes bill amid fierce opposition by the hospitality trade. </strong>No 10 officials privately believe that banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is \u201can unserious\u201d policy and is not backed by good evidence showing that it harms non-smokers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The SNP will need to make \u201cuncomfortable commitments\u201d to gain the support of the Scottish Greens for the budget, Lorna Slater has said.</strong> The Greens\u2019 co-leader said her party will require the Scottish government to make promises similar to those made in the Bute House agreement (BHA).</p></li> <li><p><strong>AstraZeneca has said it may cut jobs at its UK operation if the government enforces a global push to make companies share profits derived from nature\u2019s genetic codes, multiple sources have told the Guardian. </strong>The alleged<strong> </strong>comments from the company came amid a concerted lobbying push by the pharmaceutical industry against the profit-sharing measures.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Two Scottish pensioners have been given permission to proceed with their legal challenge against the UK and Scottish and governments\u2019 decision to cut the winter fuel payment</strong>. The case\u2019s argument rests on the accusation that both governments failed to adequately consult those of pension age on the change and did not release an equality impact assessment on the changes.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Michelle O\u2019Neill has insisted the powersharing structures in Northern Ireland remain stable after several controversies that have hit Sinn F\u00e9in. </strong>In an effort to draw a line under a difficult month for her party, the first minister said she has spent four weeks answering questions on the various furores but was now keen to focus on the future for the devolved executive she jointly leads with DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The EU executive has said it has failed to reach agreement with the UK government in a dispute over fishing rights and has triggered an arbitration process under the post-Brexit deal.</strong> The European Commission announced on Friday that it was requesting an arbitration tribunal over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/16/uk-may-ban-sandeel-fishing-in-move-to-save-threatened-seabirds\">UK\u2019s decision to ban industrial fishing of sandeel in the North Sea.</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>More than 29,000 migrants have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel, including 500 in a single day, Home Office figures show. </strong>On Thursday, 509 people made the journey in 11 boats, taking the provisional total for 2024 to date to 29,154.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A former UK defence chief has warned \u201cdire consequences\u201d would follow if European leaders fail to hold their nerve and continue to support Ukraine. </strong>Jock Stirrup, who served as head of the armed forces between 2006 and 2010, acknowledged there are \u201csigns of growing war weariness\u201d and a desire to end the conflict whatever it takes. Speaking during a House of Lords debate, Lord Stirrup said it has been a \u201cdifficult\u201d year for Ukraine as weapons and personnel shortages are \u201champering\u201d its efforts to deal with the \u201cgrinding war of attrition\u201d pursued by Russia. When opening the debate, defence minister Vernon Coaker, reiterated the UK government\u2019s support for Ukraine as he said Russia\u2019s war represented a \u201csustained attack\u201d on the United Nations charter and the rules and norms that underpin security and prosperity.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Businesses that import critical minerals to the UK will be given access to state-backed loans in

governments\u2019 decision to cut the winter fuel payment, reports the PA news agency.</p> <p>The decision by the court of session means the challenge, brought by <strong>Peter and Florence Fanning</strong>, of Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, will now proceed to a procedural hearing in December ahead of a full \u201csubstantive\u201d hearing in January.</p> <p>The proceedings were raised with the help of the <strong>Govan Law Centre</strong> against the Scottish government and the UK work and pensions secretary after the move to end universal entitlement to the payment.</p> <p>The decision, which was announced by chancellor, <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>, following Labour\u2019s election win, led to the Scottish government \u2013 which was due to take control over a similar payment through the devolved Social Security Scotland but has since announced a delay \u2013 to follow suit.</p> <p>According to the PA news agency, the case asks the court to rule whether the decision was unlawful, which would then allow the petitioners to ask the court to, in effect, set aside the policy and restore the winter fuel payment to all.</p> <p>Govan Law Centre said the permission to proceed, which was granted by <strong>Lady Hood</strong> in Edinburgh on Thursday, means the case has been assessed as having \u201ca real prospect of success\u201d in terms the applicable legislation.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Govan Law Centre said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our clients are delighted that the court has granted permission for their judicial review challenge to proceed to a full hearing in early January.</p> <p>We await a decision on civil legal aid from the Scottish Legal Aid Board early next week in relation to the proceedings.</p> <p>If civil legal aid is granted we will then submit an urgent application for sanction for the employment of both junior and senior counsel and will announce our final legal team in early course.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The case\u2019s argument rests on the accusation that both governments failed to adequately consult those of pension age on the change and did not release an equality impact assessment on the changes.</p> <p>The PA news agency reports that a freedom of information request revealed an abridged version of such an assessment had been carried out by the <strong>Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)</strong>, with the UK government arguing a full study was not required.</p> <p>The Fannings\u2019 legal action was launched in September with the support of former first minster and Alba party leader <strong>Alex Salmond</strong>, who died on 12 October.</p> <p>The UK and Scottish governments were asked for comment by the PA news agency.</p> </div>   <p

class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The SNP will need to make \u201cuncomfortable commitments\u201d to gain the support of the Scottish Greens for the budget, <strong>Lorna Slater</strong> has said. </p> <p>According to the PA news agency, the Greens\u2019 co-leader said her party will require the Scottish government to make promises similar to those made in the <strong>Bute House agreement (BHA)</strong>. </p> <p>The BHA was struck between the two parties after the 2021 Holyrood election by then first minister <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Slater and her fellow Green co-leader <strong>Patrick Harvie</strong>. The deal saw Slater and Harvie join the government as ministers as agreement was reached across a raft of progressive policies. Those included commitments on rent controls and reforming the <strong>Gender Recognition Act</strong> to make it easier for trans people to change their legally recognised sex. </p> <p>Speaking to the PA news agency on Friday ahead of the Scottish Greens\u2019 conference in Greenock at the weekend, Slater said her party is willing to work with the government on its budget. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re willing to go into negotiations on the budget with an open mind,\u201d she said, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But we need to be clear about what we need to see in that budget, and it\u2019s going to be the same kind of commitments that we saw under the Bute House agreement.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Slater said she wants to see a \u201cclear focus\u201d on the climate emergency and poverty. \u201cThat means the SNP need to commit to doing some things which may be uncomfortable for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThings like putting in place some taxes to support local authorities, things like the cruise ship levy.\u201d </p> <p>The BHA ended earlier this year and then first minister <strong>Humza Yousaf</strong> sacked Slater and Harvie from his government in a move which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/29/humza-yousaf-quits-as-first-minister-of-scotland-what-happens-now\">ultimately led to his own resignation</a>.</p> <p>The SNP failed to return a majority of MSPs in 2021 and relied on the Greens to form a majority. Since the BHA collapsed, the SNP has governed as a minority and it means each vote requires support from one of the opposition parties. </p> <p>Also speaking on Friday, Harvie said the government must use \u201cevery lever possible\u201d to protect public services in the upcoming budget, \u201cincluding improvements to the tax system\u201d. </p> <p>The Greens have proposed a number of taxes targeting the wealthy, including on private jets and mansions. Income tax is already higher in Scotland than elsewhere in the UK, with changes made by the Scottish government meaning anyone who earns over \u00a328,000 will begin to pay more tax than those south of the border. </p> <p>Harvie told the PA news agency: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve made good progress on having a fairer tax system in terms of income so that the wealthiest, the highest earners, are paying their fair share, and people on low and middle incomes are protected. </p> <p>But we need to broaden that approach and make sure that we\u2019re doing everything possible to protect public services.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Finance secretary <strong>Shona Robison</strong> will unveil her budget on 4 December. She has warned finances are tight, having already announced up to \u00a3500m worth of cuts to public services in the summer. </p> <p>Chancellor <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> will deliver the UK budget on 30 October. </p> <p>The Scottish government has been approached for comment by the PA news agency.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-671ba9d28f08d3f94c2b9b33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gwyntopham\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T14:24:48.582Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While the chancellor, <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>, grapples with the parlous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/16/rachel-reeves-tax-rises-spending-cuts-budget\">\u00a340bn funding gap</a> in Britain\u2019s finances, another \u00a325bn of annual revenue is revving up to disappear into the sunset.</p> <p>As the Treasury knows all too well, turning cars electric will spell the end of that great money-spinner fuel duty. But no one appears ready to grab the wheel and tax motoring in a different way.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/will-road-pricing-answer-the-uks-net-zero-car-tax-conundrum\">Road pricing</a> was the future, once, and <strong>Tony Blair,</strong> its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/feb/21/immigrationpolicy.transport\">last champion in Downing Street</a>, is back via his <strong>TBI</strong> thinktank to push it again. Proponents of road pricing \u2013 or metering, charging, pay-per-mile \u2013 have traditionally been driven by two impulses: managing road congestion, and raising revenue fairly from motoring. The former most concerned the last Labour government; the latter has become a clear and present danger for the Treasury.</p> <p>That \u00a325bn from fuel duty, levied on petrol and diesel at the pumps, more or less covers the entire cost of Britain\u2019s road and railway system. Electric cars, which pay zero fuel duty, make up almost a fifth of new registrations.</p> <p>The TBI is the latest group to weigh in ahead of Reeves\u2019 30 October budget, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/23/pay-per-mile-road-pricing-system-tony-blair-thinktank\">urging her to introduce a road charge</a> of 1p per mile for cars and vans, and 2.5p to 4p for lorries and HGVs \u2013 \u201ca crucial step in reforming motoring taxation for the electric-vehicle era [and] preventing a growth-stifling rise in congestion\u201d.</p> <p>It follows the <strong>Campaign for Better Transport</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/sep/03/uk-electric-car-drivers-per-mile-vehicle-taxes-campaign-for-better-transport\">suggests pay-per-mile charges</a> initially for electric vehicles only. A host of other groups, including the <strong>RAC</strong>, have also declared the need for similar reform. The head of the <strong>National Infrastructure Commission</strong>, <strong>Sir John Armitt</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/10/uk-road-pricing-infrastructure-electric-vehicles-35bn-tax-shortfall\">said road pricing was \u201cinevitable\u201d</a>.</p> <p>But is it? Motorists have got used to being treated with kid gloves come budget time. Since 2010, Conservative chancellors have made great play of freezing fuel duty instead of supposedly scheduled rises \u2013 with <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>\u2019s temporary 5p cut in 2022 leaving it at 52.9p \u2013 to much acclaim from the rightwing press, for whom fuel duty and protecting the interests of the \u201cwhite-van man\u201d has become a totemic issue.</p> <p>Inflationary rises \u2013 the kind applied to rail fares \u2013 would have pushed duty past \u00a31 per litre, netting the exchequer at least \u00a320bn a year more today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/25/with-fuel-duty-revenue-set-to-fall-is-it-time-for-the-uk-to-introduce-road-pricing\">With fuel duty revenue set to fall, is it time for the UK to introduce road pricing?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-671ba6838f085a58218124de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterwalker\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T14:10:02.124Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is a phrase that crops up 21 times in the <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Labour-Party-manifesto-2024.pdf\">Labour manifesto</a>, 12 times in the <a href=\"https://public.conservatives.com/static/documents/GE2024/Conservative-Manifesto-GE2024.pdf\">Conservative manifesto</a>, and has been <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/search?startDate=2014-10-25&amp;endDate=2024-10-25&amp;searchTerm=%22working%20people%22&amp;house=Commons&amp;partial=False&amp;sortOrder=1\">used in the House of Commons</a> more than 3,500 times in the last decade.

But above all else <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> pledged to build a society where poverty would no longer exist by creating a safety net to ensure the most vulnerable, children and unemployed, sick, elderly or disabled people, were no longer at risk.</p> <p>To achieve all this, the postwar Labour government introduced the most progressive, civilising innovation in our country\u2019s history, the welfare state, funded by a redistributive system of taxation.

The appearance of North Korean soldiers in the conflict and the widening of the pool of prisoners, which Russia seeks to recruit soldiers from for the frontline underscores the difficulties that Putin is facing.</p> <p>The FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) assesses that these difficulties will reach crisis proportions by the end of 2025/beginning of 2026. The question then is how Ukraine is to stay in the fight until then.</p> <p>But for Ukraine to stay in the fight, Europe and ideally the United States must stay in the fight.

measured in her first budget.</p> <p>During a round of broadcast interviews while attending the <strong>International Monetary Fund</strong> meeting in <strong>Washington DC</strong>, <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> said she faced difficult choices but insisted her budget would \u201cbegin to fix the NHS and start to rebuild our economy\u201d, reports the PA news agency.</p> <p>The cost of government borrowing increased in response to speculation the chancellor would change debt rules to spend billions more on investments.</p> <p>Tory former chancellor <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> said increased borrowing could increase the cost of mortgages for hundreds of thousands of households.</p> <p>Reeves confirmed a technical change in the way she would measure progress against the target of managing debt. Writing in the Financial Times, Reeves said her fiscal rules would be \u201cthe rock of stability at the core of my budget\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s 2024 election manifesto said Reeves would follow two rules: the current budget would be in balance so that day-to-day costs are met by revenues; the second rule is that debt must be falling as a share of the economy by the fifth year of the economic forecast.</p> <p>On Thursday she confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/24/budget-will-reverse-huge-cuts-in-uks-public-investment-reeves-confirms\">the way debt is measured as part of that target would be changed</a> to allow greater flexibility.</p> <p>According to the PA news agency, Reeves said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My fiscal rules will do two things. The first and most important: my stability rule will mean that day-to-day spending will be matched by revenues. Given the state of the public finances and the need to invest in our public services, this rule will bite hardest.</p> <p>Alongside tough decisions on spending and welfare, that means taxes will need to rise to ensure this rule is met. I will always protect working people when I make these choices, while taking a balanced approach.</p> <p>Crucially, my stability rule will also cover the interest on our national debt and unlike the previous government I won\u2019t cut capital budgets to make up for shortfalls in the day-to-day running costs of departments.</p> <p>My second fiscal rule, the investment rule, will get debt falling as a proportion of our economy.

      "bodyText": "This blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for reading it and for the comments below the line today. You can keep up to date with the Guardian\u2019s UK politics reporting here. Here is a summary of the latest developments: Keir Starmer does not think all owners of stocks and shares fall outside his definition of \u201cworking people\u201d, Downing Street has signalled, amid confusion over who will be protected from tax rises in next week\u2019s budget. The prime minister had suggested asset owners would not fall within his conception of what a working person is. The government has been asked repeatedly to define this term, in a bid to establish which taxes may rise in the budget. On Friday morning, a Treasury minister said it was \u201cimportant to focus on\u201d where people are getting their money from in relation to the debate over the \u201cworking people\u201d definition. James Murray told Sky News that \u201ca working person is someone who goes out to work and who gets their income from work\u201d. Starmer has said he understands the \u201cstrength of feeling\u201d in the Commonwealth about reparatory justice but that countries should work together to ensure their future is \u201cnot in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it\u201d. Speaking in an executive session of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) hosted in Samoa, the prime minister conceded that the Commonwealth had to \u201cacknowledge our shared history \u2013 especially when it\u2019s hard\u201d. Downing Street has firmly ruled out paying reparations to its former colonies and said it\u2019s not on the agenda for the summit, but Caribbean countries have been pushing for them to be mentioned in the communique. On the subject of slavery reparations, Downing Street has said that its position on reparations also covers non-financial reparations. The prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson said: \u201cOur position on reparations is clear, and that goes for other forms of non-financial reparatory justice too. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s focus is on addressing the challenges that we face. Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said the UK should \u201cunequivocally reject\u201d claims of reparations. He said in a speech at the Henry Jackson Society: \u201cWe must unequivocally reject these claims, they are based on false and misleading narratives about our past, after all it was Britain that worked harder than nearly any other country to eradicate the slave trade.\u201d Jenrick has said the contest is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d over after a survey by ConservativeHome suggested he was trailing Kemi Badenoch by 31% to 55%. Asked whether the contest was all over, Jenrick said: \u201cAbsolutely not \u2013 this is neck and neck, that\u2019s a survey not a poll.\u201d Downing Street will announce five new freeports in next week\u2019s budget as part of its effort to drive economic growth. Ministers will set out plans to establish five new low-tax zones, plus an investment zone in the East Midlands, where businesses will benefit from tax breaks such as lower tariffs and customs. Starmer said the freeports being announced next week would \u201chave this government\u2019s stamp on them\u201d despite being a policy inherited from the Tories. Rachel Reeves must \u201cget the balance right\u201d when announcing changes to Britain\u2019s debt rules in next week\u2019s budget given the potential knock-on effects to borrowing and mortgage rates, the boss of NatWest has warned. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Paul Thwaite, said markets would be sensitive to the chancellor\u2019s reasons for releasing up to \u00a350bn of borrowing headroom after she confirmed in Washington on Thursday that she planned to rewrite her fiscal rules. The value of the UK\u2019s private healthcare market rose to a record \u00a312.4bn last year as long NHS waiting lists fuelled demand from individuals and the health service paid for nearly \u00a33.5bn of procedures to help ease the care backlog. As private medical insurance boomed, total revenues generated in the independent healthcare sector hit an all-time high in real terms pegged to 2003 prices, research revealed. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, has been charged with failing to provide the pin to his mobile phone under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, Kent police said. The charge is in relation to an incident in Folkestone on Sunday 28 July after officers stopped Robinson under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Supporters of Robinson are due to hold a demonstration on Saturday, which is expected to be met with a counter-protest from Stand Up to Racism campaigners. Downing Street is blocking moves to include a ban on smoking outdoors in the upcoming Tobacco and Vapes bill amid fierce opposition by the hospitality trade. No 10 officials privately believe that banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is \u201can unserious\u201d policy and is not backed by good evidence showing that it harms non-smokers. The SNP will need to make \u201cuncomfortable commitments\u201d to gain the support of the Scottish Greens for the budget, Lorna Slater has said. The Greens\u2019 co-leader said her party will require the Scottish government to make promises similar to those made in the Bute House agreement (BHA). AstraZeneca has said it may cut jobs at its UK operation if the government enforces a global push to make companies share profits derived from nature\u2019s genetic codes, multiple sources have told the Guardian. The alleged comments from the company came amid a concerted lobbying push by the pharmaceutical industry against the profit-sharing measures. Two Scottish pensioners have been given permission to proceed with their legal challenge against the UK and Scottish and governments\u2019 decision to cut the winter fuel payment. The case\u2019s argument rests on the accusation that both governments failed to adequately consult those of pension age on the change and did not release an equality impact assessment on the changes. Michelle O\u2019Neill has insisted the powersharing structures in Northern Ireland remain stable after several controversies that have hit Sinn F\u00e9in. In an effort to draw a line under a difficult month for her party, the first minister said she has spent four weeks answering questions on the various furores but was now keen to focus on the future for the devolved executive she jointly leads with DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. The EU executive has said it has failed to reach agreement with the UK government in a dispute over fishing rights and has triggered an arbitration process under the post-Brexit deal. The European Commission announced on Friday that it was requesting an arbitration tribunal over the UK\u2019s decision to ban industrial fishing of sandeel in the North Sea. More than 29,000 migrants have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel, including 500 in a single day, Home Office figures show. On Thursday, 509 people made the journey in 11 boats, taking the provisional total for 2024 to date to 29,154. A former UK defence chief has warned \u201cdire consequences\u201d would follow if European leaders fail to hold their nerve and continue to support Ukraine. Jock Stirrup, who served as head of the armed forces between 2006 and 2010, acknowledged there are \u201csigns of growing war weariness\u201d and a desire to end the conflict whatever it takes. Speaking during a House of Lords debate, Lord Stirrup said it has been a \u201cdifficult\u201d year for Ukraine as weapons and personnel shortages are \u201champering\u201d its efforts to deal with the \u201cgrinding war of attrition\u201d pursued by Russia. When opening the debate, defence minister Vernon Coaker, reiterated the UK government\u2019s support for Ukraine as he said Russia\u2019s war represented a \u201csustained attack\u201d on the United Nations charter and the rules and norms that underpin security and prosperity. Businesses that import critical minerals to the UK will be given access to state-backed loans in a move to counter China\u2019s dominance in the market. The chancellor is expected to announce extra government support to encourage the import of critical minerals such as lithium, graphite and cobalt in her budget next week. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, has been charged with failing to provide the pin to his mobile phone under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, Kent police said. The charge is in relation to an incident in Folkestone on Sunday 28 July after officers stopped Robinson under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The PA news agency reports that Robinson has been bailed to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 13 November 2024. Supporters of Robinson are due to hold a demonstration on Saturday, which is expected to be met with a counter-protest from Stand Up to Racism campaigners. The Metropolitan police and British Transport Police are due to be supported by officers from other forces across the country as the Met said there will be a \u201csignificant police presence\u201d to ensure the two groups are kept apart. Robinson arrived at Folkestone police station shortly after 3pm on Friday. \u2022 This post was amended on 25 October 2024 as it initially said the counter-protest would be from Stop the War campaigners. Two Scottish pensioners have been given permission to proceed with their legal challenge against the UK and Scottish and governments\u2019 decision to cut the winter fuel payment, reports the PA news agency. The decision by the court of session means the challenge, brought by Peter and Florence Fanning, of Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, will now proceed to a procedural hearing in December ahead of a full \u201csubstantive\u201d hearing in January. The proceedings were raised with the help of the Govan Law Centre against the Scottish government and the UK work and pensions secretary after the move to end universal entitlement to the payment. The decision, which was announced by chancellor, Rachel Reeves, following Labour\u2019s election win, led to the Scottish government \u2013 which was due to take control over a similar payment through the devolved Social Security Scotland but has since announced a delay \u2013 to follow suit. According to the PA news agency, the case asks the court to rule whether the decision was unlawful, which would then allow the petitioners to ask the court to, in effect, set aside the policy and restore the winter fuel payment to all. Govan Law Centre said the permission to proceed, which was granted by Lady Hood in Edinburgh on Thursday, means the case has been assessed as having \u201ca real prospect of success\u201d in terms the applicable legislation. A spokesperson for Govan Law Centre said: Our clients are delighted that the court has granted permission for their judicial review challenge to proceed to a full hearing in early January. We await a decision on civil legal aid from the Scottish Legal Aid Board early next week in relation to the proceedings. If civil legal aid is granted we will then submit an urgent application for sanction for the employment of both junior and senior counsel and will announce our final legal team in early course.\u201d The case\u2019s argument rests on the accusation that both governments failed to adequately consult those of pension age on the change and did not release an equality impact assessment on the changes. The PA news agency reports that a freedom of information request revealed an abridged version of such an assessment had been carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), with the UK government arguing a full study was not required. The Fannings\u2019 legal action was launched in September with the support of former first minster and Alba party leader Alex Salmond, who died on 12 October. The UK and Scottish governments were asked for comment by the PA news agency. The SNP will need to make \u201cuncomfortable commitments\u201d to gain the support of the Scottish Greens for the budget, Lorna Slater has said. According to the PA news agency, the Greens\u2019 co-leader said her party will require the Scottish government to make promises similar to those made in the Bute House agreement (BHA). The BHA was struck between the two parties after the 2021 Holyrood election by then first minister Nicola Sturgeon, Slater and her fellow Green co-leader Patrick Harvie. The deal saw Slater and Harvie join the government as ministers as agreement was reached across a raft of progressive policies. Those included commitments on rent controls and reforming the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for trans people to change their legally recognised sex. Speaking to the PA news agency on Friday ahead of the Scottish Greens\u2019 conference in Greenock at the weekend, Slater said her party is willing to work with the government on its budget. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to go into negotiations on the budget with an open mind,\u201d she said, adding: But we need to be clear about what we need to see in that budget, and it\u2019s going to be the same kind of commitments that we saw under the Bute House agreement.\u201d Slater said she wants to see a \u201cclear focus\u201d on the climate emergency and poverty. \u201cThat means the SNP need to commit to doing some things which may be uncomfortable for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThings like putting in place some taxes to support local authorities, things like the cruise ship levy.\u201d The BHA ended earlier this year and then first minister Humza Yousaf sacked Slater and Harvie from his government in a move which ultimately led to his own resignation. The SNP failed to return a majority of MSPs in 2021 and relied on the Greens to form a majority. Since the BHA collapsed, the SNP has governed as a minority and it means each vote requires support from one of the opposition parties. Also speaking on Friday, Harvie said the government must use \u201cevery lever possible\u201d to protect public services in the upcoming budget, \u201cincluding improvements to the tax system\u201d. The Greens have proposed a number of taxes targeting the wealthy, including on private jets and mansions. Income tax is already higher in Scotland than elsewhere in the UK, with changes made by the Scottish government meaning anyone who earns over \u00a328,000 will begin to pay more tax than those south of the border. Harvie told the PA news agency: We\u2019ve made good progress on having a fairer tax system in terms of income so that the wealthiest, the highest earners, are paying their fair share, and people on low and middle incomes are protected. But we need to broaden that approach and make sure that we\u2019re doing everything possible to protect public services.\u201d Finance secretary Shona Robison will unveil her budget on 4 December. She has warned finances are tight, having already announced up to \u00a3500m worth of cuts to public services in the summer. Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver the UK budget on 30 October. The Scottish government has been approached for comment by the PA news agency. While the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, grapples with the parlous \u00a340bn funding gap in Britain\u2019s finances, another \u00a325bn of annual revenue is revving up to disappear into the sunset. As the Treasury knows all too well, turning cars electric will spell the end of that great money-spinner fuel duty. But no one appears ready to grab the wheel and tax motoring in a different way. Road pricing was the future, once, and Tony Blair, its last champion in Downing Street, is back via his TBI thinktank to push it again. Proponents of road pricing \u2013 or metering, charging, pay-per-mile \u2013 have traditionally been driven by two impulses: managing road congestion, and raising revenue fairly from motoring. The former most concerned the last Labour government; the latter has become a clear and present danger for the Treasury. That \u00a325bn from fuel duty, levied on petrol and diesel at the pumps, more or less covers the entire cost of Britain\u2019s road and railway system. Electric cars, which pay zero fuel duty, make up almost a fifth of new registrations. The TBI is the latest group to weigh in ahead of Reeves\u2019 30 October budget, urging her to introduce a road charge of 1p per mile for cars and vans, and 2.5p to 4p for lorries and HGVs \u2013 \u201ca crucial step in reforming motoring taxation for the electric-vehicle era [and] preventing a growth-stifling rise in congestion\u201d. It follows the Campaign for Better Transport, which suggests pay-per-mile charges initially for electric vehicles only. A host of other groups, including the RAC, have also declared the need for similar reform. The head of the National Infrastructure Commission, Sir John Armitt, said road pricing was \u201cinevitable\u201d. But is it? Motorists have got used to being treated with kid gloves come budget time. Since 2010, Conservative chancellors have made great play of freezing fuel duty instead of supposedly scheduled rises \u2013 with Rishi Sunak\u2019s temporary 5p cut in 2022 leaving it at 52.9p \u2013 to much acclaim from the rightwing press, for whom fuel duty and protecting the interests of the \u201cwhite-van man\u201d has become a totemic issue. Inflationary rises \u2013 the kind applied to rail fares \u2013 would have pushed duty past \u00a31 per litre, netting the exchequer at least \u00a320bn a year more today. It is a phrase that crops up 21 times in the Labour manifesto, 12 times in the Conservative manifesto, and has been used in the House of Commons more than 3,500 times in the last decade. So, surely everyone knows what \u201cworking people\u201d are \u2013 don\u2019t we? Perhaps not. In the buildup to next week\u2019s budget there has been ever-increasing scrutiny and a parallel lack of clarity about what Labour\u2019s manifesto commitment to not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d actually means in practice. While ministers may want to insist that nothing can be given away in advance of a budget, they have faced inevitable questions about what they would view as a working person, often with mixed results. Speaking to broadcasters in Samoa, Keir Starmer said he would not use the term for people who had income from assets such as shares or property. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come within my definition,\u201d he said. Downing Street hastily clarified that the prime minister did not mean people who owned small amounts of, for example, stocks or shares. There was, inevitably, a long round of questions at the subsequent No 10 media briefing about precisely who did fit the definition. Starmer\u2019s spokesperson set this out as \u201cthose who have to rely on their pay packets and do not always have the means to write a cheque, and it is those who are hardest hit by economic instability\u201d. What the PM had been referring to, she added, was \u201cthe broadest sense of who was in his mind\u2019s eye when it comes to the importance of economic stability\u201d \u2013 in other words, to an extent a working person is whoever Starmer sees them as being. Amid this slightly salad-like cascade of words sit two interlocking definitions, the first economic and relatively precise, the other political and notably more woolly. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell has written an opinion piece for the Guardian. In it he says that as she delivers her budget, Rachel Reeves must not forget Labour\u2019s historic mission. Here is a snippet: With the constant drip of stories about possible tax hikes or reinterpretations of the fiscal rules, it\u2019s easy to forget the underlying purpose of any budget. There are two fundamental but straightforward questions to guide a chancellor\u2019s thinking. The first is what society do you want to create? The second is what are the economic measures that will aid its creation? Labour\u2019s historic mission has been to ensure a good standard of living through decent wages, access to health services and education not dependent on what you could pay, and housing you could afford. But above all else Labour pledged to build a society where poverty would no longer exist by creating a safety net to ensure the most vulnerable, children and unemployed, sick, elderly or disabled people, were no longer at risk. To achieve all this, the postwar Labour government introduced the most progressive, civilising innovation in our country\u2019s history, the welfare state, funded by a redistributive system of taxation. Any budget under a Labour government since then should be measured on its contribution to achieving this mission. You can read the full piece here: Thank you all for your contributions and discussion so far. Comments below the line will close at 3pm today. Michelle O\u2019Neill has insisted the powersharing structures in Northern Ireland remain stable after several controversies that have hit Sinn F\u00e9in, reports the PA news agency. In an effort to draw a line under a difficult month for her party, the first minister said she has spent four weeks answering questions on the various furores but was now keen to focus on the future for the devolved executive she jointly leads with DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. \u201cI spent four weeks now answering questions, where I\u2019m focused on now is the business of government,\u201d O\u2019Neill told the BBC. She added: \u201cEmma and I have a lot of work to get through. We\u2019re determined to continue to lead from the front on all the key issues. That\u2019s the job at hand. That\u2019s the job that I\u2019m committed to as first minister.\u201d The PA news agency reports that on a visit to the opening of a new Irish language school in Strabane, Co Tyrone, O\u2019Neill insisted that the institutions at Stormont were \u201cstable\u201d. \u201cGovernment is stable, the executive is stable,\u201d she said, adding: We are there to work together. I believe there\u2019s a collective will across the executive to make politics work here. I believe that\u2019s what the public demand and deserve. I\u2019m determined to lead that executive.\u201d Her comments come a day after the executive office posted a social media video that saw O\u2019Neill and Little-Pengelly speak positively about the potential for the coalition administration. Sinn F\u00e9in has been criticised in recent weeks for its handling of a number of controversies, including that of former press officer Michael McMonagle and ex-senator Niall O Donnghaile. Keir Starmer\u2019s refusal to discuss enslavement reparations has only magnified the issue, writes the Guardian\u2019s community affairs correspondent, Aamna Mohdin. In her analysis piece, Mohdin writes: The government\u2019s current position puts it out of step with a number of UK institutions, such as the Church of England, the University of Glasgow and Lloyds Bank \u2013 as well as the Guardian \u2013 who, in recent years, have not only issued formal apologies but announced proposals for reparatory justice. The insistence on focusing on \u201ccurrent future-facing challenges\u201d such as climate resilience and debt restructuring went down like a lead balloon with legal experts, campaigners and the Caribbean Community (Caricom). Many felt it showed a deep ignorance of what the campaign for reparative justice actually is. Others bristled at the top-down approach to announce what will and will not be discussed at the meeting \u2013 and what they describe as an attempt to shut down meaningful discussions. The furore displays a gap in race and equality policymaking in No 10, which confirmed in its daily press briefing that Starmer does not have a specific race adviser. You can read the full piece here: Conservative former Foreign Office minister Tariq Ahmad acknowledged the \u201cwise words and wisdom\u201d from Jock Stirrup on Ukraine (see 1.34pm BST). According to the PA news agency, during a House of Lords debate Ahmad said: A bit of learning here for ministers: listening to the noble and gallant Lord [Stirrup] was something I found extremely beneficial.\u201d Labour former minister John Spellar, making his maiden speech, said: I also warn, as Lord Stirrup did, against the complacent view that a deal with Putin that allows him to claim victory will end the war. It may end the battle, it will not end the war and we need absolutely to understand that.\u201d The PA news agency reports that when opening the debate, defence minister Vernon Coaker, reiterated the UK government\u2019s support for Ukraine as he said Russia\u2019s war represented a \u201csustained attack\u201d on the United Nations charter and the rules and norms that underpin security and prosperity. He said: That is why Russia must lose and be seen to lose because global security is indivisible. What happens in Ukraine has an impact around the world.\u201d Lord Coaker also told peers: Regardless of who wins the US election, it is pretty clear a new US president will be looking towards European Nato allies to step up and take greater responsibility for European security.\u201d A former UK defence chief has warned \u201cdire consequences\u201d would follow if European leaders fail to hold their nerve and continue to support Ukraine, reports the PA news agency. Jock Stirrup, who served as head of the armed forces between 2006 and 2010, acknowledged there are \u201csigns of growing war weariness\u201d and a desire to end the conflict whatever it takes. But he said this would be a \u201cdisastrous mistake\u201d and make the prospect of a wider war more likely, as he predicted Russian president Vladimir Putin would ultimately ignore any settlement with Ukraine. Western officials earlier this month said they could not \u201csee any prospect for a negotiation anytime soon\u201d over the war, which has been ongoing since 2014 with Russia launching a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Speaking during a House of Lords debate, Lord Stirrup said it has been a \u201cdifficult\u201d year for Ukraine as weapons and personnel shortages are \u201champering\u201d its efforts to deal with the \u201cgrinding war of attrition\u201d pursued by Russia. According to the PA news agency, he told peers: But we should not assume that all the pressures are on the Ukrainian side. The appearance of North Korean soldiers in the conflict and the widening of the pool of prisoners, which Russia seeks to recruit soldiers from for the frontline underscores the difficulties that Putin is facing. The FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) assesses that these difficulties will reach crisis proportions by the end of 2025/beginning of 2026. The question then is how Ukraine is to stay in the fight until then. But for Ukraine to stay in the fight, Europe and ideally the United States must stay in the fight. In both regions, however, there are signs of growing war weariness and a desire to end the conflict whatever it takes. This would be a disastrous mistake.\u201d On the \u201clogical consequences\u201d of such a near-term settlement, Stirrup said he presumed an international agreement would be drawn up and signed by both sides. But the independent crossbench peer warned: We\u2019ve been there before and we\u2019ve seen only too clearly how little Putin regards or respects such agreements. The moment he feels they constrain his ambitions, he casts them aside without a second thought. Any piece of paper to which he puts his name would have about as much value as the one Neville Chamberlain waved in front of the cameras at Heston Aerodrome in 1938.\u201d Stirrup said neither side would be satisfied with an outcome that left the other in control of part of Ukraine, explaining: Putin would simply pursue his assault on his neighbour by undercover means while the Ukrainians would do the same in an effort to regain their lost territories until open fighting eventually broke out again.\u201d According to the PA news agency, he went on to express concerns over potential nuclear proliferation and Russia using food as a \u201cpolitical tool\u201d to spread its \u201cmalign influence more widely\u201d in Africa. Stirrup concluded: I don\u2019t aim to convince the minister or the government, I do not doubt their resolve. But European leaders need to do a much better job at explaining to their citizens the dire consequences that would attend a failure of nerve over Ukraine. Negotiating from a position of relative weakness would not bring an end to the conflict, it would carry huge nuclear risks, it would create fissures within western Europe, it will weaken deterrence and it\u2019d make a wider war more rather than less likely. It will leave our children and grandchildren a fearful legacy for which they would surely and rightly condemn us.\u201d The EU executive has said it has failed to reach agreement with the UK government in a dispute over fishing rights and has triggered an arbitration process under the post-Brexit deal. The European Commission announced on Friday that it was requesting an arbitration tribunal over the UK\u2019s decision to ban industrial fishing of sandeel in the North Sea. Rishi Sunak\u2019s government closed the sandeel fishery in March 2024 to protect puffin and kittiwake birds that depend on the small fish for food, as well as restricting harmful bottom trawling that damages fragile sealife on the seafloor. But the EU argues that decision breaches the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation agreement that gives European fishing boats catch rights in UK waters. After several months of inconclusive talks to resolve the dispute, the commission said it was moving to the next step in the dispute resolution process. A commission spokesperson said on Friday: Since no such mutually agreeable solution was found during the consultations, we are now simply proceeding with the next steps in line with the trade and cooperation agreement to find a solution.\u201d The EU remained \u201copen to finding a mutually agreeable solution\u201d, the spokesperson added. Under the TCA, either the EU or UK can request an arbitration panel, which will consist of three members: nominees from both sides and a mutually agreed chair. The panel should be established within 10 days of any request and is expected to give a binding ruling in around four to five months. When the previous government confirmed the closure of sandeel fishing at the start of this year, it quoted the head of the RSPB describing the decision as \u201ca vital lifeline from our government for our seabirds when they need it most\u201d. The commission claims that measures are already in place to protect sandeel in line with scientific advice. Downing Street will announce five new freeports in next week\u2019s budget as part of its effort to drive economic growth. Ministers will set out plans to establish five new low-tax zones, plus an investment zone in the East Midlands, where businesses will benefit from tax breaks such as lower tariffs and customs. Freeports operated without great impact in the UK between 1984 and 2012, when they were phased out by David Cameron. Rishi Sunak re-established them while he was chancellor to try to offset post-Brexit tariffs and create the conditions for long-term stable investment. Since 2021, eight have been opened in England and two each in Scotland and Wales. Keir Starmer said the freeports being announced next week would \u201chave this government\u2019s stamp on them\u201d despite being a policy inherited from the Tories. Read the full story here: More than 29,000 migrants have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel, including 500 in a single day, Home Office figures show. On Thursday, 509 people made the journey in 11 boats, taking the provisional total for 2024 to date to 29,154. This is 10% higher than the 26,501 recorded this time last year but 24% lower than the 38,129 people making the journey at this stage in 2022. On the subject of slavery reparations, Downing Street has said that its position on reparations also covers non-financial reparations. The prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson said: Our position on reparations is clear, and that goes for other forms of non-financial reparatory justice too. The prime minister\u2019s focus is on addressing the challenges that we face. They added the prime minister has \u201cbeen clear that the issues that have come up the most\u201d at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting are \u201cclimate change and also the opportunities presented in terms of trade and growth between this grouping of like-minded nations\u201d. We have a bit more from No 10 on the confusion over the Labour manifesto\u2019s definition of \u201cworking people\u201d who would be protected from tax rises. Asked whether people with stocks and shares are classed as \u201cworking people\u201d, the prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson said: The point that the prime minister was making in his interviews yesterday is that it is those who cannot always write a cheque who are the hardest hit by economic shocks - and that\u2019s why it\u2019s vital that we restore economic stability and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see set out in terms of the approach at the budget next week. The spokesperson later added: He was speaking about who is at the forefront of his mind\u2019s eye in terms of the priorities and the decisions that the government takes when it comes to economic stability. Rachel Reeves must \u201cget the balance right\u201d when announcing changes to Britain\u2019s debt rules in next week\u2019s budget given the potential knock-on effects to borrowing and mortgage rates, the boss of NatWest has warned. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Paul Thwaite, said markets would be sensitive to the chancellor\u2019s reasons for releasing up to \u00a350bn of borrowing headroom after she confirmed in Washington on Thursday that she planned to rewrite her fiscal rules. Thwaite said it was not a surprise that the new Labour government was looking to change the way public debt was measured in order to boost its spending power, noting that the UK had \u201cmany different fiscal frameworks in recent years\u201d. However, he added that the way in which financial markets react to those changes, and the subsequent knock-on effects to borrowing and mortgage rates, will depend on what the government plans to spend that money on. \u201cThe market will take into account, really, what\u2019s trying to be achieved by any change,\u201d Thwaite said after the bank reported its third-quarter results on Friday. \u201cSo [they will focus on] what does that mean for spending, what does it mean for investments, what does it mean for tax, rather than the specific rules per se.\u201d The warning comes two years after the disastrous mini-budget of the then prime minister, Liz Truss, in which announcements over unfunded tax cuts for the wealthy triggered a market meltdown and a surge in borrowing costs that hit homeowners across the country. Businesses that import critical minerals to the UK will be given access to state-backed loans in a move to counter China\u2019s dominance in the market. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is expected to announce extra government support to encourage the import of critical minerals such as lithium, graphite and cobalt in her budget next week. Companies that bring supplies of critical minerals into the UK will be able to access state-backed loans under the UK export finance mechanism. Critical minerals are key raw materials for technologies used in the supply of renewable energy and production of electric car batteries. They are also used in the defence and aerospace industries. The move is intended to make it easier for UK businesses to import critical minerals from Commonwealth countries such as Australia, which has huge deposits of lithium and other raw materials. Demand for critical minerals is expected to far exceed supply over the next decade. Countries are increasingly reliant on imports from China, which has bought up critical mineral reserves around the world. China controlled 72% of the world\u2019s supply of lithium and 68% of cobalt in 2022, according to figures from the Chatham House thinktank. The announcement was to be made on the margins of the Commonwealth summit in Samoa. Asked whether western countries should be countering China\u2019s influence in Commonwealth countries in the Indo-Pacific, a UK government spokesperson said it was \u201can incredibly important strategic area\u201d. They said: The Pacific is a crucial area for geopolitics, security and economic interests. By 2050 over half of global growth will come from the wider Indo-Pacific and 60% of global shipping trade already transits in this region.\u201d Downing Street is blocking moves to include a ban on smoking outdoors in the upcoming Tobacco and Vapes bill amid fierce opposition by the hospitality trade. No 10 officials privately believe that banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is \u201can unserious\u201d policy and is not backed by good evidence showing that it harms non-smokers. Differences of opinion in government about an outdoor ban, and uncertainty about the potential risks of pressing ahead with it, lie behind the delayed publication of its long-promised landmark bill. It will make the UK the world\u2019s first country to progressively raise the age at which people can buy tobacco until no one can do so legally. Keir Starmer has insisted that he is ready to face down critics of his drive to eradicate smoking because action is needed to reduce the 80,000 annual death toll from Britain\u2019s biggest killer. But No 10 was said to be \u201cspooked\u201d by strongly worded warnings that job losses and pub closures will result if smoking in some outdoor settings is outlawed, despite the prime minister\u2019s repeated insistence that \u201cnanny state\u201d jibes will not stop him taking robust action to improve public health. The Guardian understands that Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, is not keen on proceeding with it, despite Starmer\u2019s previous refusal to rule it out. \u201cIt is an unserious policy. Nobody really believes smoking outdoors is a major health problem,\u201d one Downing Street official said. The trade body UKHospitality said the ban threatens \u201cserious economic harm to hospitality venues\u201d and would hit nightclubs, hotels, cafes and restaurants as well as pubs. The British Beer and Pub Association said the plan was \u201cdeeply concerning and difficult to understand\u201d and \u201cyet another blow to the viability of our nation\u2019s vital community assets\u201d. Ending smokers\u2019 ability to go outside a pub to have a cigarette, for example in a beer garden, \u201cwould have a devastating impact on pubs already struggling\u201d with rising costs, it claimed. You can read the full piece by Pippa Crerar and Denis Campbell here: AstraZeneca has said it may cut jobs at its UK operation if the government enforces a global push to make companies share profits derived from nature\u2019s genetic codes, multiple sources have told the Guardian. The alleged comments from the company came amid a concerted lobbying push by the pharmaceutical industry against the profit-sharing measures. Sources told the Guardian that the British-Swedish biotech company \u2013 which made $5.96bn (\u00a34.59bn) profit last year \u2013 made the comments during a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs roundtable meeting last week to discuss a proposed new global levy on drugs derived from the digital forms of biodiversity. A spokesperson for AstraZeneca denied the comments were made by their representative. The genetic codes of nature \u2013 which, when stored digitally, are known as digital sequence information (DSI) \u2013 are playing a growing role in new drug development in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. But there is widespread anger among biodiverse countries about how DSI is being used by multinational companies to develop commercial products \u2013 almost always for free. Most of the world\u2019s remaining biodiversity is concentrated in poorer countries. They argue that the free use of this genetic information amounts to \u201cbiopiracy\u201d, and say companies should share profits when indigenous species are used to develop commercial products. Global leaders have already agreed in principle that these benefits should be shared more fairly. They are now gathered in Cali, Colombia, at the biodiversity Cop16, in negotiations over what form that sharing should take. Ideas under consideration include a 1% global tax on profits of goods derived from DSI, which could cost the Cambridge-based company as much as $60m if enforced by the UK government [that figure represents an estimated maximum, as not all of the firm\u2019s profit would be derived from DSI]. Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said the UK should \u201cunequivocally reject\u201d claims of reparations, reports the PA news agency. \u201cWhile the topic of overseas aid and reparations is being discussed, let me confront it head on,\u201d he said in a speech at the Henry Jackson Society. He added: We must unequivocally reject these claims, they are based on false and misleading narratives about our past, after all it was Britain that worked harder than nearly any other country to eradicate the slave trade.\u201d Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said the contest is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d over after a survey by ConservativeHome suggested he was trailing Kemi Badenoch by 31% to 55%, reports the PA news agency. Asked whether the contest was all over, Jenrick said: Absolutely not \u2013 this is neck and neck, that\u2019s a survey not a poll.\u201d He claimed that previous polls had shown the contest to be \u201cneck and neck\u201d, adding: There\u2019s everything to fight for, and I\u2019m certainly going off around the country as I have throughout the summer. And I think my message is resonating with members and with the public that we need to learn our lessons, we need to have strong and clear policies now, not the vague promise of one tomorrow, unite the party and take the fight to Labour as quickly as possible.\u201d Additionally, Jenrick said in a speech at the Henry Jackson Society in London that the UK \u201cmust\u201d spend 3% of GDP on defence. He added: Because we should not be borrowing or taxing more, this money should come from our overseas aid budget\u201d. \u201cOur generosity will soon look very foolish if our weakness contributes to a war,\u201d he added. He also said that \u201c3% of GDP should be the new Nato standard expected of all member states\u201d. The value of the UK\u2019s private healthcare market rose to a record \u00a312.4bn last year as long NHS waiting lists fuelled demand from individuals and the health service paid for nearly \u00a33.5bn of procedures to help ease the care backlog. As private medical insurance boomed, total revenues generated in the independent healthcare sector hit an all-time high in real terms pegged to 2003 prices, research revealed. The total value of work done in hospitals, clinics and by privately practising doctors, including cataract removals, knee surgery and MRI scans, was \u00a31bn higher than in 2022, according to the latest report by the health data provider LaingBuisson. More patients went private last year as the NHS waiting list peaked at 7.77 million in September, up sharply from 4.57 million at the end of 2019. Increasing numbers took out private medical insurance to fund their treatment, while there has been a decline in those paying out of their own pockets, LaingBuisson said. To help clear the backlog, the NHS paid more to private providers to offer treatments. It spent \u00a32.1bn in private hospitals last year \u2013 up from \u00a31.9bn in 2022 \u2013 accounting for nearly a third of their revenues, compared with 10% two decades ago. The NHS spent a further \u00a31.5bn at private clinics. Of 1.3m procedures carried out by private hospitals and clinics in 2023, nearly 445,000 were funded by the health service, the report found. Cataract surgery is the most common private procedure, costing about \u00a32,000 for private payers and less for NHS contracts. Chemotherapy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, colonoscopies, hip replacements, knee arthroscopies and replacements and hernia repair were the top private procedures. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, wants to use the private sector to cut the NHS care backlog. This week, he said delays within the health service spelled a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for some NHS patients, as Keir Starmer stressed the need for more use of AI and technology. A group that emerged out of a faction of the Conservative party has become a forum for Britain\u2019s splintered far right. A private conference hosted earlier this month by the Traditional Britain Group (TBG) was attended by figures from the Homeland party, an extreme nationalist group, as well as rivals from other groups such as Patriotic Alternative. Speakers at the conference, held behind closed doors in a luxury London hotel, included Gerold Otten, a member of Germany\u2019s Bundestag for the rising Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party, and Lynda Rose, an Anglican priest and the CEO of a Christian pressure group working with senior conservative figures in the Church of England. Another keynote speaker was David Clews, a former Tory councillor who runs a conspiracy theory website, which was a prolific spreader of misinformation against the backdrop of this summer\u2019s riots. The TBG, which was founded by a former officer of the Monday Club after the Conservative party severed links with the group, gained prominence after the then Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg addressed its annual dinner. He then \u201cdissociated\u201d himself from it and later described his attendance as a \u201cmistake\u201d. Among those attending the TBG\u2019s annual conference on Saturday at St Ermin\u2019s hotel in Westminster, which is owned by the Marriott Group, were at least three activists from the Homeland party, which is regarded as one of the most dangerous groups on the British far right. They included Kenny Smith, a former BNP activist who was previously admonished after pleading guilty to firearms charges, and Anthony Burrows, a parish councillor who lost a shotgun licence and had three shotguns seized by police because of concerns over his far-right links. Rose, the CEO of the socially conservative Voice for Justice UK Christian campaign group, told the Guardian she was not, and is not, aware of any links of delegates to the conference with far-right or extremist groups. She said: I have no knowledge of the affiliations of members within the Traditional Britain group.\u201d She said she had attended to inform delegates of the work of the Commission of Inquiry into Discrimination Against Christians (CIDAC). The continuing row over ministers\u2019 definition of working people came as the chancellor signalled she would rewrite the way government debt is measured in her first budget. During a round of broadcast interviews while attending the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington DC, Rachel Reeves said she faced difficult choices but insisted her budget would \u201cbegin to fix the NHS and start to rebuild our economy\u201d, reports the PA news agency. The cost of government borrowing increased in response to speculation the chancellor would change debt rules to spend billions more on investments. Tory former chancellor Jeremy Hunt said increased borrowing could increase the cost of mortgages for hundreds of thousands of households. Reeves confirmed a technical change in the way she would measure progress against the target of managing debt. Writing in the Financial Times, Reeves said her fiscal rules would be \u201cthe rock of stability at the core of my budget\u201d. Labour\u2019s 2024 election manifesto said Reeves would follow two rules: the current budget would be in balance so that day-to-day costs are met by revenues; the second rule is that debt must be falling as a share of the economy by the fifth year of the economic forecast. On Thursday she confirmed that the way debt is measured as part of that target would be changed to allow greater flexibility. According to the PA news agency, Reeves said: My fiscal rules will do two things. The first and most important: my stability rule will mean that day-to-day spending will be matched by revenues. Given the state of the public finances and the need to invest in our public services, this rule will bite hardest. Alongside tough decisions on spending and welfare, that means taxes will need to rise to ensure this rule is met. I will always protect working people when I make these choices, while taking a balanced approach. Crucially, my stability rule will also cover the interest on our national debt and unlike the previous government I won\u2019t cut capital budgets to make up for shortfalls in the day-to-day running costs of departments. My second fiscal rule, the investment rule, will get debt falling as a proportion of our economy. That will make space for increased investment in the fabric of our economy, and ensure we don\u2019t see the falls in public sector investment that were planned under the last government.\u201d Reeves is expected to target public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) as her new benchmark for government debt rather than the current measure of underlying public sector net debt, reports the PA news agency. Keir Starmer does not think all owners of stocks and shares fall outside his definition of \u201cworking people\u201d, Downing Street has signalled, amid confusion over who will be protected from tax rises in next week\u2019s budget. The prime minister had suggested asset owners would not fall within his conception of what a working person is. The government has been asked repeatedly to define this term, in a bid to establish which taxes may rise in the budget. Labour\u2019s manifesto said the party would not increase taxes on working people, including VAT, national insurance, and income tax. During a broadcast interview at a Commonwealth summit in Samoa, Starmer told Sky News that he does not consider people who have an income from assets such as shares of property to be working people. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come within my definition,\u201d he said. The hint at who falls outside the scope of Starmer\u2019s definition could point to where tax rises might come from in the budget. Among the levies which are reportedly under consideration for a hike are capital gains tax, inheritance tax, and fuel duty, reports the PA news agency. In a partial climbdown on Starmer\u2019s position, Downing Street later clarified that people who hold a small amount of savings in stocks and shares still count as working people. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said Starmer meant someone who primarily gets their income from assets in his interview. On Friday morning, a Treasury minister said it was \u201cimportant to focus on\u201d where people are getting their money from in relation to the debate over the \u201cworking people\u201d definition. James Murray told Sky News that \u201ca working person is someone who goes out to work and who gets their income from work\u201d. Pushed further on whether a working person could also get income from shares or property, Murray added: We\u2019re talking about where people get their money from, and so working people get their money from going out to work. And it\u2019s that money that we\u2019re talking about in terms of those commitments we made around income tax, around national insurance. That\u2019s what\u2019s important to focus on, where people are getting their money from, getting their money from going out to work.\u201d Eleni Courea reporting from Apia: Keir Starmer has said he understands the \u201cstrength of feeling\u201d in the Commonwealth about reparatory justice but that countries should work together to ensure their future is \u201cnot in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it\u201d. Speaking in an executive session of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) hosted in Samoa, the prime minister conceded that the Commonwealth had to \u201cacknowledge our shared history \u2013 especially when it\u2019s hard\u201d. Downing Street has firmly ruled out paying reparations to its former colonies and said it\u2019s not on the agenda for the summit, but Caribbean countries have been pushing for them to be mentioned in the communique. \u201cI understand the strength of feeling here and that there are some calls to face up to the harms and injustices of the past through reparatory justice,\u201d Starmer told leaders. \u201cThe UK believes the most effective way to maintain a spirit of respect and dignity is by working together to make sure the future is not in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it.\u201d The Guardian reported this week that the UK was open to discussing non-cash forms of reparatory justice such as reforming financial institutions Starmer had been due to hold a bilateral meeting on Friday with the president of Ghana Nana Akufo-Addo, who has spoken in favour of reparations in the past, but it was called off because of timing constraints. Keir Starmer has confronted calls for the UK to pay reparations for its historical part in the slave trade while surrounded by Commonwealth leaders. Speaking at an executive session of a Commonwealth summit in Samoa, the prime minister said it was important to acknowledge a \u201chard\u201d shared history, and that he understood the \u201cstrength of feeling\u201d about reparations, reports the PA news agency. Flanked by leaders from Uganda and Tanzania, Starmer said he wanted to work \u201ctogether to make sure the future is not in the shadow of the past\u201d, and promised to host a UK-Caribbean forum with leaders of the nations most affected by slavery\u2019s legacy. The prime minister has insisted reparations are not on the table for the Commonwealth summit, even as leaders from Caribbean and African member states have called for discussions on the issue. The UK has conceded that the issue of reparations could be included in a document due to be signed off at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting this week. The PA news agency reports that sources accept that there could be a reference to reparatory justice in the communique, but officials stressed that this would not necessarily mean any change in the UK\u2019s policy position. More on that in a moment, but first, here is an update of the latest developments in UK politics: Keir Starmer does not think all owners of stocks and shares fall outside his definition of \u201cworking people\u201d, Downing Street has signalled. The prime minister had suggested asset owners would not fall within his conception of what a working person is. The government has been asked repeatedly to define this term, in a bid to establish which taxes may rise in the budget. Downing Street is blocking moves to include a ban on smoking outdoors in the upcoming Tobacco and Vapes bill amid fierce opposition by the hospitality trade. No 10 officials privately believe that banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is \u201can unserious\u201d policy and is not backed by good evidence showing that it harms non-smokers. A Treasury minister has said he does not accept the idea that changes to the fiscal rules could \u201cpunish families with mortgages\u201d, as was suggested by former chancellor Jeremy Hunt. When asked on Times Radio whether he accepted that, James Murray, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury said \u201cwell, no.\u201d Rachel Reeves will pledge to reverse huge cuts in public investment in her budget next week after she confirmed that rules limiting her spending power will be overhauled to enable the government to release as much as \u00a350bn for infrastructure spending. Businesses that import critical minerals to the UK will be given access to state-backed loans in a move to counter China\u2019s dominance in the market. The chancellor is expected to announce extra government support to encourage the import of critical minerals such as lithium, graphite and cobalt in her budget next week. The value of the UK\u2019s private healthcare market rose to a record \u00a312.4bn last year as long NHS waiting lists fuelled demand from individuals and the health service paid for nearly \u00a33.5bn of procedures to help ease the care backlog. A group that emerged out of a faction of the Conservative party has become a forum for Britain\u2019s splintered far right. A private conference hosted earlier this month by the Traditional Britain Group (TBG) was attended by figures from the Homeland party, an extreme nationalist group, as well as rivals from other groups such as Patriotic Alternative.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>NO WAY, JOS\u00c9</strong></h2> <p>For a man who famously \u201ccannot speak\u201d, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho invariably has plenty to say. During his pre-match press conference the day before Fenerbahce\u2019s Bigger Vase game against Manchester United, he cut a relaxed figure who seemed to be enjoying his reunion with his former muckers from the English press pack. And why wouldn\u2019t he? Especially when so many of them can be replied upon to greet his staggeringly unfunny gags with the kind of sycophantic, excessively loud and undeserved laughter you only ever hear at such events.</p> <p>A handful of them went on to chronicle the encounter in the kind of glowing terms that could only have been more fawning if they\u2019d been written or broadcast by Bambi. And while Mourinho may no longer be among the world\u2019s elite managers, he remains second to very few when it comes to charming curiously obsequious broadcasters, hacks and football fans, the kind who continue to describe him in glowing terms as \u201ca character,\u201d but seem to have forgotten that he can be an extremely unpleasant one.</p> <p>Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/24/fenerbahce-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report\">last night\u2019s 1-1 draw in Istanbul</a>, Mourinho made sure to talk up the visiting side as if it were Lord Ferg\u2019s Treble winners who were coming to town, rather than the worst United team ever seen by anyone who has been watching football for the past 30 years. It was a tactic straight from the tried and trusted Mourinho playbook and meant whatever the outcome of the match, he would be able to spin it as some sort of victory for his team. And so it came to pass when, upon being asked if in a post-match interview if he was happy his team had got a point against a club that sacked him for being only marginally less rubbish than the bloke currently in charge, he insisted \u201cthey got a point against us, not us against them\u201d.</p> <p>Having taken an age to leave the touchline after being sent to the stands by the referee, Cl\u00e9ment Turpin, for protesting an entirely correct decision not to award Fenerbahce a penalty for what he perceived to be a foul by Manuel Ugarte on Bright Osayi-Samuel, Mourinho <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/24/fenerbahces-jose-mourinho-scathing-towards-referee-after-receiving-red-card\">offered his thoughts</a> on the French referee\u2019s decision to show him a red card. \u201cHe told me something incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cHe told me at the same time he could see the action in the box and my behaviour on the touchline. I congratulate him because it is absolutely incredible, his peripheral vision. During the game, 100 miles per hour, he had one eye on the penalty situation and one eye on the bench and my behaviour. That\u2019s the explanation he gave me, and that\u2019s why he is one of the best referees in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Having sarcastically trashed the French match official \u2013 just the latest referee to have incurred Mourinho\u2019s entirely unjustified hectoring \u2013 the Portuguese was asked if he\u2019d had a chance to review the correct decision he\u2019d railed against. Tellingly, he stopped short of accusing Turpin of highway robbery, presumably because he knew he didn\u2019t have a leg to stand and deliver on. \u201cI watched the incident, I do not speak about the incident,\u201d he said, having already made his feelings on it and other matters tediously clear.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Xaymaca Awoyungbo for live women\u2019s friendly updates from England 2-2 Germany (7.30pm BST) at Wembley, while Scott Murray will cover Leicester 0-0 Nottingham Forest (8pm BST) in the Premier League.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be back working in football after a period out of the game.

      "bodyText": "A woman has alleged that Doug Emhoff slapped her during an argument when they were a couple in 2012, before he married Kamala Harris, and the accusation has prompted a spokesperson for the second gentleman to issue a denial. The woman has not publicly identified herself. She first spoke to the Daily Mail anonymously and then again after Emhoff\u2019s denial, on the condition that her name was not disclosed. The tabloid described her as a successful lawyer in New York and published pictures of the then couple, but with her face blurred out. She alleges that Emhoff struck her so hard while they were attending the Cannes film festival in France in 2012 that the force of the slap spun her around. The allegations were described as \u201cuntrue\u201d by a spokesperson for Emhoff, speaking to Semafor, as reported by CNN, who added that \u201cany suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false\u201d. The Daily Mail has cited three unnamed friends of the woman backing up her account and she has now accused Emhoff of hypocrisy. The woman had not given interviews herself until this week, when she spoke with the Daily Mail. The woman also criticized what she saw as Emhoff\u2019s burnishing of his reputation as a \u201cperfect\u201d spouse and a feminist, standing alongside Harris, the Democratic party nominee for president who will be the first female president of the US if she wins against Donald Trump next month. \u201cHe\u2019s being held out to be the antithesis of who he actually is. And that is utterly shocking,\u201d she told the Mail. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s election campaign has been pointing to the allegations against Emhoff as it fights back against damage to the Republican nominee\u2019s reputation from a civil verdict against him that he sexually abused writer E Jean Carroll and serial allegations from dozens of women that he has sexually assaulted them, all of which he has denied. .",

We\u2019ve had some tough bumps but we\u2019re all stood here ready to fight again and ready to go to Brighton to give everything to improve our situation in the league.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671b96348f080a42be756591\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T13:00:43.249Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Right, that\u2019s the end of my stint</strong> and I\u2019ll now put you in the very capable hands of <strong>Barry Glendenning</strong> who will see you through to your Friday night tea.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671b94648f085a58218123c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T12:58:08.356Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkySportsPL/status/1849788238447173873\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"He's doing fantastic with us\" \ud83d\udc4f<br><br>Enzo Maresca says Nicolas Jackson is key to Chelsea's plans \ud83d\udcaa <a href=\"https://t.co/4nuOfuY1ND\">pic.twitter.com/4nuOfuY1ND</a></p>\u2014 Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkySportsPL/status/1849788238447173873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 25, 2024</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671b93f28f085a58218123b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T12:51:33.613Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Think today\u2019s press conference action is over and done with?</strong> Think again.</p> \n  <p>Julen Lopetegui, Enzo Maresca and VAR\u2019s biggest advocate Gary O\u2019Neil have all been up on the mic.

A lot of people made up that it was \u2018do or die\u2019 against Leicester City and that I would be sacked if we lost.

West Ham: There is plenty of blame to go around in east London as the club\u2019s summer signings struggle in a team that lacks identity, writes Jacob Steinberg. This weekend\u2019s fixtures: At a complete loss for things to look out for in this weekend\u2019s round of Premier League games? Here are 10 from our writers to get you started \u2026 Tottenham Hotspur: Mikey Moore was so impressive in Tottenham\u2019s Europa League win over AZ Alkmaar last night his performance prompted comparisons with Neymar from his teammate James Maddison. \u201cFrom minutes 45 to 65 I thought we had Neymar on the left wing, he was brilliant, demanding the ball and fearless with that young fearless mentality and you never want to take that away from him,\u201d Maddison told TNT Sports when asked about the 17-year-old winger. When word of Maddison\u2019s tongue-in-cheek remarks reached him after the game, Ange Postecoglou could not help but see the funny side. \u201cIt was exciting,\u201d the Spurs boss said. \u201cI was going to try and downplay it but I\u2019ve heard Madders has called him Neymar! \u201cThe beauty of Mikey is I know it won\u2019t affect him at all. He\u2019s such a mature young man and he was so exciting. I was willing the boys to pass the ball to him.\u201d England women: Sarina Wiegman\u2019s Lionesses meet Germany in a friendly at Wembley tonight, in the first meeting between the sides won the Euros at the same venue in 2022. \u201cWe will always cherish that,\u201d said the England manager in the build-up to tonight\u2019s game. \u201cIt was one of the biggest moments of my career and of my life. But it\u2019s a totally different Germany team and we are different because we\u2019ve moved on too. It\u2019s the start of [going into] the next Euros. \u201cWe always want to progress faster but I think the game has increased, the level of the leagues in international football has increased and developed. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want, so that means we have to develop too. There\u2019s competition in the team, with other players coming in, and more experienced players have to help the younger players so we are all on the same page. We just know where we want to get to in July.\u201d England will face South Africa in another friendly in Coventry on Tuesday night as they continue their preparations for the defence of their European title in Switzerland next summer. Liverpool: Speaking about the importance \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 of not losing Sunday\u2019s match against Arsenal, Liverpool boss Arne Slot had this to say for himself. \u201cWe all know that taking points from your competitor [is important] and nobody knows in this early stage who is going to be your biggest competitor but I think we all know Arsenal will be one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cDropping points against them or winning points against them, that is always important.\u201d Brighton: Fabian Hurzeler has warned his players they cannot afford to underestimate Wolves as they attempt to build on their impressive start to the Premier League campaign. The Seagulls were somewhat lucky to beat Newcastle at St James\u2019 Park last weekend and welcome the league\u2019s bottom side to the Amex Stadium tomorrow. \u201cOne thing won\u2019t happen: we won\u2019t underestimate Wolverhampton because when you see their games, first of all, they\u2019ve had a really tough schedule, so they\u2019ve had tough games since the beginning of the season,\u201d said the German. \u201cAnd second of all, the truth is that they\u2019ve played well. In every game, they\u2019ve had the chance to win or to get a draw, and that\u2019s why we won\u2019t underestimate them. It will be a hard challenge. What I\u2019ve learned, especially from the first games, you can\u2019t underestimate any opponent.\u201d In-form Brighton striker Danny Welbeck was stretchered off the pitch with an injury to his lower back after scoring the only goal of the game at Newcastle but has returned to training but remains a doubt for tomorrow\u2019s game due to ongoing soreness. Crystal Palace: Along with Wolves, Southampton and Ipswich, Crystal Palace are one of four top flight seeking their first win of the season and they host Tottenham Hotspur tomorrow at Selhurst Park. He said the club are biding their time to see if Adam Wharton needs surgery on a nagging groin injury but insisted the midfielder will be part of the squad for the next three games. \u201cWe have all had better moments in football,\u201d he said of Palace\u2019s unexpectedly underwhelming start to the season. \u201cOf course, there was big disappointment after losing at Nottingham Forest. We met on Tuesday afternoon to analyse the game, but now we are looking forward to the Tottenham game. \u201cIt is about getting the heads and the chins up. We have had good training sessions and the mood has got better and better, but we are all humans so it takes time to deal with disappointment. We gave this time to the players. It has now been forgotten and the complete focus is on the Tottenham game.\u201d Aston Villa: Yesterday marked the second anniversary of Unai Emery\u2019s appointment as Aston Villa manager following the departure of Steven Gerrard. The club were 17th in the table at the time, just outside the relegation zone on goals scored. Today, Villa are sitting pretty at the top of the 36-team Champions League table after three games and comfortably ensconced in fourth place in the Premier League table. The Spanish manager has been refelcting on his first two years in charge of the club. \u201cHopefully we will improve more and more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been two years since I arrived here. We have been very demanding and we were always trying to be better in each moment we were working here. We achieved some objectives quickly, but there\u2019s still a lot of work to do. When we are achieving the objectives we can face each season, it\u2019s very important to work very hard. \u201cThis is the target with the players, club coaches. I am demanding with everybody, and of course we have to enjoy the way we are doing things. My demand is to play in Europe. The second dream I had in that moment and now is to get a trophy. We are looking forward to watching how we improve. I can feel comfort, I can feel confidence and I can feel the protection we have in our back four.\u201d Villa host Bournemouth tomorrow afternoon at Villa Park and will leapfrog Arsenal into third place, for a day at least, if they win or draw against Andoni Iraola\u2019s side. Arsenal: Wants some more thoughts direct from the mind of Mikel Arteta on his team\u2019s key absentees in the run-up to Arsenal\u2019s match against Liverpool on Sunday afternoon? Here you go \u2026 \u201cWe have had very difficult and challenging moments but I don\u2019t think this is one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so energised, the atmosphere will be tremendous and we are really looking forward to the game. \u201cI never think about losing. I don\u2019t spend one second on the preparation thinking about if we lose it. It is just very bad luck [with the injuries]. \u201cThey are difficult issues and traumatic injuries. International ones are difficult to control. It can happen but it is about how we can react to it and change it. The team have to mentally adapt to that and maintain the belief that even with the team like this, we are still a great team.\u201d Brentford: Mathias Jensen has been out since the end of August with a calf injury but Thomas Frank has revealed that the Danish midfielder is fit to retun for tomorrow\u2019s game against Ipswich Town. Kylian Mbappe: Paris St Germain will take their wage dispute with Kylian Mbappe to court after the French football league\u2019s governing body (LFP) ruled in favour of the France captain on Friday,\u201d according to Reuters. \u201cFrench media reported the 25-year-old, who has not commented on the dispute, is seeking around \u20ac55m (\u00a345.84m) in salary and bonuses he says he is owed by the club. The Ligue 1 champions, however, say Mbappe\u2019s contract was \u201clegally amended\u201d and that he reneged on commitments when he left the club to join Real Madrid in the close season. PSG said last month that Mbappe had refused an offer from the LFP to mediate on the issue. The LFP\u2019s National Joint Appeals Commission heard the parties on 15 October and announced today it had ruled in favour of Mbappe. \u201cThe club must pay him the salary he is claiming,\u201d they said. \u201cThis decision is not subject to appeal, but may be referred to the FFF Executive Committee\u201d. PSG said they would be \u201cforced to bring the case before the competent courts\u201d while still trying to find an \u201camicable solution\u201d with Mbappe, who became the French club\u2019s all-time top scorer during his seven-year stay in the capital. Brentford: Thomas Frank is in the next managerial cab off the rank and fields yet another question about his future. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s doing a bad job in his role as chief Beekeeper, but more a case that many journalists think he should be in charge of a bigger club. \u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019m very, very happy here,\u201d he declares. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic club with fantastic players, staff and owners but who knows what will happen in the future? It\u2019s impossible to say that I will stay here forever because life changes, things change - maybe they will kick me out. I have no control over that. \u201cOn the flip side, I may wake up one morning and think I need a new challenge or I move back to Denmark because I know eventually I will move back to Denmark. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about a bigger club - is a bigger club a bigger challenge? It\u2019s a different challenge. But it\u2019s irrelevant, I have a game tomorrow against Ipswich in which we need to do our very best to try to win.\u201d Indeed they do, because this reporter is down to the final two players in a game of Last Man Standing that started with 54 entrants and needs a Brentford victory tomorrow to win, or at the very least stay going in the competition. Please don\u2019t let me down, Frank! Arsenal: Mikel Arteta seems in chipper enough form two days before his side\u2019s big match against league leaders Liverpool, despite the fact he will be without key players such as Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and William Saliba. Needless to say, the subject of his absentees was riased in his pre-match presser \u2026 \u201cThis is the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t want to be in this situation but we are lucky to have the squad we have and the attitude to react to difficult situations. We don\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves, we face it and we know how good we are. \u201cWe have different options [in defence]. That partnership [between William Saliba and Gabriel] has been very stable but we have to find a solution. There is so much going on with the back line but we have had to adapt to that and the versatile players have been really useful. \u201cWe had a day off after the Champions League and two days to prepare for the game. This is a big match, a big opportunity, and we love these kind of matches at the Emirates. The team is really looking forward to it. \u201cWe have to maintain playing with dominance and belief. Our belief, energy and commitment is needed in a big match like this.\u201d Wolverhampton Wanderers: Gary O\u2019Neil has been chatting to the press and inevitably, the subject of VAR has come up. Bottom of the table and still waiting for their first win of the season, Wolves travel to Brighton this weekend on the back of a narrow defeat against Manchester City, who needed a late, late winner that wasn\u2019t entirely uncontroversial to take all three points at Molineux. The general consensus seems to be that John Stones\u2019 winner was probably fair enough but after being disallowed by the referee, it required an intervention from his video assistant before it stood. \u201cIt does feel like there\u2019s a lot of them go against us, either rightly or whatever we say,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are a few things that feel like they go against you when you\u2019re down at the bottom of the league. Statistically it\u2019s the toughest start a team has had since 2014 fixture-wise, [with] a couple of little VAR calls that we argue could have gone our way. \u201cBut regardless of all of that, the team, myself, the club and the fan base just stand up and fight every game, as you saw against Manchester City. We\u2019ve had some tough bumps but we\u2019re all stood here ready to fight again and ready to go to Brighton to give everything to improve our situation in the league.\u201d Right, that\u2019s the end of my stint and I\u2019ll now put you in the very capable hands of Barry Glendenning who will see you through to your Friday night tea. Think today\u2019s press conference action is over and done with? Think again. Julen Lopetegui, Enzo Maresca and VAR\u2019s biggest advocate Gary O\u2019Neil have all been up on the mic. Oh, and Pep Guardiola. More from Ten Hag is this is really quite mad, considering how utterly listless United were when they had 11 men in that Tottenham game. (They were actually better with 10). Feels like there\u2019s a bit of trouble brewing at Newcastle. Eddie Howe has addressed his latest problem in today\u2019s press conference: Erik ten Hag believes a collaborative effort is needed from Manchester United\u2019s players and staff to end the club\u2019s problems with injuries. Last season United had a total of 66 injuries and more have followed this term with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, Kobbie Mainoo and Leny Yoro currently sidelines. \u201cThat holds us back in our levels,\u201d Ten Hag said. \u201cAlso in our position in the league [12th]. Because when you don\u2019t have the players available, you can\u2019t line up the best team. And that is what\u2019s holding us back at this moment. We need more players, often available. And then we have to work all together on this point. And that is the players, the coaching staff, all the other staff. We have to do better to get more available players. \u201cBecause we know when we have them, we are a really tough team to play. And when we have them, we can be really successful. And that is what we have shown over the last couple of months.\u201d Look away Arsenal fans (and FPL managers): Fulham manager Marco Silva will put sentiment to one side as he returns to Goodison Park for what could be the last time this weekend. The Portuguese spent a little more than 18 months in charge of Everton from 2018-19 \u2013 taking them to eighth in the Premier League, a finish they have not matched since \u2013 and still retains an affection for a stadium the club are soon to leave. The Toffees are due to move into their new arena at Bramley Moore Dock at the start of next season after 133 years at Goodison. Yet that is not Silva\u2019s concern on Saturday as he bids to get Fulham back to winning ways after successive defeats to Manchester City and Aston Villa either side of the international break. Silva said in a press conference: \u201cIt was an honour to manage a club like Everton. I\u2019m not the first or last, for sure, to say that because when you are there, you can feel how it\u2019s a big club, how they have a massive fan base. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic (stadium), an old school one as well and there\u2019s something special around the place. You can feel it. As a home manager, you can feel it more because it\u2019s week-in, week-out. Even when you go there playing away you can feel it as well. It\u2019s a special place to play. \u201cNow I am a manager in different colours. We know it\u2019s going to be a tough game but we have to explore what we want to explore and be aware of where they are strong. We are capable of getting the three points and, of course, that\u2019s what we want.\u201d PA Have Swindon Town appointed Holloway simply on the basis that he\u2019s from the west country and therefore knows his way around the nearby roads and the local Tesco? Who can say. Will Swindon Town be box office news during the 61-year-old managerial spell? Almost certainly. Thanks John. I\u2019ll start with this: Ian Holloway is back in business at Swindon Town \u2013 who saw that coming? \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be back working in football after a period out of the game as I wanted to get back into it if the right opportunity arose which, with this opportunity, I feel is the perfect fit for me,\u201d said Holloway, who has signed a deal until the end of the season. \u201cConversations happened very quickly and both sides were very keen to get the deal done and of course, I was delighted to engage with a club like Swindon Town, a club of whom I know a lot about due to my location and knowledge of the local area.\u201d And with that, I shall hand over to Dom Booth, somewhere in the vicinity of the A6. Here\u2019s the kiss of death for Russell Martin, being patronised by Pep Guardiola as Manchester City play Southampton on Saturday. Pep: \u201cHe will have success sooner or later. Normally when you change your thoughts and ideas then the players will notice and know you\u2019re not a believer. \u201cIt is one of our jobs to convince the players we are in a good way. It is impossible to train them in something if you show you\u2019re not believing. \u201cI always have a lot of respect for Championship promoted teams. I don\u2019t know how we can complain sometimes [about the fixture schedule] because look at how many games the Championship teams play.\u201d \u201cThey have the courage to play and are brave with the ball. Wolves were at the bottom and we struggled to win.\u201d Here\u2019s Erik ten Hag after that draw in Istanbul. K\u00e1ri Tulinius gets in touch: \u201cWhile I\u2019ll admit that I find Mourinho\u2019s antics, at times, entertaining, I abhor the side of him that feels it okay to bully other, less powerful people. He abuses his status to ruin people\u2019s days, and in some cases careers. I hated it when he did it to Anders Frisk, Eva Carneiro and many others, and I hope UEFA comes down on him like a ton of bricks for his criticism of Clement Turpin.\u201d No Son for Spurs against Crystal Palace: Ange: \u201cSonny\u2019s still not right, still not feeling 100%. He won\u2019t train today, so he\u2019s unlikely for this weekend and we\u2019ll see after that.\u201d Jacob Steinberg has the lowdown on West Ham\u2019s troubled season. So much has to change and the question is whether Lopetegui can inspire. There is alarm at board level. There is a sense that a buck-passing operation is under way. Steidten was involved in bringing Lopetegui to David Sullivan, West Ham\u2019s biggest shareholder, but it is interesting that reports in Germany have suggested the former Dortmund manager Edin Terzic is being lined up if results do not improve. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho hasn\u2019t lost it. Not in press conferences, anyway. Here\u2019s a good stat. Perhaps the Chelsea PA system should play Young Hearts, Run Free when they play Newcastle on Sunday. Your MLS playoff guide here from our writers. Remember, Messi and Becks will already be at the Fifa Club World Cup jamboree. Slot on Arsenal: \u201cWe all know that taking points from your competitor and nobody knows in this early stage who is going to be your biggest competitor but I think we all know Arsenal will be one of them. Dropping points against them or winning points against them, that is always important.\u201d Slot: \u201cFederico [Chiesa] might train with us today or tomorrow, but Jota definitely not and Conor Bradley, let\u2019s see if he can be with us tomorrow.\u201d Liverpool play at Arsenal on Sunday and Slot will be hoping for more of the same from recent matches, each seen out as a victory. I think every game has its own story. Leizpig was a different period of rest, that is why maybe Leizpig were better at the end than us. Palace game - 1 or 2 transition moments for them and setpieces. Last game, Chelsea\u2019s chance was a setpiece late on. I liked the last 6 mins of injury time in Leipzig when we constantly had the ball and those moments were not difficult. I am not worried but I prefer to see us dominate until the end but if we have to defend, we have a team who defend with 11. Arne Slot has been talking about his Liverpool team\u2019s great defensive record. Two reasons we don\u2019t concede a lot. Most games, we dominated and controlled for large parts, so that helps if you have the ball but I also like if we have difficult parts of the game then the work rate is incredible not to concede. If you combine that with Virgil and Ibou [Konat\u00e9] and the two goalkeepers we\u2019ve used, these elements are why we haven\u2019t conceded so much. Quansah and Gomez too we are in a good place with centre-backs. Never change, Jos\u00e9. And he won\u2019t, you know. Suits reshuffle at Arsenal. Darren Fletcher has been charged with misconduct: that\u2019s the Manchester United coach, not the TV commentator. The FA charges relate to last week\u2019s Brentford game. Ian Graham was one of the laptop gurus behind Liverpool\u2019s success in the Klopp era, as director of research. Here he details one of the signings that laid that success, and signed before Klopp was Liverpool manager. Some strong words from Russell Martin, who takes his Southampton side to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Many feared the end was nigh for Martin after the loss to Leicester, but he has come out fighting. \u201cPerception and reality are often very far apart in football. A lot of people made up that it was \u2018do or die\u2019 against Leicester City and that I would be sacked if we lost. To the point where I got asked about my job after the game, because in this industry you\u2019re just allowed to ask about people\u2019s jobs all the time,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI\u2019m here. I have a really good relationship with the owners. We\u2019re trying to build and grow something, build on what we\u2019ve done over the last 15 or 16 months. And I\u2019ll continue to do that to the best of my ability, with the same love and care that I have in the time that I\u2019ve been here, the same will to improve and the same work ethic. \u201cSo until I\u2019m told otherwise, I will do that. We\u2019ve got a really good, honest and open relationship. I want more points, they want more points. Should we have had more points? Yes. I think if the performances and data suggested much differently, if it wasn\u2019t what it was, then maybe it\u2019s different conversations. But I feel nothing but support from them right now and it won\u2019t impact my job either way.\u201d Here\u2019s what to look out for in the top flight this weekend \u2026 John Brewin will be here shortly to take up the reins. I\u2019ve got to pop off for a bit. Sean Dyche, Marco Silva and Andoni Iraola are among the Premier League managers who have been addressing the press this morning. He\u2019ll run through what they\u2019ve said (if they\u2019ve said anything interesting) and I\u2019ll be back on a bit later. Grab yourself a coffee. Elsewhere in Europe\u2019s secondary competition: Ipswich looking to emulate Brentford? They could do a lot worse. And Kieran McKenna believes Brentford are a model for promoted clubs to copy in the Premier League, while insisting Ipswich have had a different route to the top light. Under manager Thomas Frank, the Bees secured promotion to the Premier League for the first time in 2021 and finished ninth in the table the following year. Now in their fourth season, Brentford sit 13th in the league and come up against newly-promoted Ipswich on Saturday afternoon. The Tractor Boys enjoyed back-to-back promotions to reach the top-flight for the first time in 22 years and while McKenna stressed that Ipswich are on their own path, he believes Brentford can be seen as a good example for newly-promoted clubs to learn from. They\u2019ve got their own model, I think everyone\u2019s model is different, but there\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019ve done a fantastic job as a club and Thomas has done a fantastic job as a manager and the coaching staff with him. I think different clubs have their own context, of course there\u2019s things that Brentford have done well that we can take some inspiration from. On the other hand, their journey is different than ours, the season before they got promoted, they lost in the play-off final. They had a couple of years pushing at the very top of the Championship. By the time they arrived in the Premier League, to be honest, they\u2019re probably pretty much had their Premier League team already set. They\u2019ve had their own journey, our journey is very different to that with the speed of the ascent that we\u2019ve made, but there\u2019s no doubt they\u2019ve done some things very well and any newly-promoted club can look at some of the things they\u2019ve done and see it as an example. Last night was a recall to vintage Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, wasn\u2019t it? There was something knowing in his box office rage against the referee, Clement Turpin, as well as his post and pre-match press conferences, in the full knowledge that millions of eyes would be on him and Fenerbahce given it was Manchester United and this iteration of Manchester United, manager under fire and all that. Mou even made a plea to return to the Premier League one day. The contrast to Erik ten Hag\u2019s far more placid and rather forgettable interviews couldn\u2019t have been starker. \u201cI think the best thing I have to do when I leave Fenerbahce I go to a club that doesn\u2019t play in Uefa competitions,\u201d said Mourinho with a wink. \u201cSo if any club in England at the bottom of the table needs a manager in the next two years, I\u2019m ready to go. I don\u2019t want to say anything else \u2013 we played absolutely fantastic against a team that is far more superior.\u201d Never change, Jos\u00e9. Lazio winger Loum Tchaouna was substituted after being racially abused by fans during their 2-0 win at Dutch club Twente in the Europa League, the Italian club\u2019s coach Marco Baroni said. Frenchman Tchaouna, pictured below, was clearly incensed before being taken off in the 89th minute and imitated someone making monkey noises when explaining to the bench what had upset him. Baroni said he was preparing to substitute Pedro but decided to take off Tchaouna after being unable to calm the 21-year-old. \u201cThe howling at Tchaouna? Unfortunately I confirm that the player perceived this,\u201d Baroni told Sky Sport Italia. \u201cIt\u2019s a subject I don\u2019t want to expand on now, we tried to calm him down and then I substituted him because he was no longer in the emotional condition to continue. But I think the fourth official saw what happened.\u201d Uefa did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters about the abuse of Tchaouna sent outside normal business hours. Lazio are one of a string of clubs sanctioned by UEFA for the racist behaviour of their supporters in European competition this season. The Serie A club were fined \u20ac45,000 (around \u00a337,500) and will be forced to close two sections of their stadium for their next Europa League home game. Also in the world of football this weekend, in a lovely twist of narrative, England\u2019s women play Germany at Wembley tonight. The friendly clash is the first meeting between the sides since the Euro 2022 final and comes JUST DAYS after England\u2019s men\u2019s side appointed a German, Thomas Tuchel, as manager. Of course, the Lionesses have had an overseas manager for some time and she\u2019s done rather well. Leah Williamson has been speaking some sense, as usual, about the situation. Williamson said: \u201cYou can\u2019t pick and choose when it suits us [to have a foreign coach], just based on the result. We\u2019ve had great times with Sarina, I think she\u2019s an honorary Brit now anyway. I know that we\u2019ve all been very happy with Sarina.\u201d Good morning and happy (nearly) weekend, football fans. Mercifully, it\u2019s one of those more enjoyable autumn weeks that doesn\u2019t call itself an international break and so it\u2019s been jam-packed with juicy action. From the idiosyncratic touchline antics of peak Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in Istanbul last night, to a historic European win for Welsh minnows TNS, to all the fallout from the Champions League, which will quickly turn into domestic league buildup as the press conferences rev into gear today. And it is a doozy of a weekend in the Premier League, to be fair. Arsenal host table-topping Liverpool \u2013 (will Bukayo Saka be fit? Probably not) \u2013 Erik ten Hag faces a somewhat tricky away trip to West Ham and the team Manchester City will put five past at the Etihad on Saturday is \u2026 checks notes \u2026 Southampton. Myself and John Brewin will be here until the afternoon, at which time the right honourable Barry Glendenning will take over to see you through. Let\u2019s start off with some classic Friday preview reading.",

      "body": "<p>A British man, 20, has pleaded guilty to an offence under the new National Security Act and an arson attack on a Ukraine-linked business.</p> <p>Dylan Earl, from Elmesthorpe in Leicestershire, admitted the charge in relation to a fire in March at an east London warehouse belonging to a man only referred to in court as Mr X, the Old Bailey heard.</p> <p>Earl is believed to be the first person to be convicted of an offence under the National Security Act 2023 after pleading guilty to preparatory conduct to commit acts involving serious violence and endangering life in the UK.</p> <p>He was the first person to be charged under Section 18 of the act, which was introduced in response to the threat of hostile activity from states targeting the UK. Earl was accused in previous court hearings of carrying out the act on behalf of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, which the UK has proscribed as a terrorist organisation.</p> <p>Wearing a blue shirt and dark tie, Earl spoke to confirm his name and enter pleas to three charges. He denied one count of assisting a foreign intelligence service, which the prosecution said would be accepted without the need for him to stand trial.</p> <p>Six other men have also been charged in connection with the investigation. Paul English, 61, Jake Reeves, 23, Nii Kojo Mensah, 22, Jakeem Barrington Rose, 22, and Ugnius Asmena, 19, are all charged with aggravated arson in connection with the fire in Leyton on 20 March. The charge states the men \u201cdamaged by fire commercial premises belonging to Mr X intending to destroy such property and being reckless as to whether life would be endangered\u201d.</p> <p>English, who appeared in the dock beside Earl, denied the charge, as did Mensah and Rose, who appeared together via a video link from HMP Wormwood Scrubs.</p> <p>Asmena and Reeves, who also appeared in the link were not arraigned on the arson charge. Reeves has also been charged with preparatory conduct and agreeing to accept a material benefit from a foreign intelligence service under the National Security Act.</p> <p>Rose has previously pleaded guilty to possession of a knife in a public place.</p> <p>Dmitrijus Paulauskas, 22, has previously pleaded not guilty to failing to disclose information to police about terrorist acts, contrary to section 38B of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p> <p>The defendants, except Earl, will appear at a hearing on 22 November. A trial date has been set for 2 June 2025 at the Old Bailey.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A British man, 20, has pleaded guilty to an offence under the new National Security Act and an arson attack on a Ukraine-linked business. Dylan Earl, from Elmesthorpe in Leicestershire, admitted the charge in relation to a fire in March at an east London warehouse belonging to a man only referred to in court as Mr X, the Old Bailey heard. Earl is believed to be the first person to be convicted of an offence under the National Security Act 2023 after pleading guilty to preparatory conduct to commit acts involving serious violence and endangering life in the UK. He was the first person to be charged under Section 18 of the act, which was introduced in response to the threat of hostile activity from states targeting the UK. Earl was accused in previous court hearings of carrying out the act on behalf of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, which the UK has proscribed as a terrorist organisation. Wearing a blue shirt and dark tie, Earl spoke to confirm his name and enter pleas to three charges. He denied one count of assisting a foreign intelligence service, which the prosecution said would be accepted without the need for him to stand trial. Six other men have also been charged in connection with the investigation. Paul English, 61, Jake Reeves, 23, Nii Kojo Mensah, 22, Jakeem Barrington Rose, 22, and Ugnius Asmena, 19, are all charged with aggravated arson in connection with the fire in Leyton on 20 March. The charge states the men \u201cdamaged by fire commercial premises belonging to Mr X intending to destroy such property and being reckless as to whether life would be endangered\u201d. English, who appeared in the dock beside Earl, denied the charge, as did Mensah and Rose, who appeared together via a video link from HMP Wormwood Scrubs. Asmena and Reeves, who also appeared in the link were not arraigned on the arson charge. Reeves has also been charged with preparatory conduct and agreeing to accept a material benefit from a foreign intelligence service under the National Security Act. Rose has previously pleaded guilty to possession of a knife in a public place. Dmitrijus Paulauskas, 22, has previously pleaded not guilty to failing to disclose information to police about terrorist acts, contrary to section 38B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The defendants, except Earl, will appear at a hearing on 22 November. A trial date has been set for 2 June 2025 at the Old Bailey.",

      "bodyText": "Late-night hosts talk the former White House chief of staff John Kelly calling Donald Trump a fascist and Tucker Carlson\u2019s bizarre rant about spanking on the campaign trail. Seth Meyers Seth Meyers devoted his Thursday Closer Look segment to the bombshell political story of the week: a New York Times interview with John Kelly, in which the former White House chief of staff said Donald Trump expressed admiration for Hitler and his generals. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we as a society have fully absorbed the magnitude of this story, given the way the media has been covering it,\u201d the Late Night host said before a clip of CNN following up the story with a report on Eminem campaigning for Kamala Harris. \u201cYou can\u2019t follow up a story as insane as \u2018presidential candidate praises Hitler\u2019 with fun wordplay about Eminem,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cIf the first story is the next president could be a Hitler-lover, then just don\u2019t have a second story. That\u2019s enough to fill an hour.\u201d \u201cI get it can be tough to figure out how to cover something like this, because like all Trump revelations it\u2019s both shocking and not at all surprising,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we\u2019re left in this weird middle ground where you\u2019re reporting something that everyone basically knows already, but it\u2019s also still insane. It\u2019s like going through a haunted house with a group of friends that used to work there.\u201d Naturally, Republicans are scrambling to normalize the situation. Meyers played a clip of the New Hampshire governor, Chris Sununu, who said on CNN: \u201cLook, we\u2019ve heard a lot of extreme things about Donald Trump from Donald Trump. It\u2019s kinda par for the course. It\u2019s really, unfortunately, with a guy like that, it\u2019s really baked into the vote.\u201d \u201cHis love of Adolf Hitler is baked in?\u201d Meyers marveled. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying, \u2018Look, that dead rat is baked into this loaf of sourdough. What are you going to do, go all the way back to the bakery?\u2019 If it\u2019s baked in, then don\u2019t eat the thing it\u2019s baked into! \u201cThis is not a complicated story,\u201d he concluded. \u201cTrump is a fascist who likes other fascists and wants to emulate fascism. If you\u2019re shrugging that off as baked in, then you\u2019re just saying that you\u2019re OK with fascism. If you\u2019re still supporting Trump, just admit that you think fascism is cool.\u201d Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert noted that Trump will hold a rally at Madison Square Garden this weekend. \u201cJust what New Yorkers need \u2013 more garbage around Penn Station,\u201d he joked. The rally is \u201cconfusing\u201d, as \u201cNew York is not what you call a swing state,\u201d he said. Trump trails Kamala Harris by 19 points in the state \u2013 \u201cor as the New York Jets say, not bad!\u201d Colbert quipped. Given the interview with Kelly this week, in 10 days, \u201cwe all get to find out whether we live in a fascist country\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good feeling, but definitely the feeling. And if you\u2019re feeling the same way, you\u2019re not alone.\u201d Colbert played a clip from CNN\u2019s presidential town hall in which Anderson Cooper asked Harris whether she thought Trump was a fascist; she replied: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump was joined on the campaign trail by the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who made his case for the former president with a bizarre rant about spanking. \u201cDad comes home. He\u2019s pissed. Dad is pissed. And when dad gets home, you know what he says? \u2018You\u2019ve been a bad girl. You\u2019ve been a bad little girl, and you\u2019re getting a vigorous spanking right now,\u2019\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI just can\u2019t figure out why they\u2019re having trouble appealing to female voters,\u201d Colbert deadpanned. \u201cNot to fact-check you there, Tuck, but we know from Stormy Daniels that Daddy is the one who likes to get spanked.\u201d Overall, \u201cthat was an upsetting little monologue,\u201d Colbert concluded. \u201cAngry Daddies punishing little girls? I\u2019m guessing when Tucker wrote that, he was vigorously spanking something.\u201d The Daily Show And on The Daily Show, the guest host Michael Kosta also mocked Carlson\u2019s bizarre spanking speech. Carlson began his speech with a cackle, delighting in what he said was his first appearance at a political rally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a hater \u2013 he\u2019s excited for his first political rally. Seems like a perfectly reasonable time to laugh like an old-timey villain who tied a woman to the railroad tracks,\u201d Kosta joked. And then he played one of Carlson\u2019s most offending lines: \u201cYou\u2019ve been a bad little girl and you\u2019re getting a vigorous spanking, right now.\u201d \u201cThis might be why you\u2019ve never been invited to speak at a political rally before,\u201d said Kosta. \u201cYou see, America, these Trump people, they aren\u2019t weird. They just know that Trump is a big, strong daddy that\u2019s coming home to spank us all. Totally normal stuff! I can\u2019t wait to hear Tucker\u2019s thoughts on the economy \u2013 \u2018Inflation is like a babysitter, and she\u2019s been naughty.\u2019\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Penguin bought the rights to Al Pacino\u2019s memoir in 2022 for $5m, it raised questions about the true value of Hollywood celebrity autobiography at a time when most stars happily spill sanctioned life highlights for free on social media.</p> <p>Yet it seems there remains a considerable premium on the value of stories from those actors who have kept themselves relatively private. Pacino\u2019s book, Sonny Boy, published last week, is boasting healthy hardback sales \u2013 it entered the Bookseller\u2019s top bestsellers list at No 9 \u2013 and a strikingly good trade in newspaper syndication.</p>    <p>The audiobook version is also doing considerable business, thanks to its author\u2019s \u201cHoo-ah!\u201d gusto and many wheezy chuckles. Such is Pacino\u2019s pacing, the audio format also offers considerable bang for the buck: 300-odd pages take him 12-and-a-half hours (the French audiobook, which is narrated by someone else, shaves two hours off that total).</p> <p>The book is at once candid and freewheeling, with his many romantic entanglements minimised, and lyrical remembrances of a hardscrabble childhood in the Bronx in the 1940s given considerable space. Here are some of Sonny Boy\u2019s most arresting highlights.</p> <h2><strong>He\u2019s \u2018still haunted\u2019 by a </strong><strong>74-year-old penis injury</strong></h2> <p>Aged 10, Pacino was tap-dancing along a rainy fence when he slipped and an \u201ciron bar hit me directly between the legs\u201d. He was in \u201csuch pain\u201d that a passerby carried him to his aunt\u2019s house where he lay on his bed and female relatives \u201cpoked and prodded at my penis in a semi-panic. I thought, God, please take me now.\u201d However, he confirms that it ultimately \u201cremained attached, along with the trauma\u201d. Four years later he was trapped under thin ice following another ill-advised bit of fancy footwork, but also survived.</p> <h2><strong>He has taken </strong><strong>fewer drugs than you might think</strong></h2> <p>No cocaine, ever: \u201cIt may surprise you to know I\u2019ve never touched the stuff.\u201d There was lots of Valium, and a little dabbling in harder stuff, but Pacino\u2019s relationship with drugs was coloured by the fact that his three closest childhood friends all died of heroin overdoses, and his mother died of an overdose when Pacino was 22.</p>    <h2><strong>He has long championed the </strong><strong>LGBTQ+ community</strong></h2> <p>First Pacino refused to shoot a scene in Dog Day Afternoon in which his character\u2019s transgender lover (played by Chris Sarandon) turns up in the middle of the bank robbery dressed as Marilyn Monroe and the pair kiss: \u201cThis is absurd \u2026 bullshit!\u201d Then he donated his fee from William Friedkin\u2019s Cruising, in which he plays a cop on the trail of a serial killer targeting gay men, to LGBTQ+ communities because he felt the film was exploitative.</p> <h2><strong>He insulted Jackie Kennedy</strong></h2> <p>One night in 1979, after a performance of Richard III, Pacino returned to his dressing room to find Jacqueline Kennedy and her daughter standing in front of him: \u201cSo elegant and beautiful, just radiating class. And as I slumped in my chair, I put out my hand for her to kiss it.\u201d We are not told whether she obliged, but Pacino does berate himself for the faux pas: \u201cPlease tell me, what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>He was kidnapped by a fan</strong></h2> <p>After he\u2019d been out drinking with Gene Hackman\u2019s brother in the 70s, a woman offered to take the lost and stumbling Pacino home. Once they were moving, he realised they were going in the wrong direction. \u201cShe said straight out, \u2018I\u2019m kidnapping you.\u2019\u201d Luckily his background had prepared him for such a situation. \u201cI am from the South Bronx. When I see some crazy person trying to do something to me, I know how to escape \u2026 This ain\u2019t happening to me, man.\u201d He opened the door as if to jump out \u2026 after which she did indeed drive him home.</p>    <h2><strong>The first time he went broke, he was saved by Diane Keaton</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t understand how money worked,\u201d writes Pacino. He was paid $35,000 for The Godfather; once shooting finished, he was still in debt and lived off his then-girlfriend, Jill Clayburgh. He earned more from The Godfather Part II and Dog Day Afternoon but spent the following decade \u201cspending and not earning; I was putting out but I wasn\u2019t bringing in\u201d.</p> <p>When things finally came to a head, Keaton, his girlfriend at the time, accompanied him to his attorney\u2019s office. \u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d she yelled at the lawyer. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s an artist.\u2019 No. <em>He. Is. An idiot</em>. He\u2019s an ignoramus. When it comes to this, you\u2019ve got to take care of him.\u201d She also supplied Pacino with the script for Sea of Love, the thriller that revived his fortunes.</p>    <h2><strong>The second time he went broke, he was saved by Adam Sandler</strong></h2> <p>In the mid 2000s, Pacino was installed in LA with three children and an unwieldy entourage. Among his expenses were 16 cars, 23 mobile phones, and a $400,000 landscaper for a house he didn\u2019t live in. He chartered a private jet to take everyone to Europe for a holiday. In London he rented out a whole floor of the Dorchester hotel so the children were near the sights. \u201cI had $50m, and then I had nothing. I had property, but I didn\u2019t have any money.\u201d So he fired his accountant and filmed the objectionable cross-dressing comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/08/jack-and-jill-review\">Jack and Jill</a>. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he writes, \u201cI did it because I didn\u2019t have anything else. Adam Sandler wanted me, and they paid me a lot for it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Rappers keep him solvent today</strong></h2> <p>Scarface was a flop on first release in 1982 but found a second wind thanks, thinks Pacino, to \u201cthe hip-hop generation\u201d. \u201cRap artists and their fans embraced the movie. They understood it and went with the metaphor. To this day it\u2019s still the biggest film I ever did. The residuals still support me. I can live on it. I mean, I could, if I lived like a normal person.\u201d</p>    <h2><strong>Tarantino doesn\u2019t rate him</strong></h2> <p>His 21-page dialogue scene with Leonardo DiCaprio in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood\">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a> was cut to two minutes.</p> <h2><strong>He didn\u2019t rate Star Wars</strong></h2> <p>Pacino was offered Han Solo and duly read the script, but turned it down, telling his manager: \u201cI can\u2019t make anything out of this.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Having a 16-month-old son when you\u2019re 84 is \u2018so much fun\u2019</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/16/al-pacino-baby-with-girlfriend-noor-alfallah\">Baby Roman</a> features at the end of the memoir: \u201cIt just gives me a chuckle every time I look at him.\u201d In interviews to promote the book, Pacino has suggested that much of their current interaction is online: \u201cHe does text me from time to time.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Actors are </strong><strong>\u2018the greatest of humans</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI know they call em crazy, self-centred, all that stuff. We even accuse them of narcissism. How foul.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Selfies are fine \u2013 just don\u2019t show him the photos</strong></h2>    <p>If someone wants a picture, Pacino will generally oblige: \u201cThey just see that you\u2019re famous. They don\u2019t see that you look like you\u2019ve been thrown out with the garbage.\u201d But ageing isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted, he says. \u201cNo matter how slim I get, I\u2019ve got a great big fat white head of hair.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>There is no afterlife</strong></h2> <p>When he contracted Covid in the early days of the pandemic, paramedics attended to Pacino and found he had no pulse, before managing to revive him. \u201cI believe I experienced death that day,\u201d he writes. \u201cI returned, and I can tell you there was nothing out there. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re here, then you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>",

The book is at once candid and freewheeling, with his many romantic entanglements minimised, and lyrical remembrances of a hardscrabble childhood in the Bronx in the 1940s given considerable space. Here are some of Sonny Boy\u2019s most arresting highlights. He\u2019s \u2018still haunted\u2019 by a 74-year-old penis injury Aged 10, Pacino was tap-dancing along a rainy fence when he slipped and an \u201ciron bar hit me directly between the legs\u201d. He was in \u201csuch pain\u201d that a passerby carried him to his aunt\u2019s house where he lay on his bed and female relatives \u201cpoked and prodded at my penis in a semi-panic. I thought, God, please take me now.\u201d However, he confirms that it ultimately \u201cremained attached, along with the trauma\u201d. Four years later he was trapped under thin ice following another ill-advised bit of fancy footwork, but also survived. He has taken fewer drugs than you might think No cocaine, ever: \u201cIt may surprise you to know I\u2019ve never touched the stuff.\u201d There was lots of Valium, and a little dabbling in harder stuff, but Pacino\u2019s relationship with drugs was coloured by the fact that his three closest childhood friends all died of heroin overdoses, and his mother died of an overdose when Pacino was 22. He has long championed the LGBTQ+ community First Pacino refused to shoot a scene in Dog Day Afternoon in which his character\u2019s transgender lover (played by Chris Sarandon) turns up in the middle of the bank robbery dressed as Marilyn Monroe and the pair kiss: \u201cThis is absurd \u2026 bullshit!\u201d Then he donated his fee from William Friedkin\u2019s Cruising, in which he plays a cop on the trail of a serial killer targeting gay men, to LGBTQ+ communities because he felt the film was exploitative. He insulted Jackie Kennedy One night in 1979, after a performance of Richard III, Pacino returned to his dressing room to find Jacqueline Kennedy and her daughter standing in front of him: \u201cSo elegant and beautiful, just radiating class. And as I slumped in my chair, I put out my hand for her to kiss it.\u201d We are not told whether she obliged, but Pacino does berate himself for the faux pas: \u201cPlease tell me, what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d He was kidnapped by a fan After he\u2019d been out drinking with Gene Hackman\u2019s brother in the 70s, a woman offered to take the lost and stumbling Pacino home. Once they were moving, he realised they were going in the wrong direction. \u201cShe said straight out, \u2018I\u2019m kidnapping you.\u2019\u201d Luckily his background had prepared him for such a situation. \u201cI am from the South Bronx. When I see some crazy person trying to do something to me, I know how to escape \u2026 This ain\u2019t happening to me, man.\u201d He opened the door as if to jump out \u2026 after which she did indeed drive him home. The first time he went broke, he was saved by Diane Keaton \u201cI didn\u2019t understand how money worked,\u201d writes Pacino. He was paid $35,000 for The Godfather; once shooting finished, he was still in debt and lived off his then-girlfriend, Jill Clayburgh. He earned more from The Godfather Part II and Dog Day Afternoon but spent the following decade \u201cspending and not earning; I was putting out but I wasn\u2019t bringing in\u201d. When things finally came to a head, Keaton, his girlfriend at the time, accompanied him to his attorney\u2019s office. \u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d she yelled at the lawyer. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s an artist.\u2019 No. He. Is. An idiot. He\u2019s an ignoramus. When it comes to this, you\u2019ve got to take care of him.\u201d She also supplied Pacino with the script for Sea of Love, the thriller that revived his fortunes. The second time he went broke, he was saved by Adam Sandler In the mid 2000s, Pacino was installed in LA with three children and an unwieldy entourage. Among his expenses were 16 cars, 23 mobile phones, and a $400,000 landscaper for a house he didn\u2019t live in. He chartered a private jet to take everyone to Europe for a holiday. In London he rented out a whole floor of the Dorchester hotel so the children were near the sights. \u201cI had $50m, and then I had nothing. I had property, but I didn\u2019t have any money.\u201d So he fired his accountant and filmed the objectionable cross-dressing comedy Jack and Jill. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he writes, \u201cI did it because I didn\u2019t have anything else. Adam Sandler wanted me, and they paid me a lot for it.\u201d Rappers keep him solvent today Scarface was a flop on first release in 1982 but found a second wind thanks, thinks Pacino, to \u201cthe hip-hop generation\u201d. \u201cRap artists and their fans embraced the movie. They understood it and went with the metaphor. To this day it\u2019s still the biggest film I ever did. The residuals still support me. I can live on it. I mean, I could, if I lived like a normal person.\u201d Tarantino doesn\u2019t rate him His 21-page dialogue scene with Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was cut to two minutes. He didn\u2019t rate Star Wars Pacino was offered Han Solo and duly read the script, but turned it down, telling his manager: \u201cI can\u2019t make anything out of this.\u201d Having a 16-month-old son when you\u2019re 84 is \u2018so much fun\u2019 Baby Roman features at the end of the memoir: \u201cIt just gives me a chuckle every time I look at him.\u201d In interviews to promote the book, Pacino has suggested that much of their current interaction is online: \u201cHe does text me from time to time.\u201d Actors are \u2018the greatest of humans\u2019 \u201cI know they call em crazy, self-centred, all that stuff. We even accuse them of narcissism. How foul.\u201d Selfies are fine \u2013 just don\u2019t show him the photos If someone wants a picture, Pacino will generally oblige: \u201cThey just see that you\u2019re famous. They don\u2019t see that you look like you\u2019ve been thrown out with the garbage.\u201d But ageing isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted, he says. \u201cNo matter how slim I get, I\u2019ve got a great big fat white head of hair.\u201d There is no afterlife When he contracted Covid in the early days of the pandemic, paramedics attended to Pacino and found he had no pulse, before managing to revive him. \u201cI believe I experienced death that day,\u201d he writes. \u201cI returned, and I can tell you there was nothing out there. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re here, then you\u2019re not.\u201d",

Now the billionaire entrepreneur is taking a punt on online sports betting, the Guardian has learned, through a partnership with an offshore gambling firm that is on the comeback trail after having its licence suspended in 2020. EasyBet is a joint-venture with Matchbook, a trading name of Triplebet, which is based on the Channel island of Alderney. The Guardian understands that Triplebet is owned by Zeljko Ranogajec, an Australian-born multimillionaire who has been described as the world\u2019s most successful gambler and by the nicknames of the \u201cLoch Ness monster\u201d, because he is rarely spotted, and \u201cThe Joker\u201d. Russia\u2019s central bank has hiked interest rates today, as it tries to cool inflation. The Bank of Russia increased its key interest rates to 21%, from 19%, warning that \u201cfurther tightening of monetary policy\u201d was needed to reduce price pressures. The Bank says: Inflation is running considerably above the Bank of Russia\u2019s July forecast. Inflation expectations continue to increase. Growth in domestic demand is significantly outstripping the capabilities to expand the supply of goods and services. Additional fiscal spending and the related expansion of the federal budget deficit in 2024 have proinflationary effects. Over on Wall Street, the tech-focused Nasdaq index has hit a new alltime high. The Nasdaq has gained 1.4% today to a new peak, as investors continue to snap up tech stocks. Yesterday, the Nasdaq was lifted by Tesla\u2019s best day in a decade \u2013 its shares jumped 17% after its Q3 earnings report, and on strong forward guidance on vehicle growth for 2025. The pound and the euro could both suffer more losses against the US dollar if Donald Trump wins the US presidency, suggests Mark Dowding of RBC BlueBay Asset Management. Given that one of the largest policy differences between Harris and Trump relates to trade and tariff policies, we could easily see a differential of 5-10% in major dollar crosses, depending on who wins 11 days from now. In this case, we think that a move below $1.20 on cable [the pound/dollar exchange rate] and towards parity versus the euro is possible, on a Trump victory. Consumer confidence across the US has risen, bucking the trend in the UK, as the presidential election looms. The University of Michigan\u2019s index of consumer sentiment has risen to 70.5 this month, up from September\u2019s 70.1. That\u2019s the third monthly rise in a row, taking confidence to its highest since April. This month\u2019s increase was primarily due to modest improvements in buying conditions for durables, in part due to easing interest rates. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu says the upcoming election looms large over consumer expectations: Overall, the share of consumers expecting a Harris presidency fell from 63% last month to 57% in October. Sentiment of Republicans, who believe that a Trump presidency would be better for the economy, rose 8% on growing confidence that their preferred candidate would be the next president. In contrast, sentiment declined 1% for Democrats. As usual, Independents remain in between, with a 4% gain in sentiment this month. Regardless of the eventual winner, a sizable share of consumers will likely update their economic expectations based on the results of the election. With winter approaching, European gas prices have risen to their highest level of 2024 \u2013 but are still much lower than a year ago. The European benchmark gas contract has risen to \u20ac43.30 per megawatt hour today, the highest since last December. But, that\u2019s still lower than October 2023 when gas traded above \u20ac50 per megawatt hour. Back in the UK, high street clothes shop White Stuff has been acquired by South African-based retailer The Foschini Group (TFG). The deal is thought to be worth around \u00a350m, PA Media reports. TFG already owns the Hobbs, Whistles and Phase Eight fashion brands, and will keep White Stuff chief executive Jo Jenkins in her current role. TFG\u2019s CEO, Justin Hampshire, says: \u201cWith White Stuff\u2019s strong presence on the high street and significant potential for sustained growth, we are committed to supporting Jo and her talented team with their ambitious rollout strategy to further increase its store and concession estate. \u201cSimultaneously, TFG London will continue to invest in the White Stuff brand and online offer to drive further awareness and growth.\u201d Orders for long-lasting goods, from electronics and furniture to transport vehicles, dipped at US factories last month. US durable goods orders fell 0.8% in September, a slightly smaller fall than expected. Excluding transport, orders were up 0.4% \u2013 suggesting that weaker demand for aircraft was a factor (as the Boeing strike continues). Olivia Cross, North America Economist at Capital Economics, says: While the fall in durable goods orders in September was mostly due to the volatile transportation components, the decline in underlying capital goods shipments will still drag on business equipment investment. The surge in aircraft shipments earlier in the quarter probably prevented overall business equipment from declining in the third quarter, but the weak September data set the stage for a softer fourth quarter. The UK Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling in the motor finance case has also hit shares in Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds, a major supplier of motor finance, are down 4.5%, UK fizzy wine maker Chapel Down has been hit by the wet summer this year. The Kent-based winery has told the City today that it expects the 2024 Harvest to be approximately 1,875 tonnes, just half the 3,811 tonnes achieved last year. It says growing conditions for 2024 started well, with no frost damage during early spring, and fine, warm weather during flowering. But\u2026 \u2026the 2024 vintage has faced more difficult weather conditions in September and October. Although our vineyards were not impacted as heavily as other regions in England, late season weather has led to some pressure from mildew and consequently reduced yields, given our strict focus on quality. As the company has stockpiled wine from previous vintages, future sales plans will not be impacted by stock availability, it says. Chapel Down has also concluded a strategic review of its future, and not found any transactions that would create superior long term shareholder value than remaining a stand-alone company on the AIM index. Shares in the company have dropped by around 18%. The UK Court of Appeal has ruled in favour of three car buyers in a landmark case over the supply of motor finance. In a significant ruling, the Appeal Court has concluded that motor dealers acting as credit brokers have a fiduciary duty to their customers. The case centred on the practice where motor dealers would arrange finance so a customer could buy a car on credit, and receives a commission from the lender. The three complainants were student nurse Amy Hopcraft, factory supervisor Marcus Johnson, and Andrew Wrench, dubbed \u201ca postman with a penchant for fast cars\u201d by the Court of Appeal. The trio argued that the car dealers owed them a duty to provide impartial information, advice or recommendation, and sought the return of the commission paid to them as credit brokers. And the Court of Appeal has backed their case, saying: The dealers were the sellers of the cars, but they were also acting as credit brokers on behalf of the claimants. In the latter role, their task was to search for and offer the customer a finance deal from their panel of lenders which was suitable for their needs and competitive. In some cases they undertook to find the best deal or the one which was most suitable for the customer. The ruling could open the door for many more consumers to seek redress; the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has been conducting its own inquiry into the motor finance sector. Shares in Close Brothers, the financial services company which provided the finance to Hopcraft, have tumbled by around 20% this morning. Close Brothers has told the City that it \u201cdisagrees with the Court\u2019s extension of the existing case law in this area\u201d, and plans to appeal this decision to the UK Supreme Court. In the meantime, it is also temporarily pausing the writing of new UK motor finance business while it reviews its processes to ensure they comply with today\u2019s ruling. Kavon Hussain, principal of Consumer Rights Solicitors who brought the cases to the Court of Appeal, reckon that billions of pounds of commissions could be clawed back. Hussain says: Unknown to customers, lenders systematically incentivised car dealers acting as credit brokers to place finance with them by paying commissions that were not disclosed to the consumer. \u201cThese hidden commissions paid to dealers meant that the consumer could pay anything from a few hundred pounds to many thousands extra to a lender through interest payments, for the lender to then pay this to the dealer. \u201cIt was, and still is, a broken system which rewarded the lenders paying the largest commission to the ultimate detriment of the normal man in the street who went to buy a car on finance. \u201cThis Court of Appeal judgement is going to affect every lender in the market. We already have a substantial amount of clients with claims waiting to go.\u201d Although UK borrowing costs have risen this week, in the run-up to the budget, there\u2019s no sign of a mini-budget-style \u201cMoron Premium\u201d being applied to gilts. That suggsts the markets are pretty confortable with Rachel Reeves\u2019s fiscal plans, at this stage anyway. Simon French, chief economist at investment bank Panmure Liberum, explains all in this thread: Shares in the fashion company behind Versace and Jimmy Choo have almost halved in pre-market trading, after a US judge blocked its merger with handbag maker Tapestry. Tapestry had planned to acquire Capri Holdings, which also owns the Michael Kors brand, in an $8.5bn deal. But the plan has been thwarted, after a federal judge agreed with regulators that the deal would hurt competition in the handbag industry. The pound is set for its worst month in over a year against the dollar. Sterling has lost 2.9% so far during October, which would be its weakest month against the greenback since September 2023. The pound began October at $1.3370, but is currently trading almost four cents lower at $1.298. It weakened as traders anticipated faster interest rate cuts from the Bank of England, and nervous investors sought the safety of the US dollar given geopolitical fears. Uncertainty over next week\u2019s budget may also be hurting the pound. But Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, reckons it\u2019s mainly about the stronger dollar. The backdrop to this Budget is one of a weakening pound and rising bond yields. Over the past month, GBP/USD has fallen more than 3%, as the dollar has dominated the G10 FX space. This move lower in GBP/USD, is mostly down to dollar strength rather than weakness in sterling, which has performed in the middle of the G10 FX pack for the past month. London\u2019s stock market is ending the week in subdued fashion, with the FTSE 100 index dipping by 0.07% (or 5 points, to 8263 points) and the smaller FTSE 250 flat. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says: \u201cThe FTSE 100 dipped lower on Friday morning, undone by some weakness in the energy and housebuilding sectors. This followed some pretty dire figures on consumer confidence with households in a downbeat mood ahead of next week\u2019s Budget and the long-heralded \u2018difficult decisions\u2019 it might contain. Fewer businesses are being created \u2013 or closed down \u2013 in the UK than last year, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows. The ONS reports that the number of businesses created in July-September 2024 was 3.7% lower than in Quarter 3 2023. There was a decrease in creations in 13 out of 16 main industrial groups, with the most significant decreases coming from the construction, and transport and storage industries. Business closures fell by 4.2% year-on-year, the ONS adds. Better news from Germany: business morale has picked up this month. The Ifo institute said its business climate index increased to 86.5 in October, up from 85.4 last month. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 85.6, so this is better than forecast \u2013 but still weak\u2026. Analyst at Goldman Sachs predict Rachel Reeves will announce higher spending in next week\u2019s budget \u2013 partly to protect departments from cuts \u2013 funded by a higher tax take. In a research note, GS\u2019s James Moberly says: We expect next week\u2019s (October 30th) Autumn Budget to see the government upgrade current spending by around \u00a330bn per year (0.9% of FY2029 GDP) by the end of the forecast horizon given in-year overspends and the need to revise up the spending growth rate to prevent real-terms cuts to unprotected departments\u2019 budgets. Moberly explains that most of this increase will be funded by higher revenues, as the chancellor is committed to balancing the current budget. We expect the government to announce tax increases worth roughly \u00a325bn per year (0.75% of FY2029 GDP) by the end of the forecast horizon. In addition to the manifesto pledges on tax, the government could raise revenues through reforms to capital gains and inheritance tax, removing the National Insurance exemption on employer pension contributions, and extending the freeze on personal income tax thresholds. Moberly adds that changing the UK\u2019s debt metric to public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL), as we expect, would give Reeves around \u00a350bn of headroom while still ensuring debt falls as a share of GDP five years ahead. That increase will come gradually, he predicts: We think that the Chancellor would be very unlikely to use all the resulting fiscal space and would instead leave a much larger margin of headroom against the debt rule. Nonetheless, with the debt rule unlikely to bind, there is considerable uncertainty around exactly how much public investment could increase. We think that an increase of around \u00a325bn a year (0.75% of FY2029 GDP) by the end of the forecast horizon relative to the Spring Budget plans is most likely. That said, we think that this increase would be phased in gradually over several years. Profits have tumbled at German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz, as demand from China and its home market both weaken. Mercedes-Benz has reported a 53% drop in net profits in the last three months, to \u20ac1.719bn, in a quarter which saw \u201ca challenging market environment and fierce competition, particularly in China\u201d. Group revenues fell 6.7%, including a 16.6% drop in China \u2013 and a near-25% decline in Germany. Harald Wilhelm, chief financial officer of Mercedes-Benz Group, isn\u2019t sugar-coating the figures, saying: The Q3 results do not meet our ambitions. Nonetheless Mercedes-Benz continues to generate solid cash flows even in challenging times. We are taking a prudent view about market evolution going forward and we will step up all efforts on further efficiency increases and cost improvements across the business. Rachel Reeves\u2019s plans to shake up the UK\u2019s fiscal rules to allow more borrowing for investment are not rocking the bond market today. The prices, and thus the yields, on UK government debt are basically unchanged this morning. There was a small rise in yields yesterday, as traders anticipated higher borrowing, but that wasn\u2019t a major move either. NatWest has rounded off the UK bank reporting season by beating City expectations, sending its shares to their highest level in almost a decade. NatWest reported a 26% rise in pre-tax operating profits for the third quarter of the year to nearly \u00a31.7bn, up from \u00a31.3bn. Chief executive Paul Thwaite says that customer activity is increasing, while defaults remaining low: As the UK\u2019s biggest bank for business, and one that serves millions of households, NatWest Group plays a key role in driving economic growth across the UK. Throughout the third quarter of 2024, we have grown our lending, helping customers to buy or remortgage their homes or to start and grow their businesses. NatWest has bumped up its forecasts, now predicting a return on tangible equity greater than 15% this year, up from a previous forecast of 14%. Shares have jumped over 4%, trading as high as 378.9p, the highest since 2015. They\u2019re still a long way below their pre-financial crisis levels, though, when the company was known as Royal Bank of Scotland, and was bailed out by the taxpayer. Government ministers are out defending Rachel Reeves\u2019s plan to change the measure used for Britain\u2019s debt target, to allow billions of pounds more borrowing within the fiscal rules. As we covered yesterday, the chancellor confirmed that next week\u2019s budget will include a new method for assessing the UK\u2019s debt position, during her visit to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Annual Meeting. Reeves didn\u2019t confirm what the new measure would be, but the Guardian has been told by a senior government source that she will target public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL), a measure which recognises the value of investing in assets. Yesterday\u2019s announcement sparked a row (dubbed the \u2018persnuffle\u2019 kerfuffle by the Independent), with former chancellor Jeremy Hunt claiming extra borrowing could push up borrowing costs, hurting households with mortgages. This morning, Treasury secretary James Murray has insisted that Reeves\u2019s plan was in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto promises, and would lead to more investment. Murray told Times Radio: \u201cWhat the Chancellor was setting out is what we pledged to do in our manifesto around fiscal rules.\u201d He added: What the Chancellor has said is the second of her fiscal rules, the investment rule, will make sure that we measure debt differently to recognise the value of assets, not just the cost of investment. \u201cBecause what\u2019s crucial is that we have investment in this country that will underpin greater growth in the years ahead.\u201d Thames Water\u2019s bonds are rising in early trading, after it announced a proposal to extend its liquidity runway. However, prices remain low \u2013 reflecting the fact that Thames credit rating is at junk levels. Reuters has the details: The company\u2019s April 2027 euro-denominated bond rose 0.27 pence in price to 78.316 pence, the highest since Aug 21, on the Tradeweb platform. Its May 2027 sterling-denominated bonds rose 0.279 pence to 13.474 pence on Tradeweb. Struggling utility Thames Water has announced plans for a \u00a33bn financial lifeline to help it avoid collapse. Thames told the City this morning that the proposal \u2013 to raise money from its creditors \u2013 would improve its \u201cliquidity runway\u201d until October 2025, with the possibility of a further extention to May 2026 if regulators agreed. Under the plan, some of Thames\u2019s creditors would provide an initial tranche of \u00a31.5bn, with the possibility of another \u00a31.5bn once Ofwat has made its \u201cFinal Determination\u201d, laying out how much Thames can raise bills by. In a boost for Thames, which is struggling under a \u00a315bn debt pile, the plan would extend the maturities of all Class A Debt and Class B Debt by two years. The company says that creditors representing around \u00a36.7bn of its Secured Debt are backing the plan. It is seeking the support of more creditors, through a transaction support agreement announced this morning. Yesterday, Reuters reported that a group of Thames creditors were proposing an alternative liquidity package to give the company more time to restructure its debts. Last month, Thames admitted it could run out of cash as soon as December. Today, the company say it is working hard to get onto a stable financial footing. Sir Adrian Montague, Chairman of Thames Water said: \u201cThe Board and leadership team remain focused on stabilising the business and today\u2019s announcement is an important step in the process to increase its long-term financial resilience. There will be further stages and we will continue to work collaboratively with our many stakeholders as we look to attract new equity into the business and seek a final determination that enables the delivery of our ambitious business plan for the next five years.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK consumers are in a \u201cdespondent mood\u201d ahead as households brace for tax rises in the Budget next week, amid fears that Britain could be entering a \u201cvibecession\u201d. Research firm GfK\u2019s monthly survey of consumer morale shows confidence has slipped this month, to -21 points, the joint lowest this year. It found that households are gloomier about the general economic situation of the country during the last 12 months, and also over the next year. Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at GfK, reckons consumers are \u2018holding their breath\u201d ahead of next Wednesday\u2019s budget statement, explaining: \u201cConsumer confidence fell one point this month to -21, taking the score back down to the level last seen in March this year. Also falling one point are both personal financial situation over the last 12 months and general economic situation over the next 12 months. The largest drop though was in our view of the general economic situation over the last 12 months, down five points to -42. On the plus side, the major purchase index rose two points and future personal financial expectations by one point. As the Budget statement looms, consumers are in a despondent mood despite a fall in the headline rate of inflation. This month\u2019s Consumer Confidence Barometer paints a picture of people holding their breath to see what\u2019s in store for them on 30th October.\u201d Although Labour ruled out increasing taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d, various revenue-raising measures could be in the chancellor\u2019s sights, such as capital gains tax (CGT), inheritance tax, employer national insurance contributions, and fuel duty. A similar poll from PwC yesterday showed the same picture. Its consumer sentiment index dropped to the lowest level in 2024, led by \u201cnotable declines\u201d among those over 65 and the lowest socioeconomic groups. Over 70% of people polled by PwC are planning to make short-term spending cutbacks, and more households plan to spend less on Christmas presents and celebrations than those who say they\u2019ll spend more. The drop in confidence comes despite the easing of cost of living pressures recently, with inflation dropping to 1.7% last month. Lisa Hooker, PwC\u2019s leader of industry for Consumer Markets, says: \u201cBeing first recognised in the US, we are seeing the impact of \u2018vibecession\u2019 in the UK where, despite falling inflation and interest rates and consumers being better off, sentiment has started to fall again. Whether the starting point was the unrest across the UK in early August, the unseasonably awful summer weather or a combination of several factors, the typical post-election honeymoon vanished quickly, to be replaced by trepidation, particularly about the upcoming budget.\u201d The mood isn\u2019t much cheerier in the business world, either. Yesterday, the CBI reported that sentiment across the manufacturing sector fell in October, at the fastest pace in two years. According to data provider S&amp;P Global, confidence across the private sector has dipped to its lowest since November 2023.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people applying for visas in the UK have been unlawfully charged for language tests, the government has disclosed, but the Home Office is continuing to demand the fees because it needs the money. The Home Office minister Seema Malhotra made the admission to a Lords committee as the government scrambled to address what it described as a \u201cchallenging\u201d situation. A company called Ecctis Ltd has been charging fees for language tests and qualification assessments to fund visa services since 2008 without any legal authority, leaving the system open to challenge in the courts. The discovery was made when the government sought to renew the company\u2019s contract this year. The Home Office is now seeking to rush through legislation to make it legal to charge up to \u00a3400 for the tests. Ministers are also looking at either establishing a \u201crestitution\u201d scheme, whereby millions of pounds could be reimbursed to visa applicants, or tabling retrospective legislation to avoid a payout. The House of Lords secondary legislation scrutiny committee, which is examining a proposed change to the law to make future charges legal, said it was shocked to discover that in the meantime the Home Office was continuing to bill visa applicants for the services. Malhotra had informed the committee that it was \u201cimportant to note that suspension of charging for these services would have significant potential impacts on the public purse\u201d. She wrote: \u201cGiven the options under consideration and the significant impacts associated with suspending charging for these services, the department has determined that fees should continue to be charged until such a time as the position in respect of previously charged fees is confirmed. \u201cThis will also serve to ensure there is consistency of treatment in both the fees that have been historically charged and those charged in the period between the issue being identified and the appropriate legislation coming into force. The department, however, appreciates the challenging nature of this position given the lack of extant legal authority for the charging of these fees, and is working at pace to clarify the position.\u201d The government has informed the Lords committee that it does not know how many people have been affected nor what the cost of refunding them might be but that Ecctis earned \u00a350m from such fees over the last three years. The Lords committee has criticised the new government for its lack of transparency over the situation and its treatment of visa applicants. It wrote: \u201cWe are shocked that the Home Office puts more weight on consistency with the past approach \u2013 which is known to be unlawful \u2013 than on consistency with the law as it stands today. We welcome the Home Office considering options for those who have paid inappropriately in the past, but we are concerned about the treatment of current users paying fees now.\u201d Applicants for a wide range of UK visas must prove their proficiency in English or that they have the appropriate qualifications to work for a designated employer in the UK. Ecctis, a not-for-profit company that manages a number of national agencies, charges \u00a3140 plus VAT for English language proficiency tests and \u00a3210 plus VAT for qualification equivalency assessments. Naga Kandiah, a public law solicitor at MTC Solicitors, said the government was mistreating applicants who were already paying large sums for their visas. He said: \u201cDuring the current financial crises, it is unfair to place an extra burden on visa applicants to pay fees to sit the English language tests. This is despite the Home Office increasing visa fees to one of the highest in Europe.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are taking steps to resolve an issue which was identified earlier this year with the legal arrangements for charging fees for English language proficiency and qualification equivalency assessment services. \u201cWe are currently considering all available options and engaging with other government departments to resolve the issue, and we will update parliament on an agreed approach in due course.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brexit has added up to \u00a3370m a year to the price of power supplies from Europe, according to industry representatives who calculate that the total energy costs of leaving the EU could amount to \u00a310bn by the end of the decade. Energy UK, the sector\u2019s trade body, has called on Keir Starmer to negotiate a closer trading relationship with the bloc as part of the \u201creset\u201d he is seeking with Brussels. Before Brexit, the UK procured power through the EU\u2019s internal electricity market, which brought together bids and offers in a system known as \u201csingle day-ahead coupling\u201d, using an algorithm to optimise pricing and flows. The UK imports and exports electricity through interconnectors \u2013 huge undersea cables \u2013 to Norway, Ireland, France, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands. After the post-Brexit trade deal came into force in January 2021, the British market was no longer part of the algorithmic system, reducing the efficiency of trading and pushing up costs. \u201cOne of the unfortunate consequences of Brexit is that we have been left with these very inefficient trading arrangements, and there is a cost to that,\u201d said Energy UK\u2019s deputy director, Kisha Couchman. \u201cThere\u2019s been upwards of somewhere between \u00a3100m and \u00a3370m and that has ultimately been borne by the consumer,\u201d she told a British Irish Chamber of Commerce conference in Dublin. The price increase is another consequence of leaving the single market under the \u201chard Brexit\u201d sought and sealed by Boris Johnson\u2019s government in late 2020. Energy UK said relinking the UK to a unified trading operation would not only reduce the cost of electricity, but also create a \u201cgreater incentive for decarbonisation across both jurisdictions\u201d. It said a return to a more efficient import and export arrangement would benefit both the UK and the EU as they strive to achieve net zero by 2050. \u201cLinkage is critical for the UK and EU industries and is supported by British and European industry and civil society alike. This should be a priority for the new UK government to address,\u201d it said in a recent report. In a briefing issued this week, Energy UK said : \u201cUnless the UK moves toward closer cooperation with the EU on energy and climate it may lead to additional costs of up to \u00a310bn this parliament through higher energy bills and lower Treasury revenues,\u201d it said. It calculated that energy trading outside the bloc was costing the UK \u00a3120m to \u00a3370m a year. It also estimates a further \u00a3800m in carbon tax charges the EU plans to introduce on imports from 2026. According to its analysis, the Treasury will lose between \u00a3900m and \u00a32.4bn in revenue a year as a result of a reduction in demand for UK energy that new emissions trading rules are expected to trigger as the EU implements its carbon border adjustment mechanism in 2026. It notes the UK is likely to become a net exporter of electricity by 2030, but that the new carbon tax barriers \u201cwill make it harder for the UK to fulfil its potential\u201d. Previous research found that the change to trading arrangements over the interconnectors can add between 0.25% and 0.7% to wholesale costs, with \u00a390m to \u00a3250m added in 2021. A joint statement by Starmer and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, after their first meeting in Brussels earlier this month suggested that energy could be part of the \u201creset\u201d. \u201cThe leaders agreed the UK and EU would also continue to work closely to address wider global challenges including economic headwinds, geopolitical competition, irregular migration, climate change and energy prices, which pose fundamental challenges to the shared values of the UK and the EU and provide the strategic driver for stronger cooperation,\u201d the statement said.",

      "body": "<p>There is a good chance that in 10 days\u2019 time, Americans will elect the first fascist president of the United States. It sounds hyperbolic, it sounds hysterical. Indeed, for exactly those reasons, many of his opponents long held back from using that word about Donald Trump. But the hour is late. Voting is already under way. It\u2019s time to spell out what Trump has said and done, what he threatens to do, what he is.</p> <p>Put aside the personal grossness, on display again in recent days with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/22/donald-trump-rally-arnold-palmer-penis\">reference</a> to the size of the late Arnold Palmer\u2019s manhood. Put aside the fact that he\u2019s a twice-impeached, four times indicted, convicted felon who has been found <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/\">liable by a court</a> for rape. Put aside the latest accusations from a former model who says she met Trump through Jeffrey Epstein, and that the former president groped her in what she believed was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein\">\u201ctwisted game\u201d</a> between the two men.</p> <p>Focus instead on the F-word. In recent days, the taboo on that word has been broken, starting with a warning from a former head of the US military, Mark Milley, that the president he once served is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/bob-woodward-book-mark-milley-trump\">\u201cfascist to the core\u201d</a>. In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2024/oct/15/i-said-his-name-i-hope-i-dont-burn-in-hell-nancy-pelosi-podcast\">interview</a> a few days later, the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi told me she shared that view, and Kamala Harris herself has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/harris-trump-fascist-hitler-comments-election\">spoken in similar terms</a>. But this week came perhaps the most detailed, and therefore persuasive, deployment of that term.</p> <p>It came from a man who worked exceptionally closely with Trump, serving as his White House chief of staff: General John Kelly. Like Milley, Kelly did not use the word \u201cfascist\u201d to mean racist or really rightwing, as some loosely throw around that term, but rather to describe Trump\u2019s attitude to power. Indeed, Kelly took pains to be precise.</p> <p>In an interview with the New York Times, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html\">read aloud</a> a definition of fascism: \u201cIt\u2019s a far-right authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy,\u201d he said, adding that Trump fitted that description. \u201cIn my experience, those are the kinds of things that he thinks would work better in terms of running America.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not a stretch to speak of \u201cautocracy\u201d. Kelly and others have told how Trump believed all power should reside in him, how he bridled at the insistence by senior officials in the government or military, including those he called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/donald-trump-called-generals-call-threat-democracy-analysis-115078662\">my generals</a>\u201d, that their loyalty was to the constitution rather than to him personally. Trump saw that and all such constraints on his authority, including the law, as irritating \u2013 if not illegitimate.</p> <p>That was troubling enough in his first term, but it would be more alarming in a second. For one thing, Trump will not repeat his mistake of appointing lieutenants who believe their duty is to serve the country rather than him, even if that means thwarting his will. Next time, he will be surrounded by loyalists. Some of them have been remarkably candid about their plans. In the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/us/politics/trump-plans-2025.html\">words</a> of one, Russell T Vought, speaking of how Trump aims to take direct control of every corner of the US federal government, \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is identify the pockets of independence and seize them.\u201d</p> <p>An obvious early target will be the department of justice. Trump has left little doubt that he will not respect that body\u2019s independence. Instead he will use it as a weapon to get the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/05/i-am-your-retribution-trump-rules-supreme-at-cpac-as-he-relaunches-bid-for-white-house\">\u201cretribution\u201d</a> he has promised by prosecuting his enemies. What\u2019s more, a second-term Trump will be emboldened by an extraordinary ruling of the supreme court. In July that bench, remade in his image with three Trump-appointed judges, granted the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/01/supreme-court-decision-trump-immunity-ruling\">sweeping legal immunity</a>.</p> <p>What especially alarms the retired generals is Trump\u2019s repeated threats to use the US military against American citizens, to crush dissent. When the Black Lives Matter protests erupted in Washington DC in 2020, Trump sent in the national guard, but now he talks, explicitly, about going much further, promising to use the army against those he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/14/trump-military-enemy-within-armed-forces-election-day\">calls</a> \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d. When pressed to say who he had in mind, he did not cite terrorists or criminals but Adam Schiff, a Democratic congressman from California.</p> <p>The same instinct animates his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/business/media/trump-media-broadcast-licenses.html\">serial threats</a> to the free press. \u201cCBS should lose its license,\u201d Trump posted on social media last week, after the network displeased him with an interview with Harris: \u201c60 Minutes should be immediately taken off the air.\u201d Earlier he had called for ABC\u2019s licence to be \u201cterminated\u201d because he didn\u2019t like the way his debate with Harris had gone. Presidents cannot block TV networks on a whim, but they do appoint the board that hands out broadcast licences \u2013 so it\u2019s not an empty threat.</p> <p>This, remember, is a man who gushes like a teenager in his admiration for Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un, but rarely has a good word to say for America\u2019s democratic allies. This is a man who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/06/donald-trump-sean-hannity-dictator-day-one-response-iowa-town-hall\">promised</a> to be a dictator \u201con day one\u201d. What more does he have to do to tell us who he is, short of dressing up in jackboots and doing a Hitler salute? And before you dismiss that as a joke, recall Kelly\u2019s confirmation that, more than once, Trump spoke positively of the Nazi dictator: \u201cYou know, Hitler did some good things, too,\u201d he would say.</p> <p>Given all this, it should be shocking that Trump is even a contender for the White House, let alone one who, polls suggest, is locked in a tie with his opponent. But too many Americans are fed up with high prices and fearful about immigration; too many blame the incumbent Democratic administration and see Harris as part of that status quo. In that context it didn\u2019t help that, when asked if she would have done anything differently from Joe Biden these last four years, Harris <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/news/not-a-thing-that-comes-to-mind-harris-says-she-wouldnt-do-anything-differently-from-biden-over-past-four-years/\">replied</a>, \u201cNot a thing that comes to mind.\u201d</p> <p>In her closing argument, Harris is rightly focusing on the threat Trump poses to democracy and freedom. But she has to make that threat ever more concrete. Polls show she is losing ground among Black and Hispanic voters, especially men. Why not, as the Atlantic\u2019s Ron Brownstein has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/01/trump-liberal-america-reelection-law-enforcement/676136/\">argued</a>, remind those voters that Trump threatens to cut federal funding to police departments that don\u2019t implement \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d, a practice that disproportionately targets Black men? Or that Trump plans a door-to-door operation against undocumented immigrants, a programme of mass deportation that could see the rounding up of 11 million people? This is not a niche issue: there are 4 million young US citizens with at least one undocumented parent. And if you\u2019re wondering where they would all go, recall that Stephen Miller, one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html\">has said</a> that \u201cillegals\u201d awaiting deportation will be sent to massive internment camps.</p> <p>On Monday, Donald Trump will address a rally at Madison Square Garden. Others have already noted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/18/donald-trump-madison-square-garden-rally\">uncomfortable echo</a> of the vast America First rally held in that same venue in 1939, when an earlier variant of American fascism was at its height. The US, and the world, got lucky then, as that movement was steadily eclipsed by events. On 5 November, America and the world desperately need to get lucky again \u2013 and time is running out.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "There is a good chance that in 10 days\u2019 time, Americans will elect the first fascist president of the United States. It sounds hyperbolic, it sounds hysterical. Indeed, for exactly those reasons, many of his opponents long held back from using that word about Donald Trump. But the hour is late. Voting is already under way. It\u2019s time to spell out what Trump has said and done, what he threatens to do, what he is. Put aside the personal grossness, on display again in recent days with his reference to the size of the late Arnold Palmer\u2019s manhood. Put aside the fact that he\u2019s a twice-impeached, four times indicted, convicted felon who has been found liable by a court for rape. Put aside the latest accusations from a former model who says she met Trump through Jeffrey Epstein, and that the former president groped her in what she believed was a \u201ctwisted game\u201d between the two men. Focus instead on the F-word. In recent days, the taboo on that word has been broken, starting with a warning from a former head of the US military, Mark Milley, that the president he once served is a \u201cfascist to the core\u201d. In an interview a few days later, the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi told me she shared that view, and Kamala Harris herself has spoken in similar terms. But this week came perhaps the most detailed, and therefore persuasive, deployment of that term. It came from a man who worked exceptionally closely with Trump, serving as his White House chief of staff: General John Kelly.

On Friday, judges from the court of appeal ruled in favour of three borrowers whose cases were merged earlier this year, saying it was unlawful for lenders to have paid a commission to car dealers without the borrowers\u2019 knowledge. The ruling on the test case, which involved customers filing claims against FirstRand Bank and Close Brothers, said consumers needed to know all the material facts that could affect their borrowing decision including the total commission to car dealers, and how it was calculated, in order to be able to consent to the loan. The news sent Close Brothers shares down 15% on Friday afternoon, with the lender saying it would temporarily pause issuing new car loans while it reviewed the ruling. FirstRand said it was \u201cconcerned by the judgment and does not agree with its findings\u201d. Both companies said they intended to appeal against the ruling in the UK supreme court. The decision could have wide-ranging implications for car lenders across the UK, with some lawyers speculating that consumers could collectively receive billions of pounds in compensation, and in some cases have their car loan written off or rescinded. The decision could also influence the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s (FCA) investigation into whether commission arrangements made between 2007 and 2021 \u2013 the year they were banned \u2013 were harmful to consumers. The FCA will decide whether to take any further action, which could include launching a customer compensation scheme funded by the lenders that sat behind the arrangements, by May 2025.

      "body": "<p>A man from Northern Ireland who abused at least 70 children online and drove one to suicide has been sentenced to life in jail with a minimum term of 20 years in a \u201chorrific\u201d case that a judge said had caused \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d to young girls all over the world.</p> <p>Alexander McCartney, 26, admitted 185 charges including manslaughter, blackmail, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and producing and distributing indecent images of children.</p> <p>He was told he would spend at least 20 years in jail after a number of sentences that he will serve concurrently were taken into account.</p> <p>In one of the biggest investigations into \u201ccatfishing\u201d, or sexual extortion, in the world, police found victims aged between 10 and 16 in the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Prosecutors said McCartney had targeted about 3,500 children.</p> <p>He posed as a young girl to befriend other girls on Snapchat before blackmailing them, and is believed to be the UK\u2019s worst catfishing offender. </p> <p>Sitting at Belfast crown court, the judge, Justice O\u2019Hara, said: \u201cIn my judgment, it is truly difficult to think of a sexual deviant who poses a greater risk than this defendant. There has not been a case such as the present where the defendant has used social media on an industrial scale to inflict such terrible and catastrophic damage on young girls, up to and including the death of a 12-year-old girl. </p> <p>\u201cThe defendant was remorseless. He ignored multiple opportunities to stop, he ignored multiple pleas for mercy. He lied and lied and then lied again.\u201d</p> <p>McCartney was sentenced to life in prison on the counts of manslaughter and of causing girls under 13 to engage in sexual activity including penetration.</p> <p>He was given a number of other sentences ranging from 10 years in each count for 45 counts of various degrees of seriousness that caused sexual activity in underage girls, six years in each count for 29 counts of possessing indecent images, and 10 years in each count for 58 counts of blackmail.</p> <p>Before handing down the sentence, the judge told families of the victims he would spare them repetition of the \u201csadism\u201d and the \u201charrowing nature\u201d of some of the details of McCartney\u2019s crimes.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a quite horrific case. Submissions were made on [McCartney\u2019s] behalf about various mitigating factors \u2026 Those mitigating factors are few in number and limited in nature,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.</p> <p>Sentencing was scheduled at the unusual time of 2pm to allow victims\u2019 families in the US and elsewhere to attend the hearing virtually.</p> <p>O\u2019Hara said the impact of McCartney\u2019s \u201cdepravity\u201d on his victims included \u201cdepression, anxiety, stress, shame, embarrassment, loss of confidence, difficulty in trusting others\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cFor many of them, their childhoods have been stolen. Some have attempted to commit suicide. Others report self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Whatever remorse the defendant now seeks to persuade me of, he was absolutely empty of remorse at the time.\u201d</p> <p>One of the victims, 12-year-old Cimarron Thomas, from West Virginia in the US, killed herself in May 2018 after McCartney threatened to share intimate images with her father.</p> <p>After retrieving electronic devices from McCartney\u2019s home, investigators discovered three years later that the girl died by suicide three minutes after the blackmail conversation.</p> <p>The court heard that Cimarron had become deeply distressed and told McCartney she would go to the police and take her own life. But he said he did not care and gave her a countdown for when he would share the pictures.</p> <p>Her body was found by her nine-year-old sister, and 18 months later her father, Ben Thomas, a US army veteran, also died by suicide, never knowing what had led his daughter to take her own life.</p> <p>In an impact statement, her grandparents said: \u201cOur lives will never be the same. We didn\u2019t get to see her graduate, walk down the aisle or have children. We have been robbed of those memories. Our lives have changed for ever.\u201d</p> <p>In another exchange, McCartney told a girl he would send people to her home to rape her if she did not comply with his sextortion demands.</p> <p>O\u2019Hara told of McCartney\u2019s callous and cold response to several victims who told him they would kill themselves or harm themselves.

      "bodyText": "A man from Northern Ireland who abused at least 70 children online and drove one to suicide has been sentenced to life in jail with a minimum term of 20 years in a \u201chorrific\u201d case that a judge said had caused \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d to young girls all over the world. Alexander McCartney, 26, admitted 185 charges including manslaughter, blackmail, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and producing and distributing indecent images of children. He was told he would spend at least 20 years in jail after a number of sentences that he will serve concurrently were taken into account. In one of the biggest investigations into \u201ccatfishing\u201d, or sexual extortion, in the world, police found victims aged between 10 and 16 in the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Prosecutors said McCartney had targeted about 3,500 children. He posed as a young girl to befriend other girls on Snapchat before blackmailing them, and is believed to be the UK\u2019s worst catfishing offender. Sitting at Belfast crown court, the judge, Justice O\u2019Hara, said: \u201cIn my judgment, it is truly difficult to think of a sexual deviant who poses a greater risk than this defendant. There has not been a case such as the present where the defendant has used social media on an industrial scale to inflict such terrible and catastrophic damage on young girls, up to and including the death of a 12-year-old girl. \u201cThe defendant was remorseless. He ignored multiple opportunities to stop, he ignored multiple pleas for mercy. He lied and lied and then lied again.\u201d McCartney was sentenced to life in prison on the counts of manslaughter and of causing girls under 13 to engage in sexual activity including penetration. He was given a number of other sentences ranging from 10 years in each count for 45 counts of various degrees of seriousness that caused sexual activity in underage girls, six years in each count for 29 counts of possessing indecent images, and 10 years in each count for 58 counts of blackmail. Before handing down the sentence, the judge told families of the victims he would spare them repetition of the \u201csadism\u201d and the \u201charrowing nature\u201d of some of the details of McCartney\u2019s crimes. \u201cThis is a quite horrific case. Submissions were made on [McCartney\u2019s] behalf about various mitigating factors \u2026 Those mitigating factors are few in number and limited in nature,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. Sentencing was scheduled at the unusual time of 2pm to allow victims\u2019 families in the US and elsewhere to attend the hearing virtually. O\u2019Hara said the impact of McCartney\u2019s \u201cdepravity\u201d on his victims included \u201cdepression, anxiety, stress, shame, embarrassment, loss of confidence, difficulty in trusting others\u201d. He said: \u201cFor many of them, their childhoods have been stolen. Some have attempted to commit suicide. Others report self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Whatever remorse the defendant now seeks to persuade me of, he was absolutely empty of remorse at the time.\u201d One of the victims, 12-year-old Cimarron Thomas, from West Virginia in the US, killed herself in May 2018 after McCartney threatened to share intimate images with her father. After retrieving electronic devices from McCartney\u2019s home, investigators discovered three years later that the girl died by suicide three minutes after the blackmail conversation. The court heard that Cimarron had become deeply distressed and told McCartney she would go to the police and take her own life. But he said he did not care and gave her a countdown for when he would share the pictures. Her body was found by her nine-year-old sister, and 18 months later her father, Ben Thomas, a US army veteran, also died by suicide, never knowing what had led his daughter to take her own life. In an impact statement, her grandparents said: \u201cOur lives will never be the same. We didn\u2019t get to see her graduate, walk down the aisle or have children. We have been robbed of those memories. Our lives have changed for ever.\u201d In another exchange, McCartney told a girl he would send people to her home to rape her if she did not comply with his sextortion demands. O\u2019Hara told of McCartney\u2019s callous and cold response to several victims who told him they would kill themselves or harm themselves. To one, he said: \u201cGood luck and goodbye.\u201d To another who had said her mother had cancer, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d As time went on \u201cthere was an escalation in the seriousness\u201d and \u201cdepravity\u201d of his conduct, O\u2019Hara said. Operating out of his bedroom in his family home outside Newry, the computer science student posed as a young girl on Snapchat, befriending girls who were gay or exploring their sexuality. The judge told the court: \u201cHis choice of victim was particularly calculating and sinister because the fact that they were exploring homosexuality added an additional layer of security to his actions.\u201d Once McCartney had secured a picture from his victims, he would then reveal the \u201ccatfish\u201d and blackmail them into taking part in sex acts. In some instances, he demanded his victims involve younger siblings, including victims of between three and five years old, O\u2019Hara told the court. McCartney was arrested several times between 2016 and 2019 but continued to offend despite bail conditions until he was remanded into custody. At a pre-sentence hearing last week, a prosecuting barrister said McCartney had degraded and humiliated his victims and that the harm caused to them was \u201cunquantifiable\u201d. When McCartney first came to the police\u2019s attention in 2016, they found eight computer towers, four laptops, eight tablets and nine mobile phones. Indecent images of children were found on four other devices. Catherine Kierans, the acting head of the serious crime unit at the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland, said the case was \u201cone of the most distressing and prolific cases of child sexual abuse\u201d they had ever seen. She said McCartney had targeted 3,500 children, many of whom had sought help on social media. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

I removed the weeds; I exterminated the harmful, invasive species.\u201d</p> <p>The document goes on to talk about \u201cthe evil enemies of nature and of England\u201d whom Parslow identifies as \u201cthe Jews, the Marxists and the globalists\u201d.</p>    <p>Storey said the full text \u201cbears all the hallmarks of being an extreme rightwing terrorist manifesto\u201d.</p> <p>Police found that before the attack Parslow had researched hotels being used to house asylum seekers. The defendant told jurors he went to the hotel to stab \u201cone of the Channel migrants\u201d because he was \u201cangry and frustrated\u201d at small boat crossings.</p> <p>The Pear Tree Inn was used by the government as a hotel for asylum seekers between November 2022 and February 2024 \u2013 at the time of the attack, it was closed to the public and undergoing renovations.</p> <p>Hagos had stayed at the hotel before moving elsewhere, but in April he had travelled back to visit its manager, who he had become friendly with during his time there. Parslow stabbed Hagos twice in the chest and chased him outside to the car park where he continued to brandish the knife.

      "bodyText": "A Nazi-obsessed extremist who stabbed an asylum seeker in the chest and said he was \u201cexterminating the invasive species\u201d in a \u201cterrorist manifesto\u201d has been found guilty of attempted murder. Callum Parslow, who has Adolf Hitler\u2019s signature tattooed on his left arm, repeatedly stabbed Nahom Hagos, 25, in the attack at a hotel previously used to house asylum seekers in Worcestershire. In a post he tried to publish on X after the attack, Parslow said he had \u201cdone his duty to England\u201d and had \u201cexterminated the harmful, invasive species\u201d. He tried to tag Tommy Robinson in the post, as well as prominent politicians such as Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, Nigel Farage and Suella Braverman. After a three-week trial at Leicester crown court, which could not be reported until a court order was lifted on Friday, Parslow, 32, was found guilty of attempted murder, after previously admitting a charge of wounding. CCTV footage showed that on 2 April this year, Parslow travelled from his home in Worcester to a nearby country hotel, The Pear Tree Inn, where he came across Hagos who was eating his lunch. He asked where Hagos was from, and when he replied that he was from Eritrea in east Africa, Parslow produced a knife and began to stab him, inflicting wounds to his chest and hand. The prosecutor Tom Storey KC said: \u201cThis was no random attack. The defendant\u2019s actions that day were carefully planned, and were driven by a particular ideology, specifically an extreme rightwing ideology, which had led him to identify and target his victim on the basis of his ethnicity.\u201d The message Parslow had tried to post on X read: \u201cI just did my duty to England \u2026 They will call me a terrorist, they will call me an extremist: I am neither. I am but a gardener tending to the great garden of England. I removed the weeds; I exterminated the harmful, invasive species.\u201d The document goes on to talk about \u201cthe evil enemies of nature and of England\u201d whom Parslow identifies as \u201cthe Jews, the Marxists and the globalists\u201d. Storey said the full text \u201cbears all the hallmarks of being an extreme rightwing terrorist manifesto\u201d. Police found that before the attack Parslow had researched hotels being used to house asylum seekers. The defendant told jurors he went to the hotel to stab \u201cone of the Channel migrants\u201d because he was \u201cangry and frustrated\u201d at small boat crossings. The Pear Tree Inn was used by the government as a hotel for asylum seekers between November 2022 and February 2024 \u2013 at the time of the attack, it was closed to the public and undergoing renovations. Hagos had stayed at the hotel before moving elsewhere, but in April he had travelled back to visit its manager, who he had become friendly with during his time there. Parslow stabbed Hagos twice in the chest and chased him outside to the car park where he continued to brandish the knife. Hagos then ran into the reception area of the hotel, where the manager locked the door. He was taken to hospital in a van by the hotel manager and a builder as they feared he was losing too much blood to wait for an ambulance. Hagos had a 8cm-long cut to his chest that penetrated the muscle and a wound to his hand that cut through all the tendons for four of his fingers. Parslow was later found by police walking along a canal with blood on his hands, and after a search of his house revealed items including a red swastika armband, he was arrested on suspicion of an act of terrorism. Analysis of Parslow\u2019s internet browser showed he had ordered a specialist knife from the US for $1,000 shortly before the attack, and searched \u201cwhere is the worst place to get stabbed on the torso?\u201d, \u201clife imprisonment in England and Wales\u201d, \u201cmurder\u201d, and \u201clying in wait\u201d. The court also heard that in January Parslow\u2019s tenancy was terminated by his landlord because of a racist note he left on a communal door. The attempted murder trial could be reported only after a restriction was lifted when Parslow pleaded guilty to an unconnected sexual offence and two charges under the Malicious Communications Act. He will be sentenced at a later date.",

      "bodyText": "When Brisbane mother Amy-Clare learned she was pregnant a second time, she almost opted not to undertake prenatal genetic testing. \u201cWe were really happy \u2013 we really wanted that baby,\u201d she recalls. Because she already had a healthy first child, Amy-Clare was inclined to believe things would go smoothly the second time. But for peace of mind, her partner talked her into getting the expensive test, which screens for chromosomal disorders early in pregnancy. The test, in January 2021, showed that the foetus had an extra copy of chromosome 18. It was a serious genetic condition. Most babies affected die prenatally, or not long after birth. Hopes that there had been a testing error were dashed when Amy-Clare had an ultrasound late in her first trimester. The specialist performing the scan narrated to the couple what she saw: the baby\u2019s stomach was outside the body, she couldn\u2019t find evidence of any kidneys, the head was enlarged. The baby would be unlikely to make it to birth, they were told. Amy-Clare and her partner were left alone in the room, processing the news. \u201cWe knew, even from that moment,\u201d she says. \u201cWalking around pregnant [for months longer], knowing you\u2019re expecting a miscarriage at any point, would have been traumatic. I wasn\u2019t going to put myself through that; I wasn\u2019t going to put my body through that.\u201d Unable to access a termination of pregnancy at her local public hospital, Amy-Clare had an abortion at a private clinic. \u201cI remember the doctor who performed the abortion holding my hand and saying: there\u2019ll be another baby.\u201d Amy-Clare says it would be \u201can absolute nightmare\u201d if abortion were to be recriminalised in Queensland. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine someone who had to go through what I had to go through doing that and feeling like a criminal as well,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though my abortion felt like the only choice for medical reasons \u2026 anyone who has a pregnancy they don\u2019t want should be able to terminate that pregnancy and to do so safely.\u201d When the bill that would legalise abortion came before the Queensland parliament in 2018, all but three Liberal National party MPs voted against it. David Crisafulli, who is now the party\u2019s leader, and his current deputy, Jarrod Bleijie, were among those opposed to legalisation. At a live event last year, Crisafulli said he did not \u201cbelieve in late-term abortions\u201d, Guardian Australia revealed on Tuesday. Throughout the Queensland election campaign, the opposition leader has repeatedly refused to rule out a conscience vote on the issue if elected, despite giving a \u201cpersonal guarantee\u201d that abortion laws would not change. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email On Monday, leading health organisations including the professional bodies for GPs (RACGP) and obstetricians and gynaecologists (RANZCOG) released a joint statement saying a recriminalisation of abortion in Queensland \u201cwould be a harmful step backwards, risking the health and safety of pregnant people and undoing years of progress.\u201d When Brisbane psychologist Lara was pregnant with her first baby, a girl, she was devastated to learn during her 20-week scan that brain abnormalities had been identified. An MRI a few days later showed that the foetus had agenesis of the corpus callosum, a rare birth defect in which the band of nerve fibres connecting the left and right hemispheres of the brain does not form properly. In isolation, the condition can cause impairments ranging from mild to severe. But doctors weren\u2019t able to rule out other disorders such as Aicardi syndrome, which causes recurrent seizures. Lara found herself desperate not to be pregnant. But it was 2017, when abortion was still illegal in Queensland, and to access a termination of pregnancy through the public system she was told she would have to declare before a panel of doctors that she was at risk of killing herself. At the time, women who had \u201cunlawful\u201d abortions faced up to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. Abortion providers could be penalised with up to 14 years, with exemptions from criminal liability \u201cto preserve the mother\u2019s life\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I was willing to say that I was suicidal at a point when I wasn\u2019t, even though, in hindsight, I was extremely distressed,\u201d Lara recalls. She looked into the possibility of travelling interstate, but decided against it because it would probably delay the termination she sought. \u201cAt the time, I was visibly pregnant, and being in public was like torture for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe experience of being pregnant when you no longer want to be pregnant is just excruciating.\u201d Lara eventually found a private obstetrician who performed an induced labour termination, treating her with compassion and not without professional risk. \u201cThat was just pure luck that I was able to find someone \u2026 and my own privilege, being a healthcare worker.\u201d Lara has since had two children. \u201cI was so scared to have another baby and to [potentially] go through it again,\u201d she says.

While the film has plenty of old footage of Farnham \u2013 as a little boy, as a teenage heart-throb, as an older star belting out hits on stage \u2013 the singer didn\u2019t want anything to do with it. His brief, quiet narration in the film was recorded not by Stockell, but by Gaynor Martin, wife of Farnham\u2019s longtime manager and friend Glenn Wheatley, who had gently pushed Farnham to allow the film to be made. But as Stockell spoke to more members of Farnham\u2019s inner circle \u2013 the Wheatleys, then his sons Rob and James, then his wife, Jillian \u2013 it was fed back to Farnham that Stockell was, in her words, \u201calright\u201d.</p> <p>Months later, Stockell got a surprising call. Her famously private subject now wanted to write a memoir, and he wanted her to write it with him. Having already spent years poring over his life, she finally found the Voice in his home in Victoria, sitting in an armchair and ready to spill.</p> <p>But even though Farnham was finally willing to talk, it was harder for him than ever. In late 2022, he was diagnosed with mouth cancer and underwent surgery that involved removing all his bottom teeth and scraping his jaw bone. \u201cI was told later that someone from the medical team called Jillian a couple of times while I was in \u00adtheatre \u2013 apparently I was very close to dying,\u201d he writes in the memoir. Then, while recovering from surgery, he broke his back and had to return to hospital. A subsequent course of radiotherapy left him uninterested in food and his weight dropped to 63kg.</p>    <p>When Stockell and Farnham finally sat across from one another for the first time, he\u2019d truly been in the wars <strong>\u2013</strong> but she found he was determined to crack on. \u201cSometimes he would have a giggle and then wince because he\u2019d stretched his mouth and the scarring made it hard. But he\u2019d want to keep going,\u201d Stockell says. \u201cHe\u2019s a workhorse. I always think of him as a bit of a boxer. He will go and go. And he was often really perky. He can be silly, he\u2019s really fun.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The cancer diagnosis \u201cgutted\u201d him, Farnham writes in the memoir. Being unable to open his mouth means he may never sing again: \u201cMy facial disfigurement from the surgery means I can\u2019t open my mouth wide enough for a strip of spaghetti, let alone to sing a top C. At this stage I can\u2019t get the movement to make the sounds I want to make, and that\u2019s where the vibrations and my voice come from. It\u2019s still a very disconcerting thing. And trying hurts.\u201d</p> <p>But the radiation treatment hasn\u2019t yet damaged his vocal cords, which leaves him hopeful. He\u2019s still having a go: \u201cI can barely open my mouth but I still wail in the shower.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/18/how-john-farnham-youre-the-voice-became-australia-anthem\">Make a noise and make it clear!

He had watched her documentary \u201cthrough his fingers\u201d, she laughs. \u201cIn some ways, I feel like I know his life better than he does now,\u201d she jokes. \u201cHe really liked it, because he thought that I got him. There\u2019s no way I would have been a part of the book if I hadn\u2019t made the film.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s some complex emotions there \u2013 shame, guilt. So it wasn\u2019t easy, but I think it was ultimately cathartic</p> <footer> <cite>Poppy Stockell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During their fourth session, she recalls, Farnham \u201clooked me straight in the eyes and said, \u2018OK, I trust you\u2019.\u201d . Many times, while covering particularly traumatic memories, they were both in tears: \u201cWe both cried heaps, but we laughed a lot too,\u201d Stockell says. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of being vulnerable, which I really admire, and I think that\u2019s a similarity between us.\u201d</p> <p>The memoir charts the heights of his celebrity, with some fabulous anecdotes: Bob Hawke crying with him at his Australian citizenship ceremony; Diana, Princess of Wales telling him that she likes his leather pants; or US actor Raquel Welch propositioning him at the 1989 Logies \u2013 in front of Jill. \u201cSorry, my wife said no,\u201d he told her, which made Welch \u201claugh her arse off\u201d.</p>    <p>But there is also a lot of pain and hardship. There were the years after his twee hit Sadie the Cleaning Lady, when he was still seen as Johnny Farnham (or a \u201cpretty-boy puppet\u201d as he puts it); the lack of work meant, by the 1970s, he had to open tabs at the local shops to buy groceries for his family. Then there was his unhappy spell as frontman of Little River Band, struggling against \u201cundercurrents of animosity, jealousy and petty peeves\u201d. And then the dark, fallow period before Whispering Jack became the highest-selling album in Australia, when he fell into depression, believing he\u2019d never make it.</p> <p>But the most difficult part was revisting his entry into the music industry as an innocent teenager. \u201cIt is a very predatory industry\u201d says Stockell. \u201cJohn would turn up after some sessions and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sleep at all.\u2019 He\u2019d have pretty bad nightmares after we spoke about certain things. Several times he\u2019d rush through periods, and I\u2019d have to gently take him back, without torturing him. It\u2019s tricky \u2013 [as a memoirist] you\u2019re wearing a few hats and probably some you\u2019re not really qualified to wear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy talking about myself, I really don\u2019t,\u201d the memoir opens \u2013 but Stockell thinks he did by the end. \u201cHe\u2019d grumble about having to talk about himself, as he\u2019s not that kind of a guy, but I think he did [enjoy it]. It was also hard going over a lot of what\u2019s been. There\u2019s some complex emotions there \u2013 shame, guilt. So it wasn\u2019t easy, but I think it was ultimately cathartic.\u201d</p>    <p>Of all of Australia\u2019s most beloved songwriters \u2013 Jimmy Barnes, Peter Garrett, Paul Kelly \u2013 Farnham is the last to write a memoir, and has held his cards close to his chest for a long time. \u201cHe\u2019s very private,\u201d Stockell says. \u201cBut I also think, for so long we thought of him as a dag, so this cracking story has just been sitting in front of us and hasn\u2019t been really told before. I was like, \u2018Oh my God. How did this come to me? Twice?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And what does Farnham think of the memoir? \u201cHe went, \u2018You spelled my brother\u2019s name wrong!\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m just giving him time. He\u2019s probably biting his fingernails, worried about how it\u2019s all going to be received. Actually, I know he is. But I also know that that comes from a lifetime of being exposed.

His brief, quiet narration in the film was recorded not by Stockell, but by Gaynor Martin, wife of Farnham\u2019s longtime manager and friend Glenn Wheatley, who had gently pushed Farnham to allow the film to be made. But as Stockell spoke to more members of Farnham\u2019s inner circle \u2013 the Wheatleys, then his sons Rob and James, then his wife, Jillian \u2013 it was fed back to Farnham that Stockell was, in her words, \u201calright\u201d. Months later, Stockell got a surprising call. Her famously private subject now wanted to write a memoir, and he wanted her to write it with him. Having already spent years poring over his life, she finally found the Voice in his home in Victoria, sitting in an armchair and ready to spill. But even though Farnham was finally willing to talk, it was harder for him than ever. In late 2022, he was diagnosed with mouth cancer and underwent surgery that involved removing all his bottom teeth and scraping his jaw bone. \u201cI was told later that someone from the medical team called Jillian a couple of times while I was in theatre \u2013 apparently I was very close to dying,\u201d he writes in the memoir. Then, while recovering from surgery, he broke his back and had to return to hospital. A subsequent course of radiotherapy left him uninterested in food and his weight dropped to 63kg. When Stockell and Farnham finally sat across from one another for the first time, he\u2019d truly been in the wars \u2013 but she found he was determined to crack on. \u201cSometimes he would have a giggle and then wince because he\u2019d stretched his mouth and the scarring made it hard. But he\u2019d want to keep going,\u201d Stockell says. \u201cHe\u2019s a workhorse. I always think of him as a bit of a boxer. He will go and go. And he was often really perky. He can be silly, he\u2019s really fun.\u201d Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The cancer diagnosis \u201cgutted\u201d him, Farnham writes in the memoir. Being unable to open his mouth means he may never sing again: \u201cMy facial disfigurement from the surgery means I can\u2019t open my mouth wide enough for a strip of spaghetti, let alone to sing a top C. At this stage I can\u2019t get the movement to make the sounds I want to make, and that\u2019s where the vibrations and my voice come from. It\u2019s still a very disconcerting thing. And trying hurts.\u201d But the radiation treatment hasn\u2019t yet damaged his vocal cords, which leaves him hopeful. He\u2019s still having a go: \u201cI can barely open my mouth but I still wail in the shower.\u201d Farnham spoke to Stockell in marathon sessions over several months; she estimates 50 hours in total. He had watched her documentary \u201cthrough his fingers\u201d, she laughs. \u201cIn some ways, I feel like I know his life better than he does now,\u201d she jokes. \u201cHe really liked it, because he thought that I got him. There\u2019s no way I would have been a part of the book if I hadn\u2019t made the film.\u201d During their fourth session, she recalls, Farnham \u201clooked me straight in the eyes and said, \u2018OK, I trust you\u2019.\u201d . Many times, while covering particularly traumatic memories, they were both in tears: \u201cWe both cried heaps, but we laughed a lot too,\u201d Stockell says. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of being vulnerable, which I really admire, and I think that\u2019s a similarity between us.\u201d The memoir charts the heights of his celebrity, with some fabulous anecdotes: Bob Hawke crying with him at his Australian citizenship ceremony; Diana, Princess of Wales telling him that she likes his leather pants; or US actor Raquel Welch propositioning him at the 1989 Logies \u2013 in front of Jill. \u201cSorry, my wife said no,\u201d he told her, which made Welch \u201claugh her arse off\u201d. But there is also a lot of pain and hardship. There were the years after his twee hit Sadie the Cleaning Lady, when he was still seen as Johnny Farnham (or a \u201cpretty-boy puppet\u201d as he puts it); the lack of work meant, by the 1970s, he had to open tabs at the local shops to buy groceries for his family. Then there was his unhappy spell as frontman of Little River Band, struggling against \u201cundercurrents of animosity, jealousy and petty peeves\u201d. And then the dark, fallow period before Whispering Jack became the highest-selling album in Australia, when he fell into depression, believing he\u2019d never make it. But the most difficult part was revisting his entry into the music industry as an innocent teenager. \u201cIt is a very predatory industry\u201d says Stockell. \u201cJohn would turn up after some sessions and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sleep at all.\u2019 He\u2019d have pretty bad nightmares after we spoke about certain things. Several times he\u2019d rush through periods, and I\u2019d have to gently take him back, without torturing him. It\u2019s tricky \u2013 [as a memoirist] you\u2019re wearing a few hats and probably some you\u2019re not really qualified to wear.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy talking about myself, I really don\u2019t,\u201d the memoir opens \u2013 but Stockell thinks he did by the end. \u201cHe\u2019d grumble about having to talk about himself, as he\u2019s not that kind of a guy, but I think he did [enjoy it]. It was also hard going over a lot of what\u2019s been. There\u2019s some complex emotions there \u2013 shame, guilt. So it wasn\u2019t easy, but I think it was ultimately cathartic.\u201d Of all of Australia\u2019s most beloved songwriters \u2013 Jimmy Barnes, Peter Garrett, Paul Kelly \u2013 Farnham is the last to write a memoir, and has held his cards close to his chest for a long time. \u201cHe\u2019s very private,\u201d Stockell says. \u201cBut I also think, for so long we thought of him as a dag, so this cracking story has just been sitting in front of us and hasn\u2019t been really told before. I was like, \u2018Oh my God. How did this come to me? Twice?\u2019\u201d And what does Farnham think of the memoir? \u201cHe went, \u2018You spelled my brother\u2019s name wrong!\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m just giving him time. He\u2019s probably biting his fingernails, worried about how it\u2019s all going to be received. Actually, I know he is. But I also know that that comes from a lifetime of being exposed. You really don\u2019t want to be famous.\u201d The Voice Inside by John Farnham and Poppy Stockell is out on Wednesday (Hachette, $49.99)",

He walked on to the stage there and thought, \u201cI wish I could be in this play\u201d, and was promptly cast in his first role, as <a href=\"https://newtheatrehistory.org.au/wiki/index.php/Person_-_Simon_Burke\">Roboy</a>, a boy robot.</p>    <p>After more amateur productions, Burke was cast at 12 in his first professional play, <a href=\"https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/6032\">Kookaburra</a>, at the Nimrod theatre in Surry Hills, in 1974, directed by Richard Wherrett, and then at 13 by Fred Schepisi in the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/27/the-devils-playground-rewatched-confronting-take-on-catholic-repression\">The Devil\u2019s Playground</a>, shot in Werribee, south-west of Melbourne, in 1975, a role for which Burke became famous.

Burke is glad to be home, in nearby Surry Hills, after touring for four years \u2013 most recently, he has put in 800 performances in Moulin Rouge! The Musical and more than 200 in Wicked. When we meet he is preparing for the upcoming Sydney premiere of two-part play, <a href=\"https://www.seymourcentre.com/event/the-inheritance/\">The Inheritance</a>, in which Burke will perform the characters of Morgan and Walter, who suffered incalculable loss during the Aids crisis. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not saying that I lost all my friends \u2026 but I didn\u2019t realise how much I\u2019d blocked it out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Burke and I turn up towards the frock shop on Oxford Street that once housed a newsagent. For three years beginning at age eight, Burke and his mate Steven \u201cFitzy\u201d Fitzpatrick would drag a huge, yellow metal barrow here up these steep streets, to be filled with some 200 afternoon newspapers to sell at the local hospital and to the soldiers behind the sandstone walls of Victoria Barracks.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d he says, as we climb steep Ormond Street. \u201cThis will show you how little a hill means to an eight- or nine-year-old.\u201d</p> <p>As we walk past a chic boutique \u2013 which was once \u201cdisgusting corner shop\u201d \u2013 Burke is taken back to his time growing up in the area. He remembers his mother, a stenographer, and later a judge\u2019s personal assistant. She would write to Burke a letter at age 13 when he was in the middle of filming The Devil\u2019s Playground to tell him she and their father had separated.</p>    <p>It fell to Schepisi\u2019s late second wife, Rhonda, to break the news on set, and comfort him as he cried. Burke had \u201cslotted into\u201d Fred and Rhonda\u2019s family unit, living with them during the eight-week shoot. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget, Mum had spoken to them and written a letter to me. Rhonda gave me the letter and was there, waiting for me to \u2026 \u201d He trails off. Did he compartmentalise the loss and carry on filming? \u201cI think I did. I had a big cry with her.\u201d</p> <p>Burke\u2019s policeman father was then stationed near Sydney\u2019s gay golden mile, Oxford Street, during an infamous period of police violence against the LGBTI+ community. \u201cI shudder to think he might have been there [on duty] among the 78ers.\u201d In June 1978, the first Sydney Gay Mardi Gras, as it was then called, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/04/police-apologise-to-original-sydney-mardi-gras-marchers-of-1978\">ended in the arrests </a>of 53 marchers at Kings Cross, with police beating some arrestees in the Darlinghurst cells. Burke wonders if his dad might have participated in the violence.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he would have shied away from any of the stuff that went on, to be quite honest.\u201d </p> <p>Burke then brightens, remembering the best attributes of the father taken by cancer at age 63. \u201cI spent a lot of my 20s, 30s and 40s not realising what I got from him, which was his sense of humour, and my work ethic has a lot to do with him. It\u2019s been an interesting journey, coming to that.\u201d</p>    <p>Burke knew nothing about that first Mardi Gras, when he was 16, and the march would not be on his radar for a few years. He came to terms with being gay early \u2013 but only \u201cto a certain degree\u201d. \u201cI was in the theatre and felt very comfortable with colleagues and friends and acquaintances, but even a millimetre out of that circle, I was extremely uncomfortable about being gay, and I was terrified that, particularly as a young, potentially leading man at that time about [losing roles].</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain it\u2019s been an impediment with certain, particular people in particular jobs. I still think that\u2019s the case, actually. That sucks. But I\u2019m also grateful every day for having my long career, that I get to do mostly the stuff I want to do.\u201d </p> <p>Burke has taken on queer stage roles in the past, but rehearsing Walter\u2019s monologue in The Inheritance, in which the character talks about one person after another dying, has taken Burke back to a period when he lost many of his own friends to Aids, including those who were \u201cextremely close\u201d.</p>    <p>\u201cThe first time I did it in front of the [fellow younger cast members] it was like PTSD, almost,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the guys said to me afterwards, \u2018It must have been like being a soldier in the world war two.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying that I lost all my friends; no more than anyone else my age in my community, but I didn\u2019t realise how much I\u2019d blocked it out until I started working on this play.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/10/cost-of-living-sydney-theatre-company-philip-quast-interview\">Philip Quast: \u2018I don\u2019t have anything left to say in theatre, it\u2019s not my turn any more\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just like the fictional character he plays, Burke himself landed at age 20 in New York\u2019s Times Square in 1981, just prior to the HIV outbreak.

      "bodyText": "On a windy Monday afternoon, actor and singer Simon Burke stands outside the home where his family lived for his first 13 years of life, a two-storey cream Victorian terrace in inner-Sydney\u2019s once raffish Paddington. Fifty years on, the wooden front door is unchanged. At four, little Simon would sit on a letterbox here, pretending to play piano on this spiked wrought-iron fence. We gaze up at the jacaranda on the street, its purple spring flowers blooming above the power lines. \u201cThis was literally planted by my mum when I was born,\u201d says Burke, 63. Since then Burke has played on stages from the Sydney Opera House to London\u2019s West End, on screens big and small. \u201cLook how old it is now! Old and gnarled and still puts on a good show, just like me.\u201d Good memories? \u201cMixed,\u201d he says, demeanour turning quietly reflective as he stares into the middle distance. \u201cIt\u2019s the house I grew up in, it\u2019s the house my parents broke up in.\u201d His parents had been increasingly unhappy as Burke reached adolescence. \u201cThings were pretty rough in my family life,\u201d he says. It will later become clear as we talk that Burke felt distant from the world view of his father, a \u201ctough cookie\u201d cop at the local Darlinghurst police station. Opportunity knocked here in 1971, when Burke, then aged nine, was asked by his next-door neighbour to carry some costumes she had designed for an amateur production of a children\u2019s play, The Magic Travel Box. He walked on to the stage there and thought, \u201cI wish I could be in this play\u201d, and was promptly cast in his first role, as Roboy, a boy robot. After more amateur productions, Burke was cast at 12 in his first professional play, Kookaburra, at the Nimrod theatre in Surry Hills, in 1974, directed by Richard Wherrett, and then at 13 by Fred Schepisi in the film The Devil\u2019s Playground, shot in Werribee, south-west of Melbourne, in 1975, a role for which Burke became famous. Wherrett and Schepisi meanwhile became father figures. \u201cAll three of those experiences, I felt like I was saved,\u201d Burke reflects now. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the happiest kid, but then becoming an important cog in the wheel of that film, there were these adults who were amazing role models.\u201d We are about to set off walking the newspaper sales and delivery route Burke used to do around here as a kid with his best mate from Darlinghurst public school. Burke is glad to be home, in nearby Surry Hills, after touring for four years \u2013 most recently, he has put in 800 performances in Moulin Rouge! The Musical and more than 200 in Wicked. When we meet he is preparing for the upcoming Sydney premiere of two-part play, The Inheritance, in which Burke will perform the characters of Morgan and Walter, who suffered incalculable loss during the Aids crisis. Burke and I turn up towards the frock shop on Oxford Street that once housed a newsagent. For three years beginning at age eight, Burke and his mate Steven \u201cFitzy\u201d Fitzpatrick would drag a huge, yellow metal barrow here up these steep streets, to be filled with some 200 afternoon newspapers to sell at the local hospital and to the soldiers behind the sandstone walls of Victoria Barracks. \u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d he says, as we climb steep Ormond Street. \u201cThis will show you how little a hill means to an eight- or nine-year-old.\u201d As we walk past a chic boutique \u2013 which was once \u201cdisgusting corner shop\u201d \u2013 Burke is taken back to his time growing up in the area. He remembers his mother, a stenographer, and later a judge\u2019s personal assistant.

At least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and 97,166 have been wounded in Gaza, according to the territory\u2019s health ministry (though unofficial estimates are more than triple that), since Israel launched its bombardment on the strip following Hamas\u2019s 7 October 2023 attacks that killed about 1,200 Israelis.

All five monitored freshwater sites, which include Wentworth Falls Lake beach in the Blue Mountains and Arthur Keough Reserve on the mid-north coast, were rated \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cvery poor\u201d. The report was prepared off the results of 20 audits of field samples collected and analysed throughout the year by scientists working for the government\u2019s Beachwatch program in partnership with Sydney Water and Hunter Water. While the report said the results were good overall, it noted water quality had declined slightly from the previous year. It attributed this to wet months in many coastal areas including above average rainfall in April and other \u201csignificant rainfall events\u201d, although rainfall totals were average or below average in winter and early spring last year. Rainfall is the major driver of pollution in recreational swimming sites because it generates stormwater runoff and \u201cuntreated discharges\u201d from the wastewater treatment and transport systems, the report said. The report warned that contamination with faecal material from animals or humans could pose \u201csignificant health problems\u201d including gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infection because it meant bacteria and other pathogens could be in the water. The NSW environment minister, Penny Sharpe, said the state\u2019s beaches almost always had good or very good water quality, but she encouraged people to check the Beachwatch website for live updates after any rain. \u201cI\u2019m excited that this summer, a range of popular inland swimming spots including the hugely popular Penrith beach will be added\u201d she said.

Last year was the second warmest on record since 1884, with only 2022 warmer.</p> <p>\u201cIf you believe, as I do, that climate change is the most fundamental challenge facing humanity,\u201d says Sunil Amrith, history professor at Yale\u2019s School of Environment, and author of the forthcoming book <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/319429/the-burning-earth-by-amrith-sunil/9780241461983\">The Burning Earth: An Environmental History of the Past 500 Years</a>, \u201cany contribution to making its causes and effects more widely known will have a role to play\u201d.</p> <p>Extremely wet days occurred 20% more frequently in 2014-23 than from 1961-90. Disturbing too was data from the tide gauge at Newlyn in Cornwall showing the sea level was higher in 2023 than any year since 1916.</p>    <p> Met Office forecaster and presenter Alex Burkill does not agree that climate denialism is rife among meteorologists. \u201cI think the reason we don\u2019t do it very often is twofold. One is timings. We don\u2019t always have a huge amount of time to talk, particularly on TV. If there\u2019s important weather to be discussing, you don\u2019t really want to waste time talking about climate change. You\u2019d much rather get the information the public need to make sure they stay safe.\u201d</p> <p>Burkill says that for analyses of what causes extreme weather, you\u2019d do better to consult the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@metoffice\">Met Office\u2019s YouTube channel </a>or its app. \u201cThat\u2019s where we do our deep dives, our 10-day trends. In those deep dives we will, if necessary, put it down to climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Charlton-Perez, professor of meteorology at Reading University, several of whose students have gone on to be weather forecasters, says it\u2019s hard to strike the right balance. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a Trojan horse. If you possibly can, you squeeze in some meteorology to explain something, but actually what most people want to know is, is it going to be hot?\u201d</p> <p>The second reason Burkill cites is more surprising. It is hard, he says, to demonstrate with scientific rigour that looming extreme weather definitely is caused by the climate crisis. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had high temperatures, we\u2019ve always had low temperatures, we\u2019ve always had heavy rain, we\u2019ve always had strong winds,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously, a changing climate is making extreme high temperatures and rain more common and they\u2019re likely to be down to climate change, but it\u2019s hard to show that.\u201d</p>    <p>Charlton-Perez agrees. \u201cYou can\u2019t in good scientific judgment say these events were due to climate change all the time. It requires quite a complicated chain of arguments and marshalling of data to make the case.\u201d</p> <p>This is precisely what the growing field of climate attribution studies does \u2013 using statistical analyses to attribute local extremes to the climate crisis. Amrith says such analyses were used by the Singaporean government investigation into the turbulence that hit flight SQ321 in May, resulting in the death of one passenger and more than 30 people injured. The official report <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/environment/explained-singapore-airlines-turbulence-how-is-climate-change-affecting-flights-3033806\">attributed the turbulence to the climate emergency</a>. But Burkill says it is a tricky business for forecasters to use such calculations on TV weather bulletins. \u201cThe normal process is to do a study post the event to assess whether climate change has played a role.\u201d</p> <p>One exception to this happened in July 2022, when the UK saw temperatures exceed 40C for the first time. An earlier Met Office study had concluded that the 40 threshold would probably be breached only because of the climate emergency.</p> <p>\u201cTemperatures of this value had never been experienced before and presented a risk to a public not used to these levels,\u201d says Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge. \u201cThe chances of exceeding temperatures of 40C in the UK would only be likely with climate change, so we were able to signal this in our forecasts ahead of the event.\u201d</p> <p>This was a discombobulating moment for British meteorology. \u201cWhen I became a meteorologist 10 years ago,\u201d says Burkill, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be as soon as 2022 when we were talking about temperatures getting to 40 Celsius in the UK. We thought it\u2019d be the next 50 years or so.\u201d</p> <p>And then there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/21/second-danger-to-life-warning-issued-as-storm-babet-continues-to-batter-uk\">Storm Babet</a> that laid waste to much of the east coast of Scotland last October. \u201cWhile we were reporting it, we would mention the fact that the changing climate would have made that event more likely,\u201d says Burkill. \u201cYou\u2019ve always got to have a caveat \u2013 that this could have happened without climate change. It\u2019s just more likely with it. So then whether or not it has its place in a very short bulletin is a vexed question.\u201d</p> <p>TV meteorology has clearly changed since the heady days when presenters appliqu\u00e9d maps with what looked like velcro-backed snow and rain symbols made by preschoolers. The hope must be that supercomputer modelling used now to create our bulletins makes booboos like the one Michael Fish made on 15 October 1987 less likely. \u201cEarlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnxjZ-aFkjs\">said Fish at the time</a>. \u201c Well, if you\u2019re watching, don\u2019t worry, there isn\u2019t!\u201d Sadly for Fish, and indeed for Britain, there was.</p> <p>Charlton-Perez defends the weather presenting legend. \u201cBut you know, Michael Fish was a meteorologist and forecasting the weather scientifically.\u201d Since the 1980s, though, Charlton-Perez points out forecasting has become more sophisticated. \u201cWe have moved from interpreting charts according to physical laws to having a computer solve the equations and make the forecast. We now do it so the weather forecaster is not looking at a single forecast \u2013 they\u2019re looking at maybe 50 or 100.\u201d</p> <p>But your nightly weather bulletin is poised to be revolutionised, like everything else in human culture, by artificial intelligence. Charlton-Perez points out that in the past two years Google, Microsoft, Nvidia and Huawei have been developing weather forecasts using AI technology. \u201cThey run thousands of times faster than normal weather forecasting models. I can run those on my laptop.\u201d</p>    <p>If AI is more accurate and less labour intensive, the ramifications for forecasters and weather presenters are alarming to contemplate. \u201cAll of the major forecasting centres are grappling with that,\u201d says Charlton-Perez. \u201cPeople are nervous about their jobs. And then the question becomes: do you trust Google to do your weather forecast?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps AI could not only more accurately forecast the weather but ChatGPT-engaged bots could present it, making, say, Carol Kirkwood and Stav Danaos redundant. \u201cFrom a presenter point of view, there\u2019s obviously the concern that we might get replaced with an AI robot,\u201d says Burkill. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen particularly soon, because I think people still want that human interaction.\u201d He has a more pressing worry \u2013 that his weather forecasts can be deepfaked. \u201cMore concerning is the ability for people to use AI to modify what we\u2019ve said. They can be quite convincing.\u201d </p> <p>In the meantime, the battle for meteorologists to get the message out about the climate crisis faces another obstacle: social media. \u201cIn the past, people might write in to complain, but now, within minutes, I could have someone popping off on my social media and disagreeing with me. We do get comments on our posts and forecasts and some are pretty horrible,\u201d says Burkill. Often they come from deniers furious at suggestions that humans might have had a role in making the world hotter, wetter and stormier. \u201cThey feel strongly about their misinformation.\u201d</p> <p>And nothing, be it human weather forecaster or artificial intelligence, is going to change that.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When the Democrat Sherrod Brown was first elected to the US Senate in 2006, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio\">Ohio</a>, with its large urban populations and manufacturing industries, was fairly reliable territory for Democrats.</p> <p>Barack Obama claimed the state in 2008 and 2012 on his way to the White House. Democrats boasted strong representation in Ohio\u2019s politics. Analysts zealously watched its voting patterns, such was its prominence as a bellwether state.</p> <p>In the years since, the state has become older, whiter and more conservative. Manufacturing has shrunk and population has stagnated.</p> <p>Brown is now the only Democrat holding a statewide seat in Ohio. And he is weeks out from a crucial Senate election against former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/bernie-moreno-ohio-senate-candidate\">luxury car dealer Bernie Moreno</a>, a contest that could reshape US politics for years to come,</p> <p>For one, keeping Brown\u2019s seat is crucial if Democrats hope to maintain their control of the US Senate.</p> <p>If Brown can win re-election, it would be notable in a state where Republicans have engineered a<a href=\"https://signalcleveland.org/ohio-gerrymandering-explained/\"> gerrymandering process</a> to their advantage. They hold a supermajority in the state\u2019s house of representatives and senate, and control the offices of the governor, secretary of state and attorney general as well as the state supreme court. Ohio\u2019s second US senator is none other than Trump\u2019s pick for vice-president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance\">JD Vance</a>.</p> <p>Brown is facing his most formidable on-comer yet \u2013 not because his Republican challenger has resonated particularly effectively with the Ohio electorate, but because Brown has, until now, never run in a year when Donald Trump was also on the ballot.</p> <p>For James Spencer, who has lived in Moraine, a working-class suburb of Dayton, for 27 years, the former president\u2019s endorsement of Moreno is enough to secure his vote.</p> <p>As a retired construction contractor, he was unhappy to see the nearby General Motors plant that once employed thousands of blue-collar workers taken over by a Chinese auto glass manufacturer, Fuyao Glass. He believes the perceived problems associated with the company, including a raid by the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies <a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/large-law-enforcement-presence-at-fuyao-glass-in-moraine/U2EW4RQEPFAHVNLBHZNOV3WRZQ/\">investigating allegations</a> of financial crimes and labor exploitation in July, have only worsened since.</p> <p>In the past, he said, \u201cEverything went around the plant.

      "bodyText": "When the Democrat Sherrod Brown was first elected to the US Senate in 2006, Ohio, with its large urban populations and manufacturing industries, was fairly reliable territory for Democrats. Barack Obama claimed the state in 2008 and 2012 on his way to the White House. Democrats boasted strong representation in Ohio\u2019s politics. Analysts zealously watched its voting patterns, such was its prominence as a bellwether state. In the years since, the state has become older, whiter and more conservative. Manufacturing has shrunk and population has stagnated. Brown is now the only Democrat holding a statewide seat in Ohio. And he is weeks out from a crucial Senate election against former luxury car dealer Bernie Moreno, a contest that could reshape US politics for years to come, For one, keeping Brown\u2019s seat is crucial if Democrats hope to maintain their control of the US Senate. If Brown can win re-election, it would be notable in a state where Republicans have engineered a gerrymandering process to their advantage. They hold a supermajority in the state\u2019s house of representatives and senate, and control the offices of the governor, secretary of state and attorney general as well as the state supreme court. Ohio\u2019s second US senator is none other than Trump\u2019s pick for vice-president, JD Vance. Brown is facing his most formidable on-comer yet \u2013 not because his Republican challenger has resonated particularly effectively with the Ohio electorate, but because Brown has, until now, never run in a year when Donald Trump was also on the ballot. For James Spencer, who has lived in Moraine, a working-class suburb of Dayton, for 27 years, the former president\u2019s endorsement of Moreno is enough to secure his vote. As a retired construction contractor, he was unhappy to see the nearby General Motors plant that once employed thousands of blue-collar workers taken over by a Chinese auto glass manufacturer, Fuyao Glass. He believes the perceived problems associated with the company, including a raid by the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies investigating allegations of financial crimes and labor exploitation in July, have only worsened since. In the past, he said, \u201cEverything went around the plant. Your friends, your family. It was like a big GM community \u2026 We\u2019ve lost so much in this area.\u201d The declining fortunes experienced by white working-class Ohioans such as Spencer have been seized on by Trump and Moreno. However, Brown, the incumbent, is hoping his longstanding position as a champion of workers\u2019 rights can carry him over the line. His campaign and supporters have largely disassociated Brown from the Biden administration and Kamala Harris campaign, despite the former helping to bring billions of dollars in infrastructure funding to rural parts of the state. \u201cBrown has crossover appeal among Ohioans. The labor vote, which has increasingly gone to Trump, has also gone to Brown,\u201d said Thomas Sutton, a political science professor and acting president of Baldwin Wallace University. \u201cHe shares some of the same positions as Trump when it comes to protecting local industry, manufacturing [and] support for farmers.\u201d Ohioans have been bombarded with ads featuring Brown riding a speedboat while wearing a bullet-proof vest, a scene meant to depict his tough-on-immigration stance. Critics of Brown say that despite him being an apparent champion of the working class, he has mostly never held a non-political job himself (he worked as a teacher for a few years in the 1970s and 80s). A representative of Brown\u2019s campaign said he was not available for comment for this article. Emails sent to Moreno\u2019s campaign were unanswered. Trump\u2019s endorsement of Moreno, a relative political novice, has energized Ohio\u2019s Maga electorate. \u201cMoreno is doing a pretty good job in handing his campaign over to the professional ad people. They\u2019re using the scare tactics against Brown, tying him to the Biden administration,\u201d said Sutton. A cryptocurrency industry Pac has spent $40m on Moreno\u2019s campaign, while polling conducted for Moreno\u2019s campaign suggests their candidate has a three-point lead over Brown. Other polls suggest a very close race. But Moreno\u2019s run, and his record, are not flawless. Last year, he settled more than a dozen wage-theft lawsuits and was forced to pay more than $400,000 to two former employees of his car dealership. Recently, he has been criticized for telling attenders at a town hall that women over 50 shouldn\u2019t be concerned about reproductive rights. \u201cWhen you take away women\u2019s abortion rights, you take away healthcare, and we in Ohio have voted that that\u2019s none of your business,\u201d said Amy Cox, a Democrat who is running this year to unseat a Republican incumbent in the US House of Representatives in a district that includes Moraine, Dayton and Springfield. Last year, Ohio Democrats and liberals were revitalized by a rare win at the ballot box when voters decided by a 13-point margin to enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution. \u201cWomen and men are really energized by the fall of Roe, and Project 2025 is really motivating people to get out and vote,\u201d said Cox. A bribery scandal involving a failing energy company and leading Ohio Republicans hasn\u2019t helped them.The former speaker of the statehouse, Larry Householder, was jailed for 20 years last year for racketeering. \u201cThis is going to be won and lost in the three C\u2019s,\u201d the cities of Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, said Sutton. And the election will be about \u201cwhether more typically Democratic areas have better mobilization and turnout to counteract what would be normal voter turnout in the Republican-leaning rural and small-town areas\u201d, he added. For Spencer, who lives near the Fuyao Glass factory in Moraine, Moreno\u2019s attack ads that feature Brown\u2019s alleged failures on immigration have hit home. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that if Trump and JD Vance get in, they will deal with what\u2019s going on over there,\u201d he said.",

But what I can assure you and assure your viewers and assure all voters, is that a Dutton-led Coalition government has no plans, no policy and no interest in unwinding women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d Asked for her personal view, she responded: \u201cI don\u2019t see the need to change the laws.\u201d Nationals Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie, backed that in, saying she didn\u2019t think Price\u2019s statements were \u201chelpful\u201d. \u2018The LNP has much to lose \u2013 or fail to gain\u2019 Perhaps the most telling comments came later and from a bloke, who also happened to be a Queenslander and a normally strongly outspoken opponent of abortion. Senator Matt Canavan told journalists this was a sensitive issue and not an issue best prosecuted \u201cin the heat of an election campaign\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be gained by playing it out in a tit-for-tat type process,\u201d he said. In fact, for the LNP in Queensland, there is much to lose \u2013 or to fail to gain. Away from the election context, Canavan has not been shy about expressing his views on the subject. He has sponsored a private senator\u2019s bill in federal parliament, the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, to force medical practitioners to save the life of a child born alive following a pregnancy termination. It sits awaiting a government go-ahead which will never come. The bill was co-sponsored by Victorian United Australia party senator, Ralph Babet, and South Australian Liberal senator, Alex Antic. They seem keen to move things along. On 20 August, Babet moved a motion in the Senate stating that Australia\u2019s health system was enabling inhumane deaths through abortion and noting that \u201cbabies born alive as a result of a failed abortion deserve care\u201d. The speakers in favour included Canavan and David Fawcett, another South Australian Liberal senator. A month later, South Australian state Liberal frontbencher Ben Hood introduced a bill into the state parliament aimed at banning abortion after 28 weeks gestation. With a Labor state government, and only a section of the Liberal opposition in support, it was also destined not to become law. But abortion has been a handy issue for the hard-right in South Australia. When it was decriminalised in 2021, hard-right factional players used the debate to launch a recruiting campaign and succeeded in filling party branches with new members, particularly conservative Christians. The Senate preselections of earlier this year bore the fruits of their labours, with Antic, a rightwing federal backbencher, wresting the top spot on the Senate ticket from the more moderate and far more senior frontbencher and former minister, Anne Ruston. The latest efforts to re-elevate abortion as an issue in South Australia are being seen by those not in the hard right as an attempt to repeat that successful factional endeavour. Federal observers of all these moves say the issue brings together the interests of the honest and the opportunistic \u2013 the true-believer anti-abortionists and those who see political benefit in taking a particular public position. When he introduced the proposed South Australian bill in September, Ben Hood paid tribute to Dr Joanna Howe, an Adelaide University law professor who has been campaigning for \u201cbabies born alive\u201d bills across Australia. \u2018Katter has set his sights on gaining more seats\u2019 In Queensland on Monday, as the state campaign entered its final week before polling on Saturday, Robbie Katter announced that before seeking to have Queensland\u2019s abortion laws repealed, he wanted them amended \u2013 to mandate care for \u201cbabies born alive\u201d. It\u2019s the same language used by like-minded Queenslanders and those further south but there\u2019s suspicion in Coalition ranks about whose interests are being served. Katter has his sights set on gaining more regional Queensland seats, especially in the north. He isn\u2019t a fan of the LNP. Neither is the Queensland Labor government. In late March, that government, under the premier, Steven Miles, legislated to allow nurses to administer pregnancy termination medication in Queensland. The move attracted significant public support and divided the LNP, whose leader David Crisafulli was pressed for his views and ruled out repealing abortion laws if he won the state election. Three weeks later, when Western Australia\u2019s Labor government passed legislation removing legal barriers to abortion there, Steven Miles posted congratulations on his Instagram account under what looked like an advertising slogan. \u201cAbortion is now legal in every state and territory,\u201d it said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it that way.\u201d Fast forward seven months and Katter\u2019s spontaneous reignition of the abortion debate in Queensland has enabled Miles to reinforce that sentiment. His poll figures have suddenly improved as he\u2019s presented himself as the conviction guy, opposed to unwinding the current law. Having repeatedly refused to discuss his own personal position on abortion since Katter lobbed his molotov cocktail, Crisafulli was unable to avoid the issue in Tuesday night\u2019s final pre-election debate. Pressed, he declared himself \u201cpro-choice\u201d. This came after video emerged on Tuesday afternoon of him telling a Griffith University audience last year that he didn\u2019t support re-criminalising abortion but saying, when asked if he was pro-choice, that he didn\u2019t support \u201clate-term abortions\u201d. The whole issue has sucked oxygen out of the LNP\u2019s campaign in the final pre-election weeks. It may also have helped Labor stem a feared outflow to the Greens, with Miles\u2019 sudden siren song of conviction calling back the deserting disillusioned. It\u2019s certainly elevated Robbie Katter\u2019s profile enormously. In politics, there are the true believers and the opportunists, and then those who are a bit of both. Sometimes it can be very hard to tell them all apart. Karen Middleton is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor",

To ensure infrastructure keeps pace with demand, on Tuesday Allan announced the overhaul of a scheme to ensure developers pay for schools, parks and roads in the areas they build. On Wednesday came a 10-year plan to release greenfield land on Melbourne\u2019s fringes, and the proposed sale of government-owned land near Footscray and Oakleigh train stations to facilitate urban growth. A new building watchdog was announced on Thursday to ensure builders rectify substandard work and prevent the sale of defective apartments, as well as a review to make it easier for homeowners to build townhouses on their land. As the week wrapped up, regional housing initiatives were announced, with rental reforms expected to come. Yet the proposal that preceded them all is still creating the most headlines. Last weekend, Allan released a plan to create 50 new higher-density zones around train and tram stations, which could drastically change some of Melbourne\u2019s established suburbs in the south-east, including Armadale, Brighton, Malvern and Toorak. Allan says the plan had been \u201cin her head\u201d for years, stemming from her time as transport infrastructure minister working on level crossing removals. \u201cRemoving level crossings created space,\u201d she says. It happens to be the case that most of the 25 announced \u201cactivity zones\u201d are located in Liberal seats. Allan chose one of them, Brighton, to make the announcement \u2013 and was met with a protest of residents and their local MP James Newbury, who fired up the crowd by warning of potential \u201c20-storey apartment\u201d towers in their streets. Labor MPs and their staff were privately pleased with the display, as it allowed Allan to frame both the Liberals and protesters as \u201cblockers\u201d to the plan. Can\u2019t lose seats you don\u2019t hold Samaras, the pollster, says the plan is an attempt to address the \u201cnumber one issue\u201d among the largest voting block \u2013 Victorians aged under 45. It\u2019s also an issue for older generations, who want their children to be in the property market. \u201cAn overwhelming majority of Australians believe that housing is unattainable for the younger generation,\u201d he says.

      "body": "<h2><strong>A romantic relationship</strong></h2> <p>\u201cAm I staying out of fear, attachment, obligation or&nbsp;genuine love?\u201d That\u2019s the question to ask yourself if you\u2019re not sure whether to break up with a partner, says dating and relationship coach <a href=\"https://katemansfield.com/\">Kate Mansfield</a>. \u201cYou might be enduring unhealthy behaviours because you\u2019re scared of what life would look like without them,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Signs your relationship might have become unhealthy include a lack of trust, consistent disrespect and regular arguments, whether they\u2019re big or small. \u201cBickering over small things is usually a&nbsp;sign of a bigger problem that\u2019s not being openly acknowledged,\u201d says Mansfield. \u201cMeanwhile, disrespect could be verbal put-downs that are positioned as banter or jokes or, at the extreme end, abusive behaviour.\u201d More subtle signs might be a&nbsp;lack of desire to do things together and feeling drained after interacting with your partner.</p> <p>If you feel the relationship <em>has</em> reached the end of&nbsp;the road, it\u2019s a bad idea to call it quits in the heat of&nbsp;an argument.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s best to initiate a breakup when&nbsp;you feel calm, allowing for a constructive conversation,\u201d says Mansfield.</p> <h2><strong>Drinking</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a moment when we know that enough is enough,\u201d says sobriety coach<a href=\"https://www.gillmckay.com/\"> Gill McKay</a>. This isn\u2019t always something obvious, like getting caught drink-driving. \u201cIt could be a series of small incidents accompanied by emotions like shame, disgust or sadness,\u201d she says. \u201cThis could be seeing a loved one roll their eyes at you pouring wine, or your partner commenting on how full the recycling box is.\u201d </p> <p>An easy first step is identifying your motivation for giving up, which could be becoming more healthy, saving money or being more present for your loved ones, says McKay. \u201cOwning your \u2018why\u2019 can give you strength when you have doubts, and want to pour a drink.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>A job</strong></h2> <p>\u201cQuitting your job gets a bad rap, but sometimes it\u2019s the best thing you can do,\u201d says Keren Blackmore, career coach and founder of <a href=\"https://www.leapofthought.com/\">Leap of Thought</a>. Good reasons include a lack of opportunities for growth, such as promotions or training opportunities, or a&nbsp;toxic working environment, which Blackmore describes as \u201can environment where you\u2019ll witness backstabbing, hostility, unreasonable expectations, a consistent lack of clarity\u201d. Alternatively, you may have tried to improve things and been shut down. \u201cIf&nbsp;you feel unheard or have been told that what you&nbsp;have asked for is not likely to happen,\u201d Blackmore says.</p> <p>Don\u2019t mistake the \u201cSunday scaries\u201d for a reason to&nbsp;quit, though, Blackmore adds: \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual to feel a pang of discomfort at the thought of going to work during stressful periods.\u201d Instead, think about why you feel you want to quit, how long you\u2019ve felt like this, and&nbsp;what\u2019s important to you in your career, which could include things like salary, job title, flexibility, parental-leave policy and company culture. Take it slowly \u2013 waiting until you\u2019ve secured any bonuses on&nbsp;the horizon. \u201cUse your remaining time at the organisation to grow your network and skills, and practise talking about your achievements.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A diet</strong></h2> <p>Whether you\u2019re trying a new diet to lose weight or for health or environmental reasons, pay attention to&nbsp;your body\u2019s response. According to Anna Mapson, a nutritional therapist and founder of <a href=\"https://www.goodnessme-nutrition.com/\">Goodness Me Nutrition</a>, it might be time to quit a diet if you\u2019re always feeling hungry, or experience a significant change in bowel habits: \u201cVegan diets may lead to low levels of nutrients such as iron or vitamin B12, and you may find your energy levels drop, you get headaches or feel dizzy.\u201d If this happens, Mapson recommends getting a blood test to check for deficiencies \u2013 you can take supplements if your levels are low, but you might prefer to change your diet.</p> <p>\u201cA diet where a gym trainer or an app\u2019s algorithm has set your carbohydrate, protein and fat consumption could potentially lead to nausea, constipation or bloating,\u201d Mapson says. That\u2019s because you might be eating a&nbsp;set amount of food, irrespective of whether you feel hungry or not, to meet certain protein goals, for example. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to avoid a diet like this, but Mapson suggests adapting the meal plan to suit your body and how you feel. </p> <p>And if a diet is affecting your mental health, don\u2019t ignore it. Mapson says: \u201cIf you\u2019re constantly worrying about what to eat or avoiding social occasions, then you could be happier with a more relaxed approach.\u201d</p>    <h2><strong>A friendship</strong></h2> <p>Wondering if a friendship has run its course? <a href=\"https://www.georginasturmer.co.uk/\">Counsellor Georgina Sturmer</a> says there are a few different warning signs: \u201cIf you start to feel a sense of irritation or boredom at the thought of your friend, or their behaviour, this might be a sign that things aren\u2019t quite right. This might be accompanied by a sense that you have less in common than you used to, or that you are driven to spend time with them solely out of a sense of duty.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling as though you want to hide things from a&nbsp;friend is a red flag \u2013 whether it\u2019s to avoid criticism or ridicule, or to spare their feelings. While we often&nbsp;think of manipulation in terms of romantic relationships, it can be an issue in friendships, too. Sturmer says: \u201cFeeling pressured to behave in ways that feel uncomfortable or unhealthy, such as spending beyond our means or being encouraged to&nbsp;dislike certain friends\u201d are giveaways.</p> <p>Before you do anything to end the friendship, stop&nbsp;to think if any problems could be fixable. Are they short-term and tied to your friend going through difficult times? If you do decide to end the friendship, make sure you \u201cbehave with integrity and kindness\u201d, says Sturmer. This means considering whether you should explain why you don\u2019t want to be friends, or&nbsp;if it\u2019s kinder to be less confrontational.</p> <h2><strong>A hobby</strong></h2> <p>It can be hard to let go of a hobby you\u2019ve invested time and money in by signing up to classes or buying&nbsp;equipment, but if you\u2019re ready to quit don\u2019t let this stop you. \u201cQuitting can be the portal to an entirely new hobby \u2013 why delay the revelation?\u201d says&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.juliakeller.net/\">Julia Keller</a>, author of Quitting: A Life Strategy. \u201cWe outgrow hobbies, and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to&nbsp;discover new ones.\u201d A sign the time has come to make that move? \u201cWhen you\u2019re no longer looking forward to it with zeal.\u201d</p> <p>Keller suggests examining when you started feeling unenthusiastic about your hobby and whether something else was going on in your life: \u201cMaybe the problem isn\u2019t with the hobby, but with something completely unrelated that\u2019s temporary, such as being overwhelmed by work. Often we toss away everything in our attempt to fix&nbsp;one thing.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re on the fence about quitting your hobby, Keller suggests taking a temporary pause, rather than stopping altogether, to see if you miss it. \u201cBut if&nbsp;you\u2019re not relishing a hobby, move on,\u201d she says.</p> <h2><strong>An exercise regime</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.hcahealthcare.co.uk/finder/stepconsultantprofile/dr-richard-seah-3\">Dr Rick Seah</a>, consultant in musculoskeletal, sport and exercise medicine at <a href=\"https://www.hcahealthcare.co.uk/locations/hospitals/the-wellington-hospital\">the Wellington hospital</a> in London, says a high incidence of injuries, plateauing results, excessive fatigue and prolonged recovery periods are useful pointers to look at adjusting your exercise regime. But he recommends not giving up on exercise completely. \u201cIt\u2019s worth considering why these issues may be occurring,\u201d Seah says. \u201cFor example, it is generally not sensible to train hard during periods of acute illness, when the body prioritises its&nbsp;resources to enable it to return to good health as&nbsp;opposed to performance optimisation.\u201d</p> <p>Many people mistake pain as a reason to stop a&nbsp;new exercise regime, says Seah, but \u201creducing rather than stopping will resolve many issues\u201d. For&nbsp;example, if you were a good runner in your 20s and have taken it up again in your 40s, you might experience pain as you adapt. \u201cIn this instance, it&nbsp;would be sensible to ease off on the weekly training sessions and moderate the intensity,\u201d says Seah.</p> <p>He also advises sticking to an exercise regime for somewhere between a few weeks and a few months before quitting, and reflecting on whether you enjoy the activity, how it fits with your fitness goals, and if&nbsp;you can see yourself doing it long-term.</p> <h2><strong>A book</strong></h2> <p>If you\u2019ve started a book, do you have to finish it? John&nbsp;Clegg, bookseller for the <a href=\"https://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/\">London Review Bookshop</a>, says there are some tell-tale signs that you should let go: \u201cIf it\u2019s a novel and you can\u2019t remember the characters or distinguish between them; or if&nbsp;it\u2019s nonfiction and it fees like you\u2019ve been cornered by the most boring guest at a party\u201d. If&nbsp;you\u2019re on the&nbsp;brink of giving up, ask yourself: \u201cDo&nbsp;you have anything better to read? Or are you just cross with the book because you\u2019re tired or in a bad mood?\u201d</p> <p>Clegg recommends reading at least 10&nbsp;pages of the&nbsp;book before calling it quits. But if you\u2019re close to&nbsp;the end, he suggests persevering: \u201cIf you\u2019re within a couple of chapters, you should probably press on to&nbsp;the bitter end, if only so you can give an&nbsp;authoritative anti-recommendation.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Social media</strong></h2> <p>If you\u2019re concerned about your social media usage, ask yourself what purpose it\u2019s serving. \u201cIs it making you smarter? Kinder? Better informed? Happier? More prosperous?\u201d asks Keller.<strong> </strong>If not, then reassess your use. \u201cQuit or drastically reduce your time on&nbsp;social media if it feels as if it is distorting your relationship with reality and basic happiness.\u201d</p> <p>An example would be if you go for dinner with your partner and you both sit scrolling on your phones rather than chatting to each other. \u201cWhen the human beings you care about are playing second&nbsp;fiddle to holiday photos, you\u2019ve reached a&nbsp;tipping point,\u201d says Keller.</p> <p>Cal Newport, author of Digital Minimalism, suggests taking a pause as a starting point: \u201cIf you use these services and feel uneasy about how much time they demand, take a 30-day break. See what it\u2019s&nbsp;like without these digital diversions.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "While the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, grapples with the parlous \u00a340bn funding gap in Britain\u2019s finances, another \u00a325bn of annual revenue is revving up to disappear into the sunset. As the Treasury knows all too well, turning cars electric will spell the end of that great money-spinner fuel duty. But no one appears ready to grab the wheel and tax motoring in a different way. Road pricing was the future, once, and Tony Blair, its last champion in Downing Street, is back via his TBI thinktank to push it again. Proponents of road pricing \u2013 or metering, charging, pay-per-mile \u2013 have traditionally been driven by two impulses: managing road congestion, and raising revenue fairly from motoring. The former most concerned the last Labour government; the latter has become a clear and present danger for the Treasury. That \u00a325bn from fuel duty, levied on petrol and diesel at the pumps, more or less covers the entire cost of Britain\u2019s road and railway system. Electric cars, which pay zero fuel duty, make up almost a fifth of new registrations. The TBI is the latest group to weigh in ahead of Reeves\u2019 30 October budget, urging her to introduce a road charge of 1p per mile for cars and vans, and 2.5p to 4p for lorries and HGVs \u2013 \u201ca crucial step in reforming motoring taxation for the electric-vehicle era [and] preventing a growth-stifling rise in congestion\u201d. It follows the Campaign for Better Transport, which suggests pay-per-mile charges initially for electric vehicles only. A host of other groups, including the RAC, have also declared the need for similar reform. The head of the National Infrastructure Commission, Sir John Armitt, said road pricing was \u201cinevitable\u201d. But is it?

Inflationary rises \u2013 the kind applied to rail fares \u2013 would have pushed duty past \u00a31 per litre, netting the exchequer at least \u00a320bn a year more today. Comparatively low oil prices, the need for revenue and this budget\u2019s timing in the electoral cycle make this a ripe moment to raise fuel duty. Or, instead, as the TBI advises, introduce road pricing at a level that would raise the same amount as restoring the fuel duty cut \u2013 about \u00a33bn \u2013 demonstrating that the reform will not be taxing motorists more overall.

      "body": "<p>When Elizabeth Steere\u2019s two sons were little, the family watched The Wizard of Oz and its famous tornado scene that whips Dorothy through the air.</p> <p>Steere, who lives in Asheville, North Carolina, assured her kids, now 11 and 13, not to worry. \u201cI remember saying, very glibly, \u2018That\u2019s not something <em>you</em> guys have to worry about,\u2019\u201d Steele recalled.</p> <p>Then on 26 September, Helene struck the region as a tropical storm, killing scores of people, destroying whole towns, tearing apart roads, downing power lines, and contaminating water supplies. The waters damaged several schools in the region and left many without potable water.</p> <p>Nearly a month later, about 76,000 students in western North Carolina are still out of school and families are scrambling to cope with the loss of routine and structure.</p> <p>\u201cI never imagined that we\u2019d have this level of disruption due to weather,\u201d said Ashley Mosley, who went with her two children to her mother\u2019s home in Mississippi while waiting for local schools to reopen. \u201cAsheville is a place that people move to get away from that \u2013 from hurricane-prone areas or wildfire-prone areas. I think none of us ever saw this coming.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the closures in North Carolina are due to lack of safe drinking water and road repairs, and officials in Asheville said public schools were set to reopen on 28 October.</p> <p>Globally, climate-related disasters disrupt the education of some <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/media/147931/file/Theclimage-changedchild-ReportinEnglish.pdf\">40 million children</a> each year, according to Unicef, whose researchers say that figure is on the rise as the intensity and frequency of heat and storms increase.</p> <p>Schools in <a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/line-fire-school-closures-oct-2-2024/3525498/\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2024/09/11/davis-fire-wednesday-updates-wcsd-schools-closed-as-fire-expected-to-move-north/75170260007/\">Nevada</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kdrv.com/news/top-stories/chiloquin-schools-closed-due-to-copperfield-fire/article_e3146fb2-69f4-11ef-9ac7-3f46483566aa.html\">Oregon</a> have closed in recent weeks due to wildfires, and across the country districts have closed due to extreme heat. Just weeks after Helene, Hurricane Milton forced schools across Florida to briefly close.</p> <p>The impacts aren\u2019t felt evenly: students from vulnerable populations face \u201cheightened challenges\u201d according to a <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104606.pdf\">2022 federal report</a> on disaster recovery. \u201c[T]he disasters caused significant emotional trauma to students due to stressors including extended housing instability, food insecurity, parental job loss and social disconnection,\u201d the authors wrote.</p> <p>About <a href=\"https://carolinademography.cpc.unc.edu/2024/10/17/low-income-students-in-western-north-carolina-and-the-long-road-to-recovery-after-helene/\">44%</a> of children in Asheville public schools are economically disadvantaged, according to a population research center at UNC Chapel Hill, meaning they have a household income less than 185% of the federal poverty line.</p>    <p>It\u2019s not just closures that affect kids\u2019 ability to learn. Researchers have <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-04/CLiME_Final%20Report.pdf\">linked</a> extreme heat during the school year with learning loss, and lower-income students, who are less likely to have air-conditioned classrooms and homes, are often the most vulnerable. Wildfires have also been found to \u201cgenerate significant negative impacts on academic performance among younger children\u201d, according to 2022 <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06050-9\">analysis</a> in Scientific Reports. Air pollution associated with fires is also associated with higher rates of asthma in children.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had an intentional conversation [about how] climate change is real, and let\u2019s talk about the different ways it\u2019s impacted our schools from the temperature recess to the temperature for football practice and field hockey practice,\u201d said an Asheville schools spokesperson, Kimberly Dechant. She added that district officials were currently writing grant proposals for after-school tutoring to help kids catch up following the closures.</p> <p>Researchers say the learning disruptions, paired with the trauma of the disaster itself, can set children back for years.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely devastating, especially since students rely on going to school for that sense of normalcy,\u201d says Dr Cassandra R Davis, assistant professor in the department of public policy of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She studies community resilience following disasters and has found that, among schoolchildren, one age group tends to fare the worst: \u201cWe found that, especially for elementary students, that they regress.\u201d</p> <p>Research on pandemic-related learning loss provides some clues about who suffers most from school disruptions. According to <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/covid-19-and-education-the-lingering-effects-of-unfinished-learning\">a 2021 McKinsey analysis</a> of the the impact of the pandemic on K\u201312 learning, students at predominantly low-income schools and in urban locations fared worse than those in higher-income and suburban locations.</p> <p>In addition to the academic disruption, there is the emotional fallout from the disaster. Davis recalled that after Hurricane Matthew struck in October 2016, educators \u201cspoke about how their students in April were still becoming very emotional when it rained outside, thinking that that would be the next hurricane\u201d \u2013 six months later.</p> <p>Steere says one of the most difficult disruptions for her kids has been missing \u201chuman contact and their social lives\u201d. Her older son was desperate for cell service to reach his peers, she said, adding that his charter school reopened last week.</p> <p>Steere\u2019s 11-year-old son, who has autism, has struggled with the lack of structure school typically provides. \u201cFor autistic kids, routine is everything,\u201d she said. \u201cRoutine is king, and school offers routine.\u201d</p> <p>Her younger son has been attending a bridge learning program set up by the school district for two hours a day while he waits for his school to reopen. Steere is grateful he\u2019s able to socialize, but said it \u201chas been a different building, a bunch of different people, a very crowded classroom and probably very noisy\u201d. His favorite playground, located near an RV park, was also damaged when several RVs smashed into it during the flood.</p> <p>Mosley, a clinical psychologist, said that she enrolled her two kids in school in Mississippi \u2013 one in kindergarten, one in third-grade \u2013 for a couple weeks in part so she could continue to work. The assumption among families was that \u201cwhen water came back, school would come back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were being given these estimates of weeks to months for water [to return]. And I couldn\u2019t go weeks to months without a paycheck.\u201d</p> <p>Asheville school administrators are shipping in outside drinking water ahead of next week\u2019s reopening. Though officials expect most students will return, Dechant said that so far, they have received 15 student records requests from other school systems. Some families said they plan to return at the end of the semester, she said. But others may relocate entirely.</p> <p>\u201c[The superintendent] has said all along you have to do what\u2019s best for your family,\u201d Dechant said.</p> <p>Steere said it had been a relief to have her older son return to his charter school, and that teachers were helping students process Helene and its aftermath. \u201cThey had them write about their hurricane experiences, and he wrote a poem yesterday about the [River Arts District],\u201d she said. \u201cI think that really helped him \u2013 like, he was really proud and wanted to show it to us.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cAnd that\u2019s something schools can offer, right?

      "bodyText": "When Elizabeth Steere\u2019s two sons were little, the family watched The Wizard of Oz and its famous tornado scene that whips Dorothy through the air. Steere, who lives in Asheville, North Carolina, assured her kids, now 11 and 13, not to worry. \u201cI remember saying, very glibly, \u2018That\u2019s not something you guys have to worry about,\u2019\u201d Steele recalled. Then on 26 September, Helene struck the region as a tropical storm, killing scores of people, destroying whole towns, tearing apart roads, downing power lines, and contaminating water supplies. The waters damaged several schools in the region and left many without potable water. Nearly a month later, about 76,000 students in western North Carolina are still out of school and families are scrambling to cope with the loss of routine and structure. \u201cI never imagined that we\u2019d have this level of disruption due to weather,\u201d said Ashley Mosley, who went with her two children to her mother\u2019s home in Mississippi while waiting for local schools to reopen. \u201cAsheville is a place that people move to get away from that \u2013 from hurricane-prone areas or wildfire-prone areas. I think none of us ever saw this coming.\u201d Many of the closures in North Carolina are due to lack of safe drinking water and road repairs, and officials in Asheville said public schools were set to reopen on 28 October. Globally, climate-related disasters disrupt the education of some 40 million children each year, according to Unicef, whose researchers say that figure is on the rise as the intensity and frequency of heat and storms increase. Schools in California, Nevada and Oregon have closed in recent weeks due to wildfires, and across the country districts have closed due to extreme heat. Just weeks after Helene, Hurricane Milton forced schools across Florida to briefly close. The impacts aren\u2019t felt evenly: students from vulnerable populations face \u201cheightened challenges\u201d according to a 2022 federal report on disaster recovery. \u201c[T]he disasters caused significant emotional trauma to students due to stressors including extended housing instability, food insecurity, parental job loss and social disconnection,\u201d the authors wrote. About 44% of children in Asheville public schools are economically disadvantaged, according to a population research center at UNC Chapel Hill, meaning they have a household income less than 185% of the federal poverty line. It\u2019s not just closures that affect kids\u2019 ability to learn. Researchers have linked extreme heat during the school year with learning loss, and lower-income students, who are less likely to have air-conditioned classrooms and homes, are often the most vulnerable. Wildfires have also been found to \u201cgenerate significant negative impacts on academic performance among younger children\u201d, according to 2022 analysis in Scientific Reports. Air pollution associated with fires is also associated with higher rates of asthma in children. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had an intentional conversation [about how] climate change is real, and let\u2019s talk about the different ways it\u2019s impacted our schools from the temperature recess to the temperature for football practice and field hockey practice,\u201d said an Asheville schools spokesperson, Kimberly Dechant. She added that district officials were currently writing grant proposals for after-school tutoring to help kids catch up following the closures. Researchers say the learning disruptions, paired with the trauma of the disaster itself, can set children back for years. \u201cIt\u2019s completely devastating, especially since students rely on going to school for that sense of normalcy,\u201d says Dr Cassandra R Davis, assistant professor in the department of public policy of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She studies community resilience following disasters and has found that, among schoolchildren, one age group tends to fare the worst: \u201cWe found that, especially for elementary students, that they regress.\u201d Research on pandemic-related learning loss provides some clues about who suffers most from school disruptions. According to a 2021 McKinsey analysis of the the impact of the pandemic on K\u201312 learning, students at predominantly low-income schools and in urban locations fared worse than those in higher-income and suburban locations. In addition to the academic disruption, there is the emotional fallout from the disaster. Davis recalled that after Hurricane Matthew struck in October 2016, educators \u201cspoke about how their students in April were still becoming very emotional when it rained outside, thinking that that would be the next hurricane\u201d \u2013 six months later. Steere says one of the most difficult disruptions for her kids has been missing \u201chuman contact and their social lives\u201d. Her older son was desperate for cell service to reach his peers, she said, adding that his charter school reopened last week. Steere\u2019s 11-year-old son, who has autism, has struggled with the lack of structure school typically provides. \u201cFor autistic kids, routine is everything,\u201d she said. \u201cRoutine is king, and school offers routine.\u201d Her younger son has been attending a bridge learning program set up by the school district for two hours a day while he waits for his school to reopen. Steere is grateful he\u2019s able to socialize, but said it \u201chas been a different building, a bunch of different people, a very crowded classroom and probably very noisy\u201d. His favorite playground, located near an RV park, was also damaged when several RVs smashed into it during the flood. Mosley, a clinical psychologist, said that she enrolled her two kids in school in Mississippi \u2013 one in kindergarten, one in third-grade \u2013 for a couple weeks in part so she could continue to work. The assumption among families was that \u201cwhen water came back, school would come back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were being given these estimates of weeks to months for water [to return]. And I couldn\u2019t go weeks to months without a paycheck.\u201d Asheville school administrators are shipping in outside drinking water ahead of next week\u2019s reopening. Though officials expect most students will return, Dechant said that so far, they have received 15 student records requests from other school systems. Some families said they plan to return at the end of the semester, she said. But others may relocate entirely. \u201c[The superintendent] has said all along you have to do what\u2019s best for your family,\u201d Dechant said. Steere said it had been a relief to have her older son return to his charter school, and that teachers were helping students process Helene and its aftermath. \u201cThey had them write about their hurricane experiences, and he wrote a poem yesterday about the [River Arts District],\u201d she said. \u201cI think that really helped him \u2013 like, he was really proud and wanted to show it to us.\u201d She continued: \u201cAnd that\u2019s something schools can offer, right? I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d",

In the buildup to next week\u2019s budget there has been ever-increasing scrutiny and a parallel lack of clarity about what Labour\u2019s manifesto commitment to not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d actually means in practice.</p> <p>While ministers may want to insist that nothing can be given away in advance of a budget, they have faced inevitable questions about what they would view as a working person, often with mixed results.</p> <p>Speaking to broadcasters in Samoa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/24/keir-starmer-hints-at-tax-rises-on-people-with-income-from-assets\">Keir Starmer said</a> he would not use the term for people who had income from assets such as shares or property. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come within my definition,\u201d he said. Downing Street <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2024/oct/25/commonwealth-summit-samoa-keir-starmer-autumn-budget-labour-rachel-reeves-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-news?page=with:block-671b5b618f08b5c740d89e9f#block-671b5b618f08b5c740d89e9f\">hastily clarified</a> that the prime minister did not mean people who owned small amounts of, for example, stocks or shares.</p> <p>There was, inevitably, a long round of questions at the subsequent No 10 media briefing about precisely who did fit the definition. Starmer\u2019s spokesperson set this out as \u201cthose who have to rely on their pay packets and do not always have the means to write a cheque, and it is those who are hardest hit by economic instability\u201d.</p> <p>What the PM had been referring to, she added, was \u201cthe broadest sense of who was in his mind\u2019s eye when it comes to the importance of economic stability\u201d \u2013 in other words, to an extent a working person is whoever Starmer sees them as being.</p> <p>Amid this slightly salad-like cascade of words sit two interlocking definitions, the first economic and relatively precise, the other political and notably more woolly.</p> <p>As more or less defined by the No 10 spokesperson, a working person is, for the most part, someone whose income is reliant on a regular wage, as distinct from someone who can rely on money from unearned wealth, for example rental income or share dividends.</p> <p>The two can, of course, cross over, hence the focus on where the bulk of someone\u2019s income derives. The National Residential Landlords Association rushed out a statement on Friday noting that 30% of landlords have full-time jobs and another 10% work part-time.</p> <p>Many people will still be uncertain where they sit. Speaking to the BBC on Friday morning, David Blunkett, the Labour peer and Blair-era cabinet minister, said he had been stopped by several recently retired people who asked where they fitted under the \u201cworking people\u201d categorisation. \u201cI don\u2019t have a particular answer for them, actually,\u201d Blunkett confessed.</p> <p>The political definition is even more vague, with \u201cworking people\u201d routinely used as an all-encompassing synonym for the sort of diligent, taxpaying, family-raising voters at whom almost all political parties mentally pitch their ideas.</p> <p>To use one example, the 12 references in the Conservative manifesto sets them out as citizens who will benefit variously from lower taxes, higher pay, continued consumer protections and more pragmatic net zero policies.</p> <p>These worlds, however, have noisily intersected in the Labour document, with its very specific promise on taxes. In practical terms, this will almost certainly mean some higher taxes on unearned income, for example capital gains tax.</p> <p>As set out repeatedly during the election, it will not involve increases to VAT, income tax or national insurance \u2013 or at least the NI paid by employees. That leaves a large patch of contested middle ground including things such as employers\u2019 NI contributions, whether or not tax thresholds are raised, and fuel duty.</p> <p>So by Wednesday afternoon, will you know whether the government sees you as a working person? Possibly not. Will the arguments continue? Definitely.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is a phrase that crops up 21 times in the Labour manifesto, 12 times in the Conservative manifesto, and has been used in the House of Commons more than 3,500 times in the last decade. So, surely everyone knows what \u201cworking people\u201d are \u2013 don\u2019t we? Perhaps not. In the buildup to next week\u2019s budget there has been ever-increasing scrutiny and a parallel lack of clarity about what Labour\u2019s manifesto commitment to not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d actually means in practice. While ministers may want to insist that nothing can be given away in advance of a budget, they have faced inevitable questions about what they would view as a working person, often with mixed results. Speaking to broadcasters in Samoa, Keir Starmer said he would not use the term for people who had income from assets such as shares or property. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come within my definition,\u201d he said. Downing Street hastily clarified that the prime minister did not mean people who owned small amounts of, for example, stocks or shares. There was, inevitably, a long round of questions at the subsequent No 10 media briefing about precisely who did fit the definition. Starmer\u2019s spokesperson set this out as \u201cthose who have to rely on their pay packets and do not always have the means to write a cheque, and it is those who are hardest hit by economic instability\u201d. What the PM had been referring to, she added, was \u201cthe broadest sense of who was in his mind\u2019s eye when it comes to the importance of economic stability\u201d \u2013 in other words, to an extent a working person is whoever Starmer sees them as being. Amid this slightly salad-like cascade of words sit two interlocking definitions, the first economic and relatively precise, the other political and notably more woolly. As more or less defined by the No 10 spokesperson, a working person is, for the most part, someone whose income is reliant on a regular wage, as distinct from someone who can rely on money from unearned wealth, for example rental income or share dividends. The two can, of course, cross over, hence the focus on where the bulk of someone\u2019s income derives. The National Residential Landlords Association rushed out a statement on Friday noting that 30% of landlords have full-time jobs and another 10% work part-time. Many people will still be uncertain where they sit. Speaking to the BBC on Friday morning, David Blunkett, the Labour peer and Blair-era cabinet minister, said he had been stopped by several recently retired people who asked where they fitted under the \u201cworking people\u201d categorisation. \u201cI don\u2019t have a particular answer for them, actually,\u201d Blunkett confessed. The political definition is even more vague, with \u201cworking people\u201d routinely used as an all-encompassing synonym for the sort of diligent, taxpaying, family-raising voters at whom almost all political parties mentally pitch their ideas. To use one example, the 12 references in the Conservative manifesto sets them out as citizens who will benefit variously from lower taxes, higher pay, continued consumer protections and more pragmatic net zero policies. These worlds, however, have noisily intersected in the Labour document, with its very specific promise on taxes. In practical terms, this will almost certainly mean some higher taxes on unearned income, for example capital gains tax. As set out repeatedly during the election, it will not involve increases to VAT, income tax or national insurance \u2013 or at least the NI paid by employees. That leaves a large patch of contested middle ground including things such as employers\u2019 NI contributions, whether or not tax thresholds are raised, and fuel duty. So by Wednesday afternoon, will you know whether the government sees you as a working person? Possibly not. Will the arguments continue? Definitely.",

      "body": "<p>In December 1938, Lore Segal, who has died aged 96, was one of the first 500 children taken by the Kindertransport from Vienna to London. \u201cIt took me 13 years to get from England to New York,\u201d she said, and her journey formed the basis of her first book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/17/other-peoples-houses-lore-segal-review\">Other People\u2019s Houses</a>, stories originally serialised in the New Yorker, published in 1964. Most of her writing would draw on her own experience, and her sharp sense of observation; her real talent was bringing out that experience in brilliantly crafted prose. Her focus was not just on the difficulties of the outsider, but also the pressures that brought people together and often tore them apart.</p> <p>She was born in Vienna, where her father, Ignatz Groszman, was chief accountant for a bank; her mother, Franziska (nee Stern), was a housewife. When the Anschluss joined Austria to Nazi Germany in 1938, Ignatz lost his job and home. Seeing what was coming, the family applied to emigrate to the US, and sent 10-year-old Lore to Britain on the Kindertransport. She recalled the moment she left; everyone else was crying, but she was not. \u201cHow interesting, I thought, that I am not crying. I realised I\u2019d decided to give up grief, and go for interesting.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She wrote slowly, constantly searching for the perfect phrase</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although her parents managed to get British visas as domestic servants, and joined her a few months later, her father, as a German-speaking immigrant, was interned on the Isle of Man; he died a few days before the war ended. Meanwhile, Lore moved frequently with her mother\u2019s positions. During an illness in 1940, her mother read Dickens to her. When she finally went outside she saw, in Guildford, a solitary rose on a bush covered with snow, which struck her as a metaphor for the Jews of her homeland. She resolved to be a writer, and, partly to explain to the mostly unaware English, filled her notebooks with \u201cmy Hitler stories\u201d.</p> <p>In 1948 she took a degree in English literature at Bedford College for Women, University of London, then she and her mother joined her grandparents and uncle in the Dominican Republic, awaiting US visas. They worked on a farm and her grandfather ran a shop, before Lore, her mother and her uncle finally moved to Washington Heights, New York, which had so many German Jewish immigrants it was known as Frankfurt on Hudson. Lore worked as a clerk and secretary and took night courses. </p> <p>In a creative writing class at the New School for Social Research, she met Horace Cayton, a much older, black sociologist; she called it love at first sight. Although the relationship was doomed by his alcoholism, it provided the core of her 1985 novel, Her First American, in which a Jewish refugee, Ilka Weissnix, falls in love with Carter Bayoux, a diffident, alcoholic, black intellectual. Weissnix, phonetically, can mean \u201cknow nothing\u201d in German, but also, as Bayoux points out to her, \u201cnot white\u201d. The critic Carolyn Kizer said Segal \u201cmay have come closer than anyone to writing the Great American Novel\u201d.</p> <p>Segal was already submitting stories; at the Yaddo writers\u2019 retreat in upstate New York in 1960 she learned that her first story about leaving Vienna had been taken by the New Yorker. Her relationship with Cayton had ended, and she had been fixed up with David Segal, whom she married in 1961. Segal, unhappy in his father\u2019s garment business and perhaps inspired by his wife\u2019s success, became an editor at the publishers Alfred Knopf. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Lore received a number of fellowships allowing her to work on translations: with the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/20/wd-snodgrass-dies\">WD Snodgrass</a> she published Christian Morgenstern\u2019s Gallows Songs (1967) and, with another poet, Randall Jarrell, The Juniper Tree (1973), a classic collection of Brothers Grimm stories, illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/08/maurice-sendak\">Maurice Sendak</a>. In 1970 the first of her eight children\u2019s books, Tell Me a Mitzi, told of a grandmother who arrives to look after her daughter\u2019s kids.</p>    <p>In that year David died of a heart attack, leaving Lore with their daughter, Beatrice, and son, Jacob. The family lived on Riverside Drive in Upper Manhattan, where her mother had an apartment in the same building. Franziska helped with the children, allowing Lore time to write and teach, originally close by at Columbia, Princeton and Sarah Lawrence, but eventually in positions at the University of Illinois Chicago and the Ohio State University, to which she would commute from New York. She had breakfast with her mother every day until Franziska, at 97, announced she would be more comfortable in a nursing home. She died in 2005, aged 100.</p> <p>Lore drew on her experience at Yaddo for her short novel Lucinella (1976), in which Zeus and Hera intrude in the lascivious world of an artists\u2019 and writers\u2019 retreat; the story seems to be a New World take on the sensibility of fin de si\u00e8cle Viennese intellectual society. Segal wrote slowly, constantly searching for the perfect phrase. Her next book, Shakespeare\u2019s Kitchen (2007), was crafted from seven New Yorker stories and six previously unpublished ones. Its main character, again called Ilka, is a visiting scholar at a thinktank attached to a small university in Connecticut, where the personal intrigues are framed by a symposium about genocide. It was nominated for a Pulitzer prize.</p> <p>Her later books dealt with ageing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/30/half-kingdom-lore-segal-review\">Half the Kingdom</a> (2013) was a novel in which stories were told by another Ilka. The fiction collection <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/literature/fiction/ladies-lunch-lore-segal-book-review-sheena-joughin\">Ladies\u2019 Lunch</a> (2023) gathered elderly artists and writers in Manhattan; the title story had appeared in the New Yorker and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/07/the-journal-i-did-not-keep-lore-segal-review\">The Journal I Did Not Keep</a> (2019), which mixed journalism and fiction. She said she had never kept a journal: \u201cI assumed memory would be my editor.\u201d</p> <p>Her final story, Stories About Us, was <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/07/stories-about-us-fiction-lore-segal\">published in the New Yorker</a> in September. It features Lucinella and Grandmother Mole from her children\u2019s books, and in it Ilka is trying to translate a 1938 poem by Theodor Kramer. The last verse recalls her Guildford roses:</p> <p><em>Who is outside ringing at the door?</em><br><em>How the fu</em><em>chsia blooms so near</em><br><em>Dearest, pack me my toothbrush,</em><br><em>And don\u2019t cry,</em><br><em>They are here.</em></p> <p>Segal spoke of the \u201cemotional backpack\u201d she kept ready. She said she considered her later life \u201ca fortunate interim, in my head\u201d. In an interview <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/magazine/lore-segal-writing-death.html\">published the day before she died</a>, she said: \u201cBeing old is being old. Dying is dying. You must not be scared to say it.\u201d </p> <p>She is survived by her children.</p> <p> \u2022 Lore Segal, writer, born 8 March 1928; died 7 October 2024</p>",

Her relationship with Cayton had ended, and she had been fixed up with David Segal, whom she married in 1961. Segal, unhappy in his father\u2019s garment business and perhaps inspired by his wife\u2019s success, became an editor at the publishers Alfred Knopf. Meanwhile, Lore received a number of fellowships allowing her to work on translations: with the poet WD Snodgrass she published Christian Morgenstern\u2019s Gallows Songs (1967) and, with another poet, Randall Jarrell, The Juniper Tree (1973), a classic collection of Brothers Grimm stories, illustrated by Maurice Sendak. In 1970 the first of her eight children\u2019s books, Tell Me a Mitzi, told of a grandmother who arrives to look after her daughter\u2019s kids. In that year David died of a heart attack, leaving Lore with their daughter, Beatrice, and son, Jacob. The family lived on Riverside Drive in Upper Manhattan, where her mother had an apartment in the same building. Franziska helped with the children, allowing Lore time to write and teach, originally close by at Columbia, Princeton and Sarah Lawrence, but eventually in positions at the University of Illinois Chicago and the Ohio State University, to which she would commute from New York. She had breakfast with her mother every day until Franziska, at 97, announced she would be more comfortable in a nursing home. She died in 2005, aged 100. Lore drew on her experience at Yaddo for her short novel Lucinella (1976), in which Zeus and Hera intrude in the lascivious world of an artists\u2019 and writers\u2019 retreat; the story seems to be a New World take on the sensibility of fin de si\u00e8cle Viennese intellectual society. Segal wrote slowly, constantly searching for the perfect phrase. Her next book, Shakespeare\u2019s Kitchen (2007), was crafted from seven New Yorker stories and six previously unpublished ones. Its main character, again called Ilka, is a visiting scholar at a thinktank attached to a small university in Connecticut, where the personal intrigues are framed by a symposium about genocide. It was nominated for a Pulitzer prize. Her later books dealt with ageing. Half the Kingdom (2013) was a novel in which stories were told by another Ilka. The fiction collection Ladies\u2019 Lunch (2023) gathered elderly artists and writers in Manhattan; the title story had appeared in the New Yorker and in The Journal I Did Not Keep (2019), which mixed journalism and fiction. She said she had never kept a journal: \u201cI assumed memory would be my editor.\u201d Her final story, Stories About Us, was published in the New Yorker in September. It features Lucinella and Grandmother Mole from her children\u2019s books, and in it Ilka is trying to translate a 1938 poem by Theodor Kramer. The last verse recalls her Guildford roses: Who is outside ringing at the door? How the fuchsia blooms so near Dearest, pack me my toothbrush, And don\u2019t cry, They are here. Segal spoke of the \u201cemotional backpack\u201d she kept ready. She said she considered her later life \u201ca fortunate interim, in my head\u201d. In an interview published the day before she died, she said: \u201cBeing old is being old. Dying is dying. You must not be scared to say it.\u201d She is survived by her children. \u2022 Lore Segal, writer, born 8 March 1928; died 7 October 2024",

Speaking on Friday morning, the New Labour grandee David Blunkett warned that it could set a tone that would be reflected in local and byelection results across the parliament. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a second term, to do what you really want to do, on a long term basis, then you have to keep a degree of popularity,\u201d he told the BBC.",

      "body": "<p>They range from top generals to reality stars to lawyers, but one thing all these people have in common: they have worked closely with Donald Trump and have gone public with their warnings on what they really think of him.</p>  <h2>John Kelly</h2>    <p><strong>What he did under Trump:</strong> A retired US Marine Corps general, Kelly served first as Trump\u2019s secretary of homeland security in 2017, then was appointed White House chief of staff, a role he held from July 2017 to January 2019. Kelly\u2019s departure from the White House followed reports of the general\u2019s declining relationship with Trump and alleged frequent disagreements. In 2018, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/kelly-is-expected-to-leave-post-as-trump-shakes-up-administration-1544204965\">reported</a> that Trump told an associate to \u201cstop calling John for anything\u201d. According to the veteran journalist Bob Woodward in his 2018 book Fear, Kelly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/08/john-kelly-trump-white-house-chief-of-staff\">called</a> Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d and the head of a \u201cCrazytown\u201d administration.</p> <p><strong>What he says now:</strong> Kelly recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html\">said</a> his former boss fitted \u201cinto the general definition of fascist\u201d who \u201ccertainly prefers the dictator approach to government\u201d.</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;Chief of staff, 2017-19&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Mark Milley</h2>    <p><strong>What he did under Trump:</strong> A retired US army general, Milley served as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under Trump and Joe Biden. Under Trump, Milley became the national focus in June 2020 when he participated in Trump\u2019s photo op at St John\u2019s church in Washington DC wearing military fatigues, amid ongoing demonstrations following the police murder of George Floyd. He publicly apologized for the appearance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/11/top-us-military-general-mark-milley-issues-public-apology-trump-church-photo-op\">saying</a>: \u201cI should not have been there.\u201d Reports later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/28/mark-milley-us-general-trump-shouting-match\">emerged</a> that Milley \u201cyelled\u201d at Trump and refused to be in charge of the federal response to the racial justice protests.</p> <p><strong>What he says about Trump now:</strong> Milley has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/bob-woodward-book-mark-milley-trump\">called</a> Trump a \u201cfascist to the core\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/08/08/mark-milley-trump-draft-resignation-letter\">was doing</a> \u201cgreat and irreparable harm\u201d.</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;Chair of joint chiefs of staff, 2019-23&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Mark Esper</h2>    <p><strong>What he did under Trump: </strong>The politician and marketing executive served as defense secretary under Trump from July 2019 until November 2020, when Trump fired him with a tweet. During his tenure Esper repeatedly clashed with Trump, refusing to send \u201cmissiles into Mexico to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/06/trump-proposal-iranian-military-figure-book-mark-esper\">destroy</a> the drug labs\u201d and to to deploy troops across the country amid the 2020 racial justice protests. Esper publicly opposed Trump\u2019s threat to levy the military against protesters using the 1807 Insurrection Act, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">telling</a> journalists: \u201cThe option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used \u2026 in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What he says about Trump now:</strong> Esper <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/23/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/esper-backs-kelly-00185125\">said</a> Trump \u201chas those inclinations\u201d towards fascism: \u201cI think it\u2019s something we should be wary about.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;Secretary of defense, 2019-20&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>James Mattis</h2>    <p><strong>What he did under Trump: </strong>As Trump\u2019s first defense secretary, Mattis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/20/jim-mattis-defense-secretary-retires-trump\">clashed with Trump</a> over the US\u2019s treatment of allies and its approach to \u201cmalign actors and strategic competitors\u201d across the world. He resigned in December 2018 a day after Trump announced the abrupt withdrawal of US troops from Syria. In 2020, Mattis publicly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\">condemned</a> Trump\u2019s handling of the racial justice protests, saying: \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What he says about Trump now:</strong> Mattis said Trump makes a \u201cmockery of our constitution\u201d.</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;Secretary of defense, 2017-19&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>John Bolton</h2>    <p><strong>What he did under Trump:</strong> Bolton served as national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019.

      "bodyText": "They range from top generals to reality stars to lawyers, but one thing all these people have in common: they have worked closely with Donald Trump and have gone public with their warnings on what they really think of him. John Kelly Chief of staff, 2017-19 What he did under Trump: A retired US Marine Corps general, Kelly served first as Trump\u2019s secretary of homeland security in 2017, then was appointed White House chief of staff, a role he held from July 2017 to January 2019. Kelly\u2019s departure from the White House followed reports of the general\u2019s declining relationship with Trump and alleged frequent disagreements. In 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump told an associate to \u201cstop calling John for anything\u201d. According to the veteran journalist Bob Woodward in his 2018 book Fear, Kelly called Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d and the head of a \u201cCrazytown\u201d administration. What he says now: Kelly recently said his former boss fitted \u201cinto the general definition of fascist\u201d who \u201ccertainly prefers the dictator approach to government\u201d. Mark Milley Chair of joint chiefs of staff, 2019-23 What he did under Trump: A retired US army general, Milley served as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under Trump and Joe Biden. Under Trump, Milley became the national focus in June 2020 when he participated in Trump\u2019s photo op at St John\u2019s church in Washington DC wearing military fatigues, amid ongoing demonstrations following the police murder of George Floyd. He publicly apologized for the appearance, saying: \u201cI should not have been there.\u201d Reports later emerged that Milley \u201cyelled\u201d at Trump and refused to be in charge of the federal response to the racial justice protests. What he says about Trump now: Milley has called Trump a \u201cfascist to the core\u201d and was doing \u201cgreat and irreparable harm\u201d. Mark Esper Secretary of defense, 2019-20 What he did under Trump: The politician and marketing executive served as defense secretary under Trump from July 2019 until November 2020, when Trump fired him with a tweet. During his tenure Esper repeatedly clashed with Trump, refusing to send \u201cmissiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs\u201d and to to deploy troops across the country amid the 2020 racial justice protests. Esper publicly opposed Trump\u2019s threat to levy the military against protesters using the 1807 Insurrection Act, telling journalists: \u201cThe option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used \u2026 in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations.\u201d What he says about Trump now: Esper said Trump \u201chas those inclinations\u201d towards fascism: \u201cI think it\u2019s something we should be wary about.\u201d James Mattis Secretary of defense, 2017-19 What he did under Trump: As Trump\u2019s first defense secretary, Mattis clashed with Trump over the US\u2019s treatment of allies and its approach to \u201cmalign actors and strategic competitors\u201d across the world. He resigned in December 2018 a day after Trump announced the abrupt withdrawal of US troops from Syria. In 2020, Mattis publicly condemned Trump\u2019s handling of the racial justice protests, saying: \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us.\u201d What he says about Trump now: Mattis said Trump makes a \u201cmockery of our constitution\u201d. John Bolton National security adviser, 2018-19 What he did under Trump: Bolton served as national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019. Trump reportedly began excluding him from meetings about the Afghanistan war, and eventually ousted him completely after Bolton attempted to stop Trump from inviting the Taliban to Camp David for peace talks (an idea Trump eventually scrapped). What he says about Trump now: Bolton has said Trump is \u201cunfit to be president\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t got the brains\u201d for a dictatorship. Rex Tillerson Secretary of state, 2017-2018 What he did under Trump: A former Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive, Tillerson served as secretary of state under Trump from February 2017 to March 2018, when Trump fired him with a tweet. During his time as secretary of state, reports emerged that Tillerson once called Trump a \u201cmoron\u201d, leading Trump to challenge him to an IQ test. The two men also publicly disagreed on US foreign policy surrounding North Korea, with Tillerson saying: \u201cWe do talk to them.\u201d In response, Trump tweeted that Tillerson was \u201cwasting his time\u201d trying to negotiate with Kim Jong Un. What he says about Trump now: Tillerson has called Trump \u201cpretty undisciplined \u2013 doesn\u2019t like to read, doesn\u2019t read briefing reports\u201d and added: \u201cHis understanding of global events [and] his understanding of US history was really limited.\u201d Omarosa Manigault Newman White House aide, 2017-2018 What she did under Trump: A former participant on The Apprentice, the TV show Trump hosted, Newman was hired as top aide for Trump in January 2017 until she was fired a year later by John Kelly. She later released secretly recorded White House conversations, including one in which Trump expressed his surprise at her being fired. What she says about Trump now: \u201cI fell for a conman \u2013 a conman who turned out to be the biggest fraud.\u201d Mike Pence Vice-president, 2017-2021 What he did under Trump: Pence served as Trump\u2019s vice-president and was his closest confidant for years. Following the January 6 Capitol Hill riots in 2021, a crowd of Trump supporters chanted \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d after Trump egged them on because he was angry Pence had refused to overturn the election results in Trump\u2019s favor by refusing to certify the vote (a power the vice-president does not even have). What he says about Trump now: \u201cAnyone who puts themselves over the constitution should never be president of the United States, and anyone who asks someone else to put them over the constitution should never be president again.\u201d Michael Cohen Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer What he did under Trump: Once Trump\u2019s attorney and fixer, Cohen had such a tight relationship with the billionaire real estate mogul that he once described himself as Trump\u2019s \u201cattack dog with a law license\u201d. Cohen later became the star witness in Trump\u2019s criminal trial over his hush-money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels, in which Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in an effort to interfere with the 2016 election. What he says about Trump now: \u201cA cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator and a conman.\u201d Cassidy Hutchinson Aide to Trump\u2019s chief of staff, 2020 What she did under Trump: A former aide to Trump\u2019s last chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Hutchinson became the focus of national attention in 2022 when she testified to the January 6 House investigative committee that Trump knowingly directed armed supporters to storm the Capitol. What she says about Trump now: \u201cAs an American, I was disgusted\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s role in the mob\u2019s attempt to overturn the election. \u201cIt was unpatriotic.

Describing her resignation to Politico in 2021, Griffin said: \u201cI made the decision to step down in December because I saw where this was heading, and I wasn\u2019t comfortable being a part of sharing this message to the public that the election results might go a different way.\u201d What she says about Trump now: She has called his messaging to women \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cinfantilizing\u201d, and predicted Trump is \u201cgoing to try to steal the election\u201d again.",

At the time, she told the Guardian, she and Epstein were walking through Manhattan when he suggested they visit Trump at his Trump Tower complex on Fifth Avenue.</p> <p>The two were good friends, she said. Trump later distanced himself from Epstein after the financier was convicted of being a sex offender in Florida, several years before he was arrested in New York on federal sex offenses in 2019 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/27/jeffrey-epstein-doj-watchdog-negligence-misconduct\">killed himself</a> while in custody awaiting trial.</p> <p>She added, as she did in her recounting to the Guardian, that she believed now that the incident was planned by Epstein and Trump all along. When they encountered Trump, she alleges he immediately grabbed and groped her, right in front of her boyfriend.</p> <p>\u201cThis context made no sense because the hands were on me and he and Jeffrey just kept talking and looking at each other and smiling,\u201d she said. Later, when thecouple left, she said Epstein berated her for allowing Trump to touch her, and that the whole incident left her confused and sick.</p> <p>\u201cI just had this really sickening feeling that it was coordinated, I was rolled in there like a piece of meat in some kind of weird twisted game,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI felt a wave of shame,\u201d she said, and took the memory of the incident, \u201cput it in a little box inside of me, turned the key, locked it.\u201d</p> <p>Williams told the Guardian this week in an exclusive first interview that she got the sense, at the time, that Trump and Epstein were \u201creally, really good friends\u201d. Williams also shared an undated postcard that she said Trump later sent her, with a view of Palm Beach, Florida, home to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago mansion.</p> <p>\u201cYour home away from home,\u201d the postcard read. \u201cLove, Donald\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-timeline\">Sexual misconduct allegations against Donald Trump \u2013 a timeline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s campaign, responding to CNN, said Williams\u2019s allegations were a \u201cfake story [that] was contrived by Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign,\u201d to distract from a second incident, in which Doug Emhoff is <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/24/us-news/second-gentleman-doug-emhoffs-ex-speaks-out-about-2012-assault-at-cannes-film-festival-i-saw-his-dark-side/\">accused of slapping</a> a former girlfriend.

Her account comes just weeks before the presidential election, in which Trump and the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, are essentially tied, according to polls. Trump has denied Williams\u2019s accounts. \u201cThe second he was in front of me, he pulled me into him and his hands were just on me and didn\u2019t come off,\u201d Williams told CNN, echoing her account to the Guardian. \u201cThen the hands started moving on the side of my breasts, on my hips, back down to my butt, back up, sort of \u2013 they were just on me the whole time, and I froze,\u201d she said. Williams briefly dated Epstein in the 1990s. At the time, she told the Guardian, she and Epstein were walking through Manhattan when he suggested they visit Trump at his Trump Tower complex on Fifth Avenue. The two were good friends, she said. Trump later distanced himself from Epstein after the financier was convicted of being a sex offender in Florida, several years before he was arrested in New York on federal sex offenses in 2019 and killed himself while in custody awaiting trial. She added, as she did in her recounting to the Guardian, that she believed now that the incident was planned by Epstein and Trump all along. When they encountered Trump, she alleges he immediately grabbed and groped her, right in front of her boyfriend. \u201cThis context made no sense because the hands were on me and he and Jeffrey just kept talking and looking at each other and smiling,\u201d she said. Later, when thecouple left, she said Epstein berated her for allowing Trump to touch her, and that the whole incident left her confused and sick. \u201cI just had this really sickening feeling that it was coordinated, I was rolled in there like a piece of meat in some kind of weird twisted game,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI felt a wave of shame,\u201d she said, and took the memory of the incident, \u201cput it in a little box inside of me, turned the key, locked it.\u201d Williams told the Guardian this week in an exclusive first interview that she got the sense, at the time, that Trump and Epstein were \u201creally, really good friends\u201d. Williams also shared an undated postcard that she said Trump later sent her, with a view of Palm Beach, Florida, home to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago mansion. \u201cYour home away from home,\u201d the postcard read. \u201cLove, Donald\u201d. Trump\u2019s campaign, responding to CNN, said Williams\u2019s allegations were a \u201cfake story [that] was contrived by Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign,\u201d to distract from a second incident, in which Doug Emhoff is accused of slapping a former girlfriend. A campaign spokesperson for Harris, the US vice-president, earlier this month denied the allegation against her husband. Williams\u2019s account will add to a long list of women who have accused Trump of sexual assault, ranging from the writer E Jean Carroll, who was eventually vindicated by a civil jury that found Trump liable for sexual abuse, to his ex-wife, Ivana Trump, who accused the former president of raping her, in a divorce deposition. Williams said she gained the courage to come forward about the incident following the release of a recent documentary about the magazine Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issues, called Beyond the Gaze. \u201cI can\u2019t control when a documentary comes out, I can\u2019t control its premiering two weeks before the election,\u201d Williams told CNN. Although Williams had alluded to the incident in social media comments, she had never told her story in detail until this week. \u201cIt takes a lot of guts, and you have to really prepare yourself for that onslaught, and I\u2019m ready now,\u201d she said. \u201cJust bring it.\u201d Information and support for anyone affected by sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

We are in a beer garden in Margate, Kent, where the band are recording four new songs. \u201cIt was a different time. People didn\u2019t talk about mental health.

But in another sense, they never really recovered. When Herlihy recounts his time in the band it reads like a series of stressful incidents. He remembers being about to go on stage at Glastonbury festival and realising the military jackets that the band always wore during performances had been locked in their tour van. Their tour manager had done a runner with their money and they had to smash the windows to get inside. He recalls guitar strings constantly breaking while recording Later \u2026 With Jools Holland, and Top of the Pops making them play live on unfamiliar instruments (\u201cWe were drunk \u2026 It was a disaster\u201d). There were temper tantrums and meltdowns whenever things went wrong. \u201cGod, I&nbsp;did not deal with that stuff well,\u201d he says. \u201cBut&nbsp;I was grieving, I was a kid \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have behaved like that, but it felt like it all mattered so much.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u00a0did not deal with that stuff well.

But when his wife pointed out the 20th anniversary date, and music industry friends expressed enthusiasm for a reunion, he reached out and found the band were keen to make it happen. Herlihy says he \u201cfelt like I was going to have a panic attack\u201d when he walked back into a rehearsal room. Then they staggered through some old songs and he realised the magic was still there. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite muscle memory but emotional memory,\u201d he says. \u201cYou suddenly feel the same things you felt then, even though you\u2019re 20 years older.\u201d Adding to this emotional wallop is the fact the producer of their new EP is Jolyon Thomas, son of the late Ken Thomas who produced The Lost Riots.</p> <p>Sonically similar to the grandeur of&nbsp;their debut album (one song even reaches the 12-minute mark), the new&nbsp;songs try to capture that original youthful passion when everything \u2013 especially music and film \u2013 felt vitally&nbsp;important.

They were great company and talked a&nbsp;good game. \u201cI think I was a cocky gobshite, really,\u201d laughs Herlihy. But&nbsp;they also seemed hyper aware of being outsiders in a scene that was spawning the more commercial likes of Franz Ferdinand and the Killers. How could they compete? Their live shows involved doomy video projections and their songs were inspired by Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Mogwai and Naomi Klein\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/11/no-logo-naomi-klein-20-years-on-interview\">No Logo</a>.

But we\u2019d be like: \u2018Wicked! Look at these things, they\u2019re cool!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Over time, the band drifted away from wild creative whims. Things became a slog, and they started to question why they were still doing it. When the band were offered the opportunity to record a third album, they declined. It was no longer fun. Partly, says Herlihy, because of the way they were treated by other bands following Lawrence\u2019s death. \u201cWe wanted to have drinks with them at&nbsp;festivals and hang out,\u201d he says. \u201cBut&nbsp;it was like we were damaged goods. Everyone\u2019s looking for you to&nbsp;be some kind of grief-stricken doomlord, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRL3MMcoqGY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nRL3MMcoqGY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The complexity of grief was starting to entangle the band. They were devastated, of course, but they also realised they were living out their dreams. \u201cIt was difficult to put across your best side because then I would feel a bit guilty. I felt like people expected me to just want to sit there and cry. The whole situation was messy and horrible.\u201d</p> <p>It was after the band had split that things caught up with Herlihy. For more than a decade he was haunted by comments from friends of Lawrence who had said that he was to blame \u2013 there seemed to be an implication that, as the leader of the band, he was the one responsible for Lawrence\u2019s welfare. \u201cI was the last person to see him and I was the one who found him,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you just think, oh, this <em>is</em> my fault.\u201d It was only when he eventually saw a therapist that he realised he was suffering from PTSD. He began work resolving the conflicting anger and guilt he still had around Lawrence\u2019s death. These days he remembers his friend from a much healthier perspective.</p> <p>\u201cI think about him now as a mate more than anything else. The way it happens is, \u2018Oh, he\u2019d have loved that television show\u2019, or \u2018I wish he could hear that album.\u2019 Because we weren\u2019t just in a band together \u2013 we got drunk together, we hung out and we talked about the Pogues. So yeah, it would be cool to have him on stage playing guitar with us, but that\u2019s not the main way I think about Jimmi.\u201d</p>    <p>Before reaching out to a therapist, Herlihy\u2019s life had taken a rather bleak&nbsp;turn. He had assumed he would&nbsp;just start a new band after Hope&nbsp;of the States and get another record deal. \u201cThen, when that didn\u2019t&nbsp;happen, I thought: \u2018Oh shit.\u2019\u201d He&nbsp;found a job in Starbucks, and still winces when remembering the encounters he had there.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe once every couple of weeks, you\u2019d hand somebody their coffee and they\u2019d do a double take. And I\u2019d be like: oh God, I know what\u2019s coming. They\u2019d have this sort of disappointment on their face and they\u2019d say: \u2018Aren\u2019t you Sam from \u2026\u2019 and I\u2019d say: \u2018Yeah, you know, bills to pay!\u2019 It was quite brutal. Looking back it\u2019s like: why the fuck didn\u2019t I just take an office job? My wife&nbsp;says I probably did it as some sort&nbsp;of self-flagellatory thing.\u201d</p> <p>Herlihy bounced back, though, opening the fine dining restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/23/pidgin-london-e8-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Pidgin</a> in Hackney, east London, along&nbsp;with a bunch of other eateries. Other members of the band also seem&nbsp;to have gone into various foodie&nbsp;jobs \u2013 from restaurants and microbreweries to natural wine bars in&nbsp;Copenhagen. Herlihy has three kids;&nbsp;his eldest is now around the age he was when his band first took off. He\u2019s thrilled that they will get a chance&nbsp;to see the band perform.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE_XATNbR1o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QE_XATNbR1o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>And this time if any strings break or&nbsp;amps blow up there will be no tantrums. \u201cHopefully not. I\u2019m a grown man now,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to do it unless it\u2019s joyful. The minute it isn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll leg it.\u201d</p> <p>These are the words of a happier, more stable Herlihy. So is he really ready to risk unleashing the band\u2019s curse again? After our interview ends,&nbsp;I stand to leave and realise that a&nbsp;bottle of water has leaked into my bag, soaking the contents, which includes a battery pack.</p> <p>Sam clocks it and, with a grin, imagines a future conversation he might be having. \u201cYeah, well we were&nbsp;all set to get this piece published in the Guardian \u2026 but the journalist electrocuted himself on the way home&nbsp;so it never happened.\u201d</p> <p>Well, if you\u2019re reading this then maybe the curse has been lifted.</p> <p><em>Hope of the States release Long Waits in&nbsp;A&amp;E </em><em>digitally </em><em>on 1 November.

He began work resolving the conflicting anger and guilt he still had around Lawrence\u2019s death. These days he remembers his friend from a much healthier perspective. \u201cI think about him now as a mate more than anything else. The way it happens is, \u2018Oh, he\u2019d have loved that television show\u2019, or \u2018I wish he could hear that album.\u2019 Because we weren\u2019t just in a band together \u2013 we got drunk together, we hung out and we talked about the Pogues. So yeah, it would be cool to have him on stage playing guitar with us, but that\u2019s not the main way I think about Jimmi.\u201d Before reaching out to a therapist, Herlihy\u2019s life had taken a rather bleak turn. He had assumed he would just start a new band after Hope of the States and get another record deal. \u201cThen, when that didn\u2019t happen, I thought: \u2018Oh shit.\u2019\u201d He found a job in Starbucks, and still winces when remembering the encounters he had there. \u201cMaybe once every couple of weeks, you\u2019d hand somebody their coffee and they\u2019d do a double take. And I\u2019d be like: oh God, I know what\u2019s coming. They\u2019d have this sort of disappointment on their face and they\u2019d say: \u2018Aren\u2019t you Sam from \u2026\u2019 and I\u2019d say: \u2018Yeah, you know, bills to pay!\u2019 It was quite brutal. Looking back it\u2019s like: why the fuck didn\u2019t I just take an office job? My wife says I probably did it as some sort of self-flagellatory thing.\u201d Herlihy bounced back, though, opening the fine dining restaurant Pidgin in Hackney, east London, along with a bunch of other eateries. Other members of the band also seem to have gone into various foodie jobs \u2013 from restaurants and microbreweries to natural wine bars in Copenhagen. Herlihy has three kids; his eldest is now around the age he was when his band first took off. He\u2019s thrilled that they will get a chance to see the band perform. And this time if any strings break or amps blow up there will be no tantrums. \u201cHopefully not. I\u2019m a grown man now,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to do it unless it\u2019s joyful. The minute it isn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll leg it.\u201d These are the words of a happier, more stable Herlihy. So is he really ready to risk unleashing the band\u2019s curse again? After our interview ends, I stand to leave and realise that a bottle of water has leaked into my bag, soaking the contents, which includes a battery pack. Sam clocks it and, with a grin, imagines a future conversation he might be having. \u201cYeah, well we were all set to get this piece published in the Guardian \u2026 but the journalist electrocuted himself on the way home so it never happened.\u201d Well, if you\u2019re reading this then maybe the curse has been lifted. Hope of the States release Long Waits in A&amp;E digitally on 1 November. The vinyl edition will be available as the band tour 4 to 7 December; tour starts Manchester.

That feels to us both incredibly exciting and drastically overdue.\u201d</p> <p>Rodr\u00edguez-Garavito said: \u201cFor some people, and definitely for some lawyers, this will feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable, because this challenges deep-rooted assumptions of western law and of ownership \u2013 of charity versus entitlement.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an experiment and an invitation. We undertake this project very much in the mode of inviting other artists, lawyers, creatives to think about the confines of property and authorship and take action along similar lines in their own professional niches.\u201d</p>",

A petition is to be submitted to Ecuador\u2019s copyright office to recognise the Los Cedros cloud forest as the co-creator of the composition Song of the Cedars. The action by the More Than Human Life (Moth) project is the first legal attempt to recognise an ecosystem\u2019s moral authorship of a work of art. The song contains melodies of echo-locating bats, howler monkeys, rustling leaves and even a subterranean recording of the soil taken from the spot where a new species of fungus was collected and described. It was composed by the musician Cosmo Sheldrake, writer Robert Macfarlane, field mycologist Giuliana Furci from the NGO Fungi Foundation and legal scholar C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez-Garavito during a field trip to Ecuador. The song was created when the group set up camp in the high forest during an expedition organised by Macfarlane as part of his research for Is a River Alive?, his new book about rivers and the rights of nature movement, which will be published in May 2025. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t written within the forest, it was written with the forest,\u201d said Macfarlane. \u201cThis was absolutely and inextricably an act of co-authorship with the set of processes and relations and beings that that forest and its rivers comprise.

The song, which will be available for free download, will be performed by Sheldrake at Cop16 on Tuesday at an event for the FFF Initiative, a collective effort to have fungi recognised on an equal footing as flora and fauna. Furci said: \u201cIt\u2019s fitting that the song will launch at this event, where we will be looking at new ways to measure, diagnose, treat and protect the living world, incorporating a kingdom of life that has never been recognised in those legal frameworks.\u201d Macfarlane said that philosophically, legally and culturally \u201cwe have neglected in all jurisdictions\u201d to recognise the creative co-authorship of the more-than-human world. \u201cSo much art, arguably all art, is made collaboratively with the living world, but the law doesn\u2019t recognise this. There\u2019s no example where a creature or plant, let alone a complex natural system like a forest and its rivers and beings, has been allowed moral authorship,\u201d he said. \u201cIf successful, this will be the first time in any jurisdiction that a more-than-human being \u2013 a river-forest in this case \u2013 has been recognised as a moral author in a work of art. That feels to us both incredibly exciting and drastically overdue.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez-Garavito said: \u201cFor some people, and definitely for some lawyers, this will feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable, because this challenges deep-rooted assumptions of western law and of ownership \u2013 of charity versus entitlement. \u201cThis is an experiment and an invitation. We undertake this project very much in the mode of inviting other artists, lawyers, creatives to think about the confines of property and authorship and take action along similar lines in their own professional niches.\u201d",

I was super-happy because I\u2019m back on the big stage and I want to go out there and show my skills.\u201d</p> <p>Last December, against Haney in San Francisco, the atmosphere was fraught and frenetic. During fight week a running verbal battle with the big-talking Bill Haney, Devin\u2019s father, often seemed to consume Prograis and he admits that he became distracted. \u201cOh, for sure. 100%. I knew we wanted to build the fight but they definitely got in my head.</p>    <p>\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t like Bill Haney. Sometimes he can be a clown but he\u2019s clever at the same time. It\u2019s interesting because boxing is much more mental than physical. We all train hard but your mentality makes the difference.</p> <p>\u201cPhysically I was good but, before the fight, it was a mess. It was like a big old party for everybody around me, like a celebration before the fight. I had my friends in my room, people filming, girls doing their hair. There was way too much going on and I didn\u2019t like it.</p> <p>\u201cManchester is so much better. When I\u2019m not working in the gym, I\u2019m just staying in my hotel room, reading and watching TV. So, honestly, I\u2019d rather fight away from home now. This is almost his home town [Catterall is from Chorley] and it\u2019s definitely his home country. But there\u2019s no pressure on me. I\u2019m just chilling. Nobody\u2019s calling my phone. I have nothing going on.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m getting back to my roots. When I was coming up through the ranks I would sit in my room all day before a fight. Last time I was in London [when he lost a narrow points decision in a compelling fight against Josh Taylor in October 2019] we did something every day. It was non-stop, being in the streets all the time, doing a bunch of media. It was too much and I learned from that. This time I work out in the morning and at night time but otherwise I\u2019m here [he gestures to his hotel room.]\u201d</p> <p>Prograis smiles when I ask if he feels bored. \u201cI\u2019m used to boredom. But they have a movie theatre three minutes\u2019 walk from here and on Sunday I saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/the-apprentice-review-cartoon-version-of-chump-in-chief-donald-trumps-early-years\">The Apprentice, the biopic about Donald Trump</a>. It\u2019s a terrible movie but it passed the time.\u201d</p> <p>The rest of that time is often occupied by thoughts of Catterall and, for all their friendliness, Prograis is almost dismissive of his opponent\u2019s credentials. In February 2022, in his finest performance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/26/josh-taylor-retains-titles-after-controversial-win-over-jack-catterall\">Catterall was robbed of his rightful victory</a> against Taylor. He knocked down the feisty Scot and dominated the fight but two of the three judges, somehow, gave the decision to Taylor. Catterall won the rematch this May but it was a much more difficult bout for him.</p>    <p>Prograis shrugs when I ask if he was impressed by Catterall. \u201cNot really. I feel he won the first fight \u2013 but the second was way closer. They kind of owed him the decision. But the Josh Taylor he fought was nothing like the guy I fought in 2019. I still thought I beat Taylor and if we have a rematch I\u2019d probably stop him.</p> <p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t know how hard this is going to be on Saturday night. Me and Taylor, we fought it out for 12 rounds. Jack doesn\u2019t have as much pushback as Taylor. He\u2019s more of a boxer but Jack is not so slick and, if I land, I\u2019m going to hurt him. Jack gets hit a lot and I know he\u2019s never dealt with nobody like me. And, listen, besides Taylor, there\u2019s nothing else on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. You take Taylor off my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, I\u2019m still a two-time world champion. It\u2019s all about levels in this game and I\u2019m levels above.\u201d</p> <p>Prograis is a voracious reader of boxing books and he understands the dangers of the ring more than most fighters.

My coach Bobby Benton is real calm and he tells me to \u2018Go have fun\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first heard that, it did something different to my brain. He was telling me to just enjoy myself. I realise that this is how we thought as kids. When I started out boxing at 16, 17, I did it to have fun.

      "body": "<p>Three journalists from the Hezbollah-affiliated TV stations Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on their press station in Hasbaya, southern Lebanon, early on Friday morning.</p> <p>The strikes hit a group of small chalets that 18 journalists from at least seven different media outlets \u2013 including Al Jazeera, Sky News Arabia and TRT \u2013 were staying in while covering the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon. Several cars with \u201cPress\u201d signs on them were parked in front of the site.</p> <p>Wissam Qassem, a camera operator with Al-Manar, and Al Mayadeen\u2019s Ghassan Najjar, a correspondent, and Mohammad Reda, a technician, were killed in the strike. Al-Manar is a Hezbollah media outlet and Al Mayadeen is a pro-Hezbollah outlet, but rights groups have said political affiliation does not make journalists a legitimate target. Journalists are considered civilians under international humanitarian law and deliberately targeting them is a war crime.</p> <p>The killings were condemned by Lebanon\u2019s minister of information, Ziad Makary, who called the attack a war crime. Israel has killed 12 journalists in Lebanon \u2013 six of whom were on duty \u2013 since fighting began on 8 October 2023, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/shelling-on-south-lebanon-border-kills-one-journalist-and-injures-six\">including the Reuters photographer Issam Abdallah</a>. Investigations by six international human rights organisations and media outlets <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/12/07/israel-strikes-journalists-lebanon-apparently-deliberate\">concluded</a> that Abdallah was killed by an Israeli tank in an \u201capparently deliberate\u201d strike.</p> <p>Friday\u2019s strike hit the group of journalists at about 3.30am local time (0130 BST). \u201cThe airstrike happened while we were sleeping. I don\u2019t remember hearing the sound of the explosion, I heard the sound of the rocket. I came out and found the chalet had fallen on the [journalists],\u201d said Darine El Helwe, a senior correspondent with Sky News Arabia who was present at the time of the strike.</p>    <p>The group of journalists had been using Hasbaya as a base for the past month, sleeping there and then going south during the day to cover the war. Hasbaya is not affiliated with Hezbollah and had largely been spared by Israeli strikes over the past year. The journalists relocated there after their previous residence in the south became unsafe due to intensifying Israeli bombing.</p> <p>El Helwe said the strike would probably have a chilling effect on journalists, many of whom had previously operated in south-east Lebanon under the assumption that it was safe from Israeli strikes.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIt was the only region that still would transmit pictures of airstrikes, targeting and skirmishes. I guess Israel doesn\u2019t want these pictures to come out any more. If they wanted to target a team from the journalists, they could have targeted them on the road because they know the cars. But to target us at night while we\u2019re sleeping?\u201d</p> <p>The strikes specifically hit the chalet in which the Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar journalists were residing. On Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike struck Al Mayadeen\u2019s office in the southern suburbs of Beirut, which had already been evacuated. Two of its journalists were killed a year earlier in an Israeli airstrike while reporting in south Lebanon.</p> <p>At least 125 journalists have been killed in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza over the past year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. On Wednesday Israel accused six journalists working for Al Jazeera in Gaza of being members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The network described the allegations as \u201cbaseless\u201d and called for the international community to intervene to protect the lives of the six journalists named by Israel.</p>",

The strikes hit a group of small chalets that 18 journalists from at least seven different media outlets \u2013 including Al Jazeera, Sky News Arabia and TRT \u2013 were staying in while covering the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon. Several cars with \u201cPress\u201d signs on them were parked in front of the site. Wissam Qassem, a camera operator with Al-Manar, and Al Mayadeen\u2019s Ghassan Najjar, a correspondent, and Mohammad Reda, a technician, were killed in the strike. Al-Manar is a Hezbollah media outlet and Al Mayadeen is a pro-Hezbollah outlet, but rights groups have said political affiliation does not make journalists a legitimate target. Journalists are considered civilians under international humanitarian law and deliberately targeting them is a war crime. The killings were condemned by Lebanon\u2019s minister of information, Ziad Makary, who called the attack a war crime. Israel has killed 12 journalists in Lebanon \u2013 six of whom were on duty \u2013 since fighting began on 8 October 2023, including the Reuters photographer Issam Abdallah. Investigations by six international human rights organisations and media outlets concluded that Abdallah was killed by an Israeli tank in an \u201capparently deliberate\u201d strike. Friday\u2019s strike hit the group of journalists at about 3.30am local time (0130 BST). \u201cThe airstrike happened while we were sleeping. I don\u2019t remember hearing the sound of the explosion, I heard the sound of the rocket. I came out and found the chalet had fallen on the [journalists],\u201d said Darine El Helwe, a senior correspondent with Sky News Arabia who was present at the time of the strike. The group of journalists had been using Hasbaya as a base for the past month, sleeping there and then going south during the day to cover the war. Hasbaya is not affiliated with Hezbollah and had largely been spared by Israeli strikes over the past year. The journalists relocated there after their previous residence in the south became unsafe due to intensifying Israeli bombing. El Helwe said the strike would probably have a chilling effect on journalists, many of whom had previously operated in south-east Lebanon under the assumption that it was safe from Israeli strikes. She said: \u201cIt was the only region that still would transmit pictures of airstrikes, targeting and skirmishes. I guess Israel doesn\u2019t want these pictures to come out any more. If they wanted to target a team from the journalists, they could have targeted them on the road because they know the cars. But to target us at night while we\u2019re sleeping?\u201d The strikes specifically hit the chalet in which the Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar journalists were residing. On Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike struck Al Mayadeen\u2019s office in the southern suburbs of Beirut, which had already been evacuated. Two of its journalists were killed a year earlier in an Israeli airstrike while reporting in south Lebanon. At least 125 journalists have been killed in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza over the past year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. On Wednesday Israel accused six journalists working for Al Jazeera in Gaza of being members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The network described the allegations as \u201cbaseless\u201d and called for the international community to intervene to protect the lives of the six journalists named by Israel.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us today, thanks for your company and correspondence. I\u2019ll be back in the early morning to bring you day three from Rawalpindi, it\u2019ll more than likely be the last day of the series no matter what happens. Don\u2019t miss it. Bye! What a day. England edged in front in the morning before Pakistan ground them down in the afternoon, recovering from 177 for 7 to end up with 344. A three wicket trick at the close puts the home side in a commanding position to take the series. Oh, and it\u2019s only the end of day two! This match has rattled along. Root and Brook will start in the morning with a deficit of 53 to chip off before Pakistan have to even think about chasing. Michael Atherton still has hope for England, do you? Andrew Hill poses the question\u2026 I don\u2019t have the brain capacity to crunch the numbers. You have to know your strengths and weaknesses in this life. \u201cAt 19/2, England need to score 102 more runs for their total runs in the second and third tests to equal their monster 823 declared from the first test. Have a test team ever scored more in one innings of a three+ match series than they have in the rest of their innings in that series?\u201d \u201cRuns after the fall of the sixth wicket so often determines the result of a Test match\u201d emails Gary Naylor. \u201cThey\u2019re usually the product of nous, belief and team spirit. England\u2019s tally of 149 yesterday looked good, but it\u2019s been eclipsed by Pakistan\u2019s 189 today, not something many saw coming I suspect. Credit, then, to the much-maligned Shan Masood and Jason Gillespie, who have put their side in the box seats for a memorable win and given fans of the format yet another example of its unpredictability and charm.\u201d Men all round the bat. Slip, leg slip and short leg breathing down Brook\u2019s neck after Root sweeps a single. Brook gets forward and smothers the spin, something Pope failed to do to Noman last over. Brook collects two runs through the leg side and steers a single past point. The Umpires are twitchy about the light, gloaming in Rawalpindi. In fact, they knock off the bails and lead the players off. England can\u2019t get out of there quick enough but the damage could already be done. 9th over: England 24-3 (Root 5, Brook 3) 8th over: England 20-2 (Root 3, Brook) That was the last ball of the over, here comes Harry Brook. England are clinging on here. They are probably done for already but they definitely can\u2019t afford to lose another this evening. Pope is out! Noman gets one to loop, drift and spin, the ball taking Pope\u2019s outside edge as he pokes out in front of his front pad, that\u2019s what does for him, the ball hitting the glove and plopping up to slip. The side on angle shows Pope was nowhere near the pitch of the ball, Noman\u2019 completely outwitting him with a change of pace. 7th over: England 19-2 (Pope 1, Root 3) Pope survives a probing examination from Sajid Khan. Maiden. Six dots. Deep breaths. 6th over: England 19-2 (Pope 1, Root 3) Joe Root joins Pope out in the middle, he\u2019ll feel like he owes his side some runs here after that misjudgement in the first innings. Crikey! Root nearly goes in exactly the same way again, playing back and asking to be pinned lbw but juuuust managing to jam the bat down in time! Be still my weary ticker. Pope pushes for one into the cover. Root is shuffling back and across again, clipping for two. Can\u2019t take your eyes of it, more importantly, neither can you, Joe. Crawley on toast! A skidder from Noman Ali thuds into Crawley\u2019s pad bang in front. There\u2019s no inside edge to save him and a review is burned trying to find one. England in trouble. Trouble Trouble Trouble. 5th over: England 15-1 (Crawley 2, Pope 0) The beleaguered Ollie Pope joins Crawley in the middle. You could cut the atmosphere with a rusty spoon. Pope survives the four remaining balls. Wicket maiden from Sajid. Brilliant bowling from Sajid who spears the first ball in and then follows up with a slower ball that loops and drops, beating Duckett on the inside edge and slamming into his pads. The umpire says not out but Pakistan are convinced! Rightly so \u2013 the DRS shows the ball was smacking into middle stump. Duckett has to go! 4th over: England 15-0 (Crawley 2, Duckett 12) A probing maiden from Noman Ali. Flight and guile. Feel the tension. 3rd over: England 15-0 (Crawley 2, Duckett 12) Sweep x 2! Sajid Khan back into the attack after one over from Saim Ayub. Ben Duckett drops to his knees and plays back to sweeps to get back to back fours! 2nd over: England 5-0 (Crawley 1, Duckett 3) Crawley stands tall and drives off the back foot for a single through cover. Duckett then gets out the sweep and picks up two runs to deep square leg. 1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 0, Duckett 0) Saim Ayub is opening the bowling, Shan Masood getting funky! Noman Ali and Sajid Khan absolutely livid no doubt. England\u2019s third innings gets underway with a Zak Crawley leg bye. Noman is going to bowl the second over, spindly shadows stretching over the outfield. This will be a real test for England. Here come Crawley and Duckett\u2026 buckle up. Bowled him with the googly! Rehan finishes with 4-66 and England drag their weary weary limbs from the field. The last few hours have been punishing for Stokes and his men, they now have a tricky hour to face with the bat before the close. They need to wipe off 77 runs before they can start to make their opponents sweat. 96th over: Pakistan 337-9 (Sajid Khan 41, Zahid Mahmood 0) Atkinson takes his metaphorical sweater after getting the breakthrough. Zahid Mahmood is the last man in, I dare say Sajid is going to open his shoulders here\u2026 The end of an epic innings! Atkinson gets the breakthrough with a short ball, Saud in two minds whether to pull or not and ends up plinking a simple catch to midwicket. What a knock, entered the fray at 46-3 and departs nearly a day later with a century to his name and having hauled his side to a lead of 70 runs on a tricky pitch. Well batted Saud Shakeel. Advantage Pakistan! 95th over: Pakistan 333-8 (Saud 131, Sajid Khan 39) Pakistan lead by 66 as three runs are pilfered off Jack Leach. Gus Atkinson is coming on to try and bust out a wicket for England. 94th over: Pakistan 330-8 (Saud 131, Sajid Khan 39) Things have calmed down after the pongoing of a few overs ago. Rehan gets through another over with two singles worked off it. 93rd over: Pakistan 328-8 (Saud 130, Sajid Khan 38) Leach continues, Saud and Sajid work the gaps and scamper runs, the lead stretches to 61. This partnership have added 63 runs in ten overs. Ben Stokes has his field spread, not a catcher in sight. It\u2019s not often you see that, England firmly on the defensive, trying to limit the damage. 92nd over: Pakistan 324-8 (Saud 127, Sajid Khan 36) Well bowled Rehan Ahmed, just a single off his latest over. England licking their wounds in Rawalpindi. Meanwhile\u2026 91st over: Pakistan 323-8 (Saud 127, Sajid Khan 36) What.A.Shot! Sajid plays an in-to-out lofted drive to a Jack Leach length ball and blasts over cover for a flat four. Bugle sounds. Stand and Deliver! Crank up Adam Ant. Pakistan lead by 56 runs 90th over: Pakistan 317-8 (Saud 126, Sajid Khan 31) Bashir is spared another by Stokes but England\u2019s captain chooses to thrust young Rehan Ahmed\u2019s feet to the fire instead. The leggie does well to get out of the over for just a couple. I\u2019m worn out, Pakistan\u2019s lead stretches past fifty, it\u2019s been high octane stuff post tea. 89th over: Pakistan 315-8 (Saud 125, Sajid Khan 30) Leach does well to keep a lid on things, just two runs off the over as Saud tells Sajid to take a breath and not try to hit every single ball. Twenty more minutes of this and England will be dead and buried. 88th over: Pakistan 313-8 (Saud 124, Sajid Khan 29) Sajid Khan is destroying his fellow off-spinner in Rawalpindi! Six runs clattered over Ben Duckett at mid on\u2026 and again SIX MORE. Bashir is wide eyed, the game and series on the line and he\u2019s being well and truly targeted. Four more! Sajid cuts a short ball away to the fence. Fantastic hitting, England are hurting here, NINETEEN runs off the over. The entire complexion of this match has shifted \u2013 Pakistan lead by 47 runs. 87th over: Pakistan 294-8 (Saud 123, Sajid Khan 11) More pain for England as Leach leaks thirteen runs off his over! Saud Shakeel gets in on the act and swipes through midwicket for four, that\u2019s his first boundary in 108 deliveries! 86th over: Pakistan 281-8 (Saud 113, Sajid Khan 9) Pakistan still have to bat last on this surface so runs in front will be crucial. That\u2019ll help! Sajid Khan smears Bashir down the ground for SIX. He can be dangerous with the bat and every run hurts England. More runs are scampered and eleven runs are collected off the over. 85th over: Pakistan 270-8 (Saud 110, Sajid Khan 1) Saud knocks Jack Leach\u2019s first ball post tea into the leg side for a couple to give Pakistan a lead on first innings. A single brings Sajid Khan on strike and he\u2019s content to pat back the rest of the over. Here come the players post tea. Scores level. Series on the line. What more could you possibly ask for this Autumnal Friday morning? Jeremy Boyce seems to be clamouring for Harry Brook to turn his arm over: \u201cIt seems to me this is a situation crying out for someone who can send down a few sets of head-scrambling concentration-testing Dermot Reeve-styled Dibbly-Dobblers, harnessing the unpredictability of the bowling to that of the pitch.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like to see Geoffrey traduced.\u201d Writes Peter Metcalfe. \u201cAt Headingley in the 1960s/70s it was quite a sight to see the great man shepherd the scores of autograph hunters into an orderly queue along the boundary before he stood there and started signing. Some signed twice over. And he signed all his books on the sales stand before they were even sold. I also treasure two appreciative letters from him, in blue Quink ink, from when he was outrageously dropped in 1967 for alleged slow scoring.\u201d The players head off for the tea interval without a single run to split them. 84th over: Pakistan 267-8 (Saud 107, Sajid Khan 1) Gone this time! England have toiled for the breakthrough and they get it right at the end of the session. Bashir gets the new ball to skid on and Noman plays across the line on the back foot, he knows he\u2019s done for as soon as he misses it. Brilliant knock though, helped haul his side up to parity. 83rd over: Pakistan 265-7 (Saud 106, Noman 45) Another big lbw appeal! From Leach this time but there was another big edge on it and umpire Sharfuddoula spotted it. So did England as they choose not to review. 82nd over: Pakistan 262-7 (Saud 105, Noman 44) Bashir back into the attack and goes up for a vociferous appeal to Noman Ali who misses with a sweep. Umpire Gaffaney not interested though and England opt not to review. DRS shows that it was clipping leg but would have stayed with Umpire\u2019s call. Another appeal next ball but a big inside edge saves Noman and they scamper a couple with the ball trickling off fine. 81st over: Pakistan 257-7 (Saud 105, Noman 41) New ball but same old. Leach is worked around for six runs off his returning over. England looking flatter than Michael Flatley driving across a fjord with four flat tyres and a broken stereo. Pakistan only trail by ten runs now. Will emails in with another amusing Boycott encounter: \u201cAt Trent Bridge in the early 1990s, my friend Ed and I joined a small group of autograph hunters approaching Boycott only to be loudly berated, \u201cNot now, I\u2019m having me loonch!\u201d. Still, I remember this much more vividly than the autographs we did get that day (sorry, RK Illingworth).\u201d 80th over: Pakistan 251-7 (Saud 104, Noman 38) Root rattles through his over, Saud flicks a couple then drives his 72nd single to keep the strike. The new ball is due and has been taken. Aptly, Jack \u2018The Nut\u2019 Leach is going to have first use of it. A clip into the leg side off Rehan Ahmed brings Saud a brilliant century. He raises his bat nonchalantly whilst Noman goes gangbusters with his celebration. Arms everywhere, lovely to see. Saud has kept his side in this match and could well tilt the scales in Pakistan\u2019s favour if he stays out there for another half an hour or so. England\u2019s lead is down to just 19 runs. 79th over: Pakistan 248-7 (Saud 101, Noman 38) 78th over: Pakistan 243-7 (Saud 98, Noman 36) Joe Root replaces Bashir and nearly gets a wicket first ball! Root gets one to spit off the wicket and take the shoulder of Noman\u2019s bat, the edge looping just out of reach of Stokes at slip. Noman works Root for a single but gets a ticking off for running down the middle of the wicket, that\u2019s his second warning. Naughty boy. 77th over: Pakistan 241-7 (Saud 97, Noman 35) Noman Ali sweeps Rehan hard to the square leg fence for four! Eeeesht! Nearly a run out next ball as Noman jabs to point and calls Saud for a run, Stokes swoops and peels off a fast and hard throw at the stumps, missing by a few inches. Noman would have been gone too. Stokes wipes his brow with his cap and allows himself a rueful grin. 76th over: Pakistan 235-7 (Saud 96, Noman 30) Saud cuts Bashir for two and then picks up a couple more with a clip off his legs. He goes to within one blow of a Test ton, he\u2019s only hit four boundaries all innings mind. This is Pakistan\u2019s highest partnership of the innings. 75th over: Pakistan 230-7 (Saud 91, Noman 30) Rehan flights a few, Saud and Noman nudge and nurdle, taking the runs on offer. 74th over: Pakistan 227-7 (Saud 89, Noman 29) The fifty partnership is up for Saud and Noman Ali. Pakistan very much in this game. England\u2019s lead down to 40 runs. Bubbling up in Rawalpindi as the incongruous tubthumps of Chumbawumba burst out of the stadium PA system (Tannoy is a brand name, you knew that though). \u201cHi Jim, given what\u2019s happening in Pune, have New Zealand fired up the patio heaters in Wellington? Has cricket changed forever?\" Jake \u2013 emailing from the classroom - this tour fits well with the teaching day\u201d Are you hiding in a store cupboard or brazenly emailing in in front of a classroom of kids? New Zealand going well in Pune, a first Test win on Indian soil on the cards\u2026 73rd over: Pakistan 225-7 (Saud 88, Noman 28) Noman Ali smears Rehan over mid on for SIX! Confident shot and more frustration for England. Well bowled \u2013 a good response from the young leggie who rips one on a length, he\u2019s been a bit too short in this brief spell. Time for a drink. 72nd over: Pakistan 215-7 (Saud 87, Noman 19) England burn a review as Bashir replaces Atkinson and Noman Ali tries to sweep a straight ball but connects only with fresh air. It looked outside the line on first glance and so it proved on DRS. England looking slightly frustrated by this partnership, wounding memories of Pakistan\u2019s wagging tail in the second Test at Multan creeping back into the noodle no doubt. The partnership between this pair is up to 39 runs in 14 overs. 71st over: Pakistan 211-7 (Saud 86, Noman 16) Rehan struggles to find his length and is easily worked around for five singles. Pakistan trail by 56 runs. \u201cOn the subject of meeting famous cricketers, I was at a Test match with my Dad at the Oval in the late 80s when I was about 10 years old. As we were heading down the stairs between overs to get a drink, a kindly looking West Indian gentleman was walking up the other way. He paused and looked at me smiling, presumably waiting for me to ask him for his autograph. Alas at that stage in my cricketing education I didn\u2019t recognise the greatest all rounder in history, so I smiled back and then edged round him and headed down the stairs. I only realised who he was when I saw his autobiography in the shop later that day.\u201d It\u2019s good to keep these guys on their toes, Tom Barnes. KLANG. I met Sobers a few years ago. Are you daft? Of course I asked him about Malcolm Nash: 70th over: Pakistan 206-7 (Saud 84, Noman 13) Atkinson stitches together a maiden, shaved scalp glistening with sweat under the afternoon sun. Hard yakka. Rehan Ahmed is being summoned, he was the star of the morning session. Can he prise another one out for England? He\u2019s got real chutzpah, watching him bowl is a joy. 69th over: Pakistan 206-7 (Saud 84, Noman 13) Five singles collected off Bashir with a minimum of fuss. England\u2019s lead being whittled away. Mark Lewis is indulging in a bit of chaos theory this Friday morning. \u201cMorning Jim, On meeting your heroes\u2026 In early summer of \u201805, a friend of mine was living in Cardiff. During a morning jog, he bumped into Simon Jones, who was running towards him, likely still recuperating from his latest injury. Spotting Jones, my friend mentioned a nasty pothole on his side of the road and warned him to be careful approaching it. \u201cWe need you fit for the First Test!\u201d he added. Jones missed the pothole, stayed fit, and the rest is history. My pal claims he basically won us the urn that year...\u201d Say thanks from me, Mark. Imagine a life without this \u2013 gudddunk! 68th over: Pakistan 201-7 (Saud 81, Noman 11) Thanks Rob and hello all. Engrossing Test cricket right here, Pakistan trail by 69 runs on first innings and Saud is well set. We could be in for a one innings shoot out to decide the series. Err yes please. Gus Atkinson slams a few into the guts of the pitch, England have gone to a short ball policy it seems \u2013 Pope is fielding very close in at silly cover. Lid firmly in place to protect his cherubic features. Noman rolls the wrists and collects a single to take Pakistan past 200. Right, that\u2019s it from me for today and indeed the series. Jim will be with you for the rest of the day. Thanks again for your company, emails, rants and riffs. See you for the West Indies white-ball games. 67th over: Pakistan 198-7 (Saud 78, Noman 10) Sharfuddoula made two howlers yesterday but that decision, though incorrect, was fair enough \u2013 it looked out in real time. Noman is not out! Indeed he did, a gossamer thin inside edge onto the pad. REVIEW! Noman given out LBW to Bashir It looked good, though the certainty with which Noman reviewed suggests he may have hit it. It\u2019s tea in Pune, where New Zealand are 85 for 2. Will Young fell to Ravichandran Ashwin for 25 but the captain Tom Latham is still there on 37. Their lead is 188. 66th over: Pakistan 197-7 (Saud 78, Noman 10) Saud takes a single off the first ball, almost with England\u2019s blessing as it means Atkinson has the chance to bowl five at Noman. The second zips past the edge; the rest are defended solidly. For a No9, Noman has an impressive technique and temperament. \u201cHaving finished reading the masterly tome The Art of Captaincy a few days previously, I bumped into Mike Brearley in the middle of Manchester,\u201d writes Ian Wild. \u201cHe accosted me with the words: \u2018Do you know where I can find the Piccadilly Hotel?\u2019 I said, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re Mike Brearley!\u2019 He said a little testily, \u2018Yes. Do you know the whereabouts of The Piccadilly Hotel?\u2019 I said \u2018No\u2019, and he walked on rather abruptly. Next time I was in Manchester, I saw we had been only a couple of hundred yards away from the massive Piccadilly. Still my hero.\u201d 65th over: Pakistan 196-7 (Saud 77, Noman 10) Saud threads Bashir nicely between the two men at short extra. Only a single but it was a classy shot from a player who has made a mockery of all the low scores. He\u2019s given only one chance, a really tough one to Jamie Smith on 20something. \u201cMay have shared this before but my first meeting with a hero stays with me,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cWaited in the foyer of the Hilton Hotel across from the MCG when I was nine in 1979. Ian Chappell, 53 not out overnight on his way to 75, came striding towards me. I held out my autograph book, but Chappell didn\u2019t break stride, just said to me \u2018F*** off mate, f*** off\u2019 and kept going. Never felt so grown up - Chappelli had called me mate and told me to f*** off!\u201d The innocence of a child. Had that happened at 29 it would have been terrifying. I had the chance of interview Chappelli in early 2013; it was only over the phone but I was still genuinely fearful. He couldn\u2019t have been nicer or more interesting. He even asked me if this new lad Joe Root was any good; for once I gave the right answer. 64th over: Pakistan 194-7 (Saud 76, Noman 9) Weird game, cricket. In the first two Tests England\u2019s second-choice spinner was their biggest threat and now the third choice is doing the job. Or rather he was. Gus Atkinson is on for Rehan Ahmed, who is possibly being saved for 10 and Jack. As Athers says on Sky, Noman Ali played Rehan well just before lunch; Rehan also looks more dangerous to the right-handers. Anyway, Atkinson to Noman, with one slip and a couple of men on the drive. An attempted bouncer from Atkinson doesn\u2019t get up at all and whooshes just past the tumps with Noman starting to take evasive action. \u201cYour mention of Boycott\u2019s ruthlessly efficient way of dealing with autograph hunters reminds me of the time I bumped into Brian Johnston at Lord\u2019s,\u201d begins Phil Withall. \u201cIt was at a village cup final sometime in the early nineties, he was barrelling along, greeting all and sundry with a happy wave and a pleasant nod. After signing my match ticket he ploughed on \u2018having places to be\u2019, yet it still felt meaningful. As if he really appreciated the request, the recognition. A truly unique and wonderful man.\u201d 63rd over: Pakistan 191-7 (Saud 75, Noman 8) Five singles form Bashir\u2019s over, although one ball almost sneaked through to hit Noman in front. \u201cWith the Test series likely to be concluded tomorrow, there are some very important questions for this England team,\u201d says Phil Russell. \u201cNamely \u2018Where is the nearest golf course?\u2019 and \u2018Can we get 18 holes in before it gets dark?\u2019 I presume that Jimmy Anderson will be tasked with sorting this out. Can\u2019t imagine he\u2019s got much to do as fast bowling coach beyond advising Atkinson to bowl at the stumps and wait for one to keep low.\u201d Haven\u2019t you heard? They\u2019ve made him the official reverse-sweep mentor. Right then, the players are back on the field in Rawalpindi. Shoaib Bashir will start, though I\u2019d have been tempted to give Gus Atkinson a couple of overs at Noman Ali. New Zealand are racing along in Pune. They\u2019re 78 for 1 after only 18 overs, a lead of 181. Like the man said. \u201cI remember as a 10-year-old at Hove in the late 1950s, I asked for Jim Parks\u2019 signature, and he shooed me away with \u2018not now, I\u2019m busy\u2019,\u201d writes Dr Roger Luther. \u201c It made a lasting impression, as you can see. \u201dOn the subject of Sussex wicketkeepers. in more recent years I used to take my dad, in his 90s, to a cafe in Rottingdean where we regularly met Rupert Webb and his lovely wife Babs. He was a great chap, very easy to talk to, now buried at the church in Rottingdean where Stanley Baldwin got married and Simon Cowell didn\u2019t (good quiz question!).\u201d Pune update New Zealand are 59 for 1, a lead of 162, with the tantalising chance of an historic series victory. I think it\u2019s a done deal, although I guess you never know with a team as great as India. \u201cOn the subject of \u2018You should never meet your heroes\u2019,\u201d begins Finbar Anslow. \u201cMy modest rebuttals would be Vic Marks (a polite handshake in the Oval car park) and Plaistow Patricia (sitting on the banks of a small river in the Piedmontese mountains).\u201d This reminds me of an amusing scene at The Oval in 2011. Geoffrey Boycott was signing a load of autographs, at which point some guy in his thirties started fawning over him: \u2018Geoffrey you were my dad\u2019s favourite player\u2019, etc, etc. The guy was mid-sentence when Boycott barked imperiously: \u2018Pen!\u2019 At least Geoffrey signed it to be fair. I\u2019ve heard a couple of stories of England greats telling kids where to stick their autograph book. Today\u2019s lunch break is a full hour to allow for Friday prayers, so play will resume at 9.30am BST. \u201cI find it fascinating that for all of the thrilling adventure of Bazball England still are unwilling to stick their head above the parapet and take a gamble on the excitement a legspinner can bring as their only spin option,\u201d says Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cInstead, we remain obsessed with the safety net that a finger spinner brings by holding an end up. Perhaps the final Rubicon that Morgan crossed with the ODI team through backing Rashid that allowed them to fully achieve greatness that McCullum and Stokes haven\u2019t yet taken. Show them what you\u2019re made of, Rehan.\u201d I might be wrong \u2013 it\u2019s hardly without precedent \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that. They fast-tracked Rehan when he was 18 and, don\u2019t forget, brought him into an Ashes squad as well. I suspect it\u2019s simply that they think Bashir (who is also an extremely brave selection) is a better bowler and, crucially, more likely to succeed in Australia. There\u2019s also a greater duty of care to young legspinners. England don\u2019t ask Bashir to hold an end up because they know he can\u2019t, not at this stage of his career; they also picked Moeen Ali as an attacking option when Leach was injured for the Ashes. (Even if, weirdly enough, the series turned on a very tight spell from Moeen at Headingley.) If England were playing it safe they\u2019d have picked Liam Dawson, whose form with bat and ball in the last few years is spectacular. England lead by 80 runs after another compelling session. They looked vulnerable at 151 for 4, only for the 20-year-old Rehan Ahmed to take three key wickets in a mischievous spell of legspin. Saud Shakeel is still there, having batted in a bubble to make a splendid 72 not out, so England aren\u2019t guaranteed a first-innings lead. But they\u2019d have taken this position at the start of play, and especially when Pakistan were 151 for 4. 62nd over: Pakistan 187-7 (Saud 71, Noman 6) Noman doesn\u2019t mind hitting out just before the interval. He blasts Rehan back over his head for an emphatic boundary \u2013 it almost went for six \u2013 and then turns the final ball of the session just short of leg slip. 61st over: Pakistan 182-7 (Saud 71, Noman 2) Saud trusts Noman, who made a vital 32 in the first innings at Multan, and is still batting in his bubble. He\u2019ll have to open his shoulders at some stage but it\u2019s never going to happen on the stroke of lunch. 60th over: Pakistan 179-7 (Saud 69, Noman 1) Rehan teases Noman with his variations: googly, legbreak, over and around the wicket. A late defensive stroke from Noman denies Rehan a plumb LBW; he has to settle for a second successive maiden. 58th over: Pakistan 179-7 (Saud 69, Noman 1) With the left-handed Noman in at No9, Stokes brings back Shoaib Bashir. A quiet over, two from it. In Pune, Mitchell Santner has taken 7 for 53 and India have been bowled out for 156. They trail New Zealand by 103 runs on a Bunsen and are facing an historic series defeat. 58th over: Pakistan 177-7 (Saud 68, Noman 0) A wicket maiden for Rehan, who has bowled a thrilling spell of 6-1-19-3. Rehan Ahmed has blown this game open. Aamer Jamal fiddled indecisively at a googly and deflected the ball back onto his stumps. He goes for 14 and England lead by 90 on a wearing pitch. Rehan whips through another over. Jamal is straining to get outside the line so that he can\u2019t be LBW even if he doesn\u2019t pick the googly. Bowled looks more likely \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened! 57th over: Pakistan 177-6 (Saud 68, Jamal 14) Jamal is beaten by Leach for the second time in as many overs. Pakistan are still picking up singles fairly easily but there isn\u2019t quite the same sense of permanance they had during the Saud/Rizwan partnership. 56th over: Pakistan 174-6 (Saud 67, Jamal 12) From nowhere Saud charges Rehan, has a filthy mow across the line and edges the ball over the head of Stokes at slip. A leading edge from Jamal runs through point for another single. Rehan could easily have dismissed all four batters he has bowled at today. 55th over: Pakistan 169-6 (Saud 63, Jamal 10) Jamal has started with intent. He rocks back to cuff Leach past mid-on for four, an unusual but beautifully played stroke. Leach hasn\u2019t been at his best today, though the next ball is spot on and goes past the outside edge. Meanwhile, in Pune\u2026 Mitchell Santner has taken six wickets and India, despite a typically defiant counter-attack from Ravindra Jadeja, are in the malodorous stuff like you would not believe: 142 for 9, still 117 runs behind. 54th over: Pakistan 164-6 (Saud 62, Jamal 6) A shortish delivery from Rehan is forced into the leg side for a couple by Jamal, who then hacks a single behind square on the leg side. \u201cLooks like the England selectors have struck gold by including Rehan Ahmed in the trio of spinners,\u201d says Colum Fordham. \u201cHe is clearly the X-factor - low action, brisk pace, sharply turning googly - that is unsettling the Pakistan batsmen who are more used to the slow left arm/offspin combination of Leach and Bashir. Great to see Rehan smile, encouraged by his captain, injecting the young leggie with confidence. Good on Stokes!\u201d 53rd over: Pakistan 159-6 (Saud 61, Jamal 3) Saud Shakeel is batting beautifully and doesn\u2019t need to come out of his bubble just yet, although he will if he\u2019s still at the crease when Pakistan are eight down. Three from Leach\u2019s over; for once he\u2019s the support act to Rehan Ahmed. 52nd over: Pakistan 156-6 (Saud 60, Jamal 1) Jamal inside-edges his first ball, another terrific googly, in the air but wide of short leg. Salman is out! A huge double breakthrough from Rehan Ahmed! Salman pushed defensively down the wrong line at a lovely delivery that straightened to hit him on the back thigh. Bounce isn\u2019t going to save him\u2026 and it\u2019s umpire\u2019s call on line! It\u2019s been reviewed and might be missing off, though my hunch is umpire\u2019s call. 51st over: Pakistan 152-5 (Saud 58, Salman 0) Leach replaces Bashir, presumably with the right-handed Salman in mind. He\u2019s been Pakistan\u2019s best batter in this series, averaging 87, but he looks a little nervous at the start of his innings. 50th over: Pakistan 151-5 (Saud 57, Salman 0) So close to another wicket! A beautiful googly from Rehan keeps low and is just kept out by the new batter Salman, who then gets a leading edge when trying to whip across the line. They\u2019ve got the wicket! A beaming Rehan Ahmed has struck with his ninth ball of the day. Rizwan reached out to sweep, missed and was hit on the back thigh. The LBW was given on the field and, though Rizwan reviewed, the ball would have hit off and middle a third of the way up. 49th over: Pakistan 149-4 (Saud 57, Rizwan 23) Rizwan pushes Bashir for a single to bring up an initiative-seizing fifty partnership in less than 13 overs. Time for drinks. England aren\u2019t in trouble but they do need a wicket. 48th over: Pakistan 147-4 (Saud 56, Rizwan 22) Now then, Rehan Ahmed is on for Gus Atkinson. You\u2019d imagine Rizwan will target him, although there\u2019s no real scope to do so during a decent first over. One wider delivery keeps a bit low and is steered for a single by Rizwan, one of three in the over. \u201cCrawley feels like one of those players who will always have a question mark handing over him in the minds of the public,\u201d says Will Vignoles. \u201cMight be wrong but I remember Ian Bell having the same issue until the 2013 Ashes. For Crawley, he was as you pointed out fantastic against Australia and India, has averaged 46 or so in the past 18 months, is part of what is statistically and on entertainment value England\u2019s best opening partnership since Andrew Strauss\u2019s retirement started this whole mess and yet people still want him gone. Duckett may have become the main man, particularly in the subcontinent, but there\u2019s a lot of value in Crawley still. Pope, less so sadly.\u201d One thing that helps Pope is that there\u2019s no obvious replacement at No3. If he was batting, say, No5 I think he\u2019d more vulnerable. 47th over: Pakistan 144-4 (Saud 54, Rizwan 21) 46th over: Pakistan 143-4 (Saud 53, Rizwan 21) There\u2019s no movement for Atkinson, and no prospect of reverse swing, so his biggest weapon is uneven bounce. I don\u2019t think any deliveries have really kept low today; maybe that\u2019s because the ball is a bit older. A series of gunbarrel-straight deliveries are repelled by Rizwan and there\u2019s one from the over. Atkinson\u2019s figures today are 4-0-10-0. He\u2019ll probably have one more. 45th over: Pakistan 142-4 (Saud 52, Rizwan 21) Saud sweeps Bashir firmly for four to bring up a terrific half-century from 92 balls. He was missed by Jamie Smith in the 20s but has otherwise played with an eyecatching assurance. In an ideal world Ben Stokes would save Rehan Ahmed for the tail but he may need to gamble soon because Pakistan are cruising along. This pair have added 40 in the last eight overs with few alarms. 44th over: Pakistan 135-4 (Saud 46, Rizwan 20) Atkinson continues to target the stumps in the hope that one will shoot through. Rizwan gets a thick inside edge that bounces safely on the leg side, then pushes Atkinson down the ground for a couple. He\u2019s playing superbly and is becoming a pain in England\u2019s hindquarters. \u201cAny sign of Joe Root warming up?\u201d asks Jeremy Boyce. Nope! \u201cGiven his rare failure with the bat yesterday I\u2019m sure he\u2019s itching to make up for the lapse. Actually, this seems to be the perfect occasion and pitch for some of Dermot Reeve\u2019s dibbly-dobbly mash up.\u201d 43rd over: Pakistan 133-4 (Saud 46, Rizwan 18) Bashir replaces Leach and is swept deftly for three by Saud; it should have been two but there was an overthrow after a poor return from Rehan. Three singles make it six from the over in total. Rizwan has put England under pressure and runs are starting to come more easily. 42nd over: Pakistan 127-4 (Saud 42, Rizwan 16) Rizwan continues his invaluable counter-attack by clipping Atkinson through midwicket for three. His busy positivity makes him a particularly dangerous player in low-scoring games. \u201cCan we bring in Foakes, bat Smith and drop Pope and Crawley,\u201d says Alisdair Gould. \u201cFoakes catches and offers variety of mind as a batsman. Smith is our current hero. Lance Pope and Crawley as the last act prior to the Ashes? The indulgence towards both must stop.\u201d In fairness, Crawley was England\u2019s best player against the two best teams in the world. I can\u2019t see him being dropped, especially as his game should be perfect for Australian conditions. Pope remains an interesting and slightly confusing case. Also, Lance Pope sounds like an erratic 6ft 8in left-arm quick from Tasmania. The Rizwan effect. Pakistan scored 26 in 12.2 overs before he arrived; they\u2019ve added 24 in 5.4 since then. 41st over: Pakistan 123-4 (Saud 41, Rizwan 13) Leach hasn\u2019t looked particularly threatening today and is swept decisively for four by Saud; a reminder that he was missed on by 27 by Jamie Smith, a tough chance standing up. 40th over: Pakistan 117-4 (Saud 36, Rizwan 12) Gus Atkinson comes into the attack, a logical move given how well these two batters play spin. When he offers a bit of width, Rizwan opens the face to glide the ball for four. Nicely done. He has changed the tempo of the innings already. 39th over: Pakistan 112-4 (Saud 35, Rizwan 8) Blimey. Out of nothing, after a series of exaggerated defensive strokes and leaves, Rizwan slog-sweeps Leach for six. So much for it being a high-risk shot; he absolutely nailed that. \u201cWhat is unfolding in Pune ( my home for 7 years) is even more tantalising than this game,\u201d writes Krishnamoorthy V. \u201cNew Zealand are to cricket what Roger Federer is to tennis and Armand Duplantis to pole vault. Loved by all, even opponents.\u201d It\u2019s a long morning session, two and a half hours, the players are taking the first drinks break. WICKET ELSEWHERE! India 103-7 (Ashwin LBW b Santner 4) Can\u2019t spake. 38th over: Pakistan 105-4 (Saud 34, Rizwan 2) Stokes must be really tempted to give Atkinson a couple of overs before Rizwan settles. He\u2019s much better against spin and had a torrid time against Brydon Carse in the first two Tests. Against that, the ball is doing plenty, particularly for Bashir. He beats Saud with another lovely delivery that dips and grips. Meanwhile\u2026 Watch: Bashir gets Shan with a beauty 37th over: Pakistan 102-4 (Saud 32, Rizwan 2) A reverse sweep from Saud is anticipated and then stopped by the diving Stokes, a terrific bit of fielding. One run can make the difference. Saud gets it past Stokes later in the over to bring up Pakistan\u2019s hundred. Rizwan plays a defensive stroke and then waves at the heavens, possibly because the drone camera was too close. He gets off the mark by sweeping Leach for two; England won\u2019t mind him playing that shot. \u201cDude,\u201d says Ben Bernards, \u201ccan you stop trying to jinx us (NZ) and prompt an Indian revival!?\u201d I\u2019m just here for the Freudian slips. Sounds like India have some awful shots today. 36th over: Pakistan 99-4 (Saud 32, Rizwan 0) The arrival of Mohammad Rizwan means a left/right-hand combination for Pakistan. You\u2019d expect him to be a lot busier and try to put pressure back on England. WICKET ELSEWHERE! India 95-6 (Sarfaraz c O\u2019Rourke b Santner 11) The scene of all scenes in Pune: India are still 164 behind, on a Bunsen, knowing defeat means a first home series loss in 12 years. Beautiful bowling from Shoaib Bashir! He\u2019s got Shan Masood exactly the same way as he did in the second innings in Multan, turning one sharply to take the edge as Shan closed the face. Pope, very close at gully, took a really sharp catch. There may be doubts over Pope\u2019s batting but by flip he is a brilliant close fielder. 35th over: Pakistan 99-3 (Shan 26, Saud 32) Leach has a couple of slightly better LBW shouts against Shakeel. Still not out though; it\u2019s going to be very difficult for him to get LBWs from over the wicket with the ball turning so much. \u201cAfter the women became World T20 champions on Sunday, New Zealand continues to amaze, Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cPopulation 5 million. I still get misty eyed thinking about the incredible dignity and generosity of spirit they showed after the most heartbreaking of defeats to England at Lord\u2019s in 2019.\u201d 34th over: Pakistan 99-3 (Shan 26, Saud 32) A low-risk single brings up an excellent fifty partnership comprised largely of low-risk singles. Five runs from Bashir\u2019s over, three singles and a two. England need\u2026 something. 33rd over: Pakistan 94-3 (Shan 23, Saud 30) There\u2019s an argument \u2013 there are quiet a few \u2013 that England cocked up real bad before lunch yesterday, and that if Pakistan bet sensibly, with a nice straight bat, they can eke out a decisive first-innings lead. Ach, who knows. The only certainty is that Pakistan are 173 runs behind. Freudian slip of the day 32nd over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan 22, Saud 29) Bashir makes it back-to-back maidens, and tjhough England haven\u2019t taken a wicket they do at least have control of the scoreboard: in nine overs this morning there have been only 19 runs. WICKET ELSEWHERE! India 83-5 (Pant b Phillips 18) Look, we can\u2019t ignore this. New Zealand could be heading for their first ever series victory in India, who are in all sorts on a pitch that is only going to get worse. 31st over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan 22, Saud 29) Leach, back over the wicket, has a hopeful LBW appeal against Shan turned down by the umpire Sharfudduola. He was outside the line and there might have been an inside edge as well. That aside, it was plumb. It\u2019s also an important day for Sharfudduola, who made a couple of strange howlers in the final session yesterday. Both were corrected by DRS but it\u2019ll surely be playing on his mind. 30th over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan 21, Saud 30) Bashir beats Shan with a near perfect delivery that pitches on middle and growls past the edge. He\u2019s been England\u2019s main threat in the first 25 minutes. Meanwhile, this is one of the reasons Gus Atkinson will be needed today. 29th over: Pakistan 90-3 (Shan 21, Saud 28) It didn\u2019t take Leach long to move around the wicket to the left-handers, an angle that has brought him quite a lot of joy in this series. But Pakistan are playing him well this morning, dealing exclusively in defensive strokes and low-risk singles. 28th over: Pakistan 87-3 (Shan 20, Saud 27) Saud has been dropped by Smith off Bashir. That could be a big moment. It was a tough chance, a big deflection from a leading edge, and it hit Smith on the shinpad. Risk and reward department: Ben Foakes couldn\u2019t have played that magnificent innings yesterday, but he would probably have taken that chance. Thanks to Russ Whedon for sending the TMS overseas link. \u201cThis series has definitely exceeded expectations measured on the Bazball \u2018entertainment first\u2019 scale, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d says Russ. It surely has. The evolution will be complete next winter when Stokes announces before the first Ashes Test that he couldn\u2019t give a stuff about entertaininment or saving Test cricket, he just want to bring the urn home. 27th over: Pakistan 82-3 (Shan 18, Saud 23) Erm, folks, something historic may be unfolding in Pune. New Zealand 259 India 72/4 (Jaiswal has just surrendered to Glenn Phillips\u2019 golden arm) 26th over: Pakistan 81-3 (Shan 18, Saud 22) Saud cuts Bashir very nicely for four. He\u2019s a real threat to England today, an outstanding player of spin, and I half expected Gus Atkinson to start at Leach\u2019s end because of that. Shan looks less comfortable against Bashir and edges short of Stokes at slip. He pushed with hard hands and the ball still landed well short. \u201cWhile waiting for play to start I\u2019ve been reading Walter Isaacson\u2019s marvellous biography of Steve Jobs,\u201d writes Kim Thonger. \u201cJobs had a habit of creating a reality distortion field around himself, in which he would bend truth just enough to win any argument. This strikes me as the same approach really good spin bowlers take. The batsman is never quite sure what\u2019s real and what\u2019s trickery. There is no mention yet of Jobs turning out for the Cupertino XI on Sundays, but maybe Walter is keeping it up his sleeve for the closing chapters.\u201d The old zootermeister, Shane Warne, was so good at that. There\u2019s a brilliant passage in Kevin Pietersen\u2019s book, On Cricket, about how Warne worked over both the batters and the umpires. 25th over: Pakistan 76-3 (Shan 18, Saud 17) The one advantage of batting second on a wearing pitch is that you can learn from the opposition\u2019s first innings. England lost five wickets before they twigged that the sweep is a high-risk shot on such a slow, low pitch, and since then the batters on both sides have generally played with a straight bat. Jack Leach\u2019s first over is a quiet, exploratory affair; two singles from it. 24th over: Pakistan 74-3 (Shan 17, Saud 16) A lovely start from Bashir, whose first ball curves onto middle stump and straightens sharply. Shan does pretty well to drop a thick edge just short of Pope, who is very close and under the helmet at gully. Shan gets another thick edge later in the over, this time all along the ground. He\u2019s definitely a candidate for an edge playing against the spin. The players are ready for action in Rawalpindi. In other news, Virat Kohli has just been bowled by a full toss and India are in a bit of bother against New Zealand in Pune. If New Zealand win the second Test they\u2019ll become the first team to win a series in India since England 12 years ago. Here, have you heard this? It might just be one of the greatest debut singles in the history of forever. \u201cAs you ease yourself into the new day, an interesting innings by Western Australia has just unfolded in the Australian one-day competition,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cSomehow they managed to lose eight wickets for one run, being bowled out for just 53. Spectacular achievement I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree...\u201d Amazing! I completely missed that. It reminds me a little bit of that astonishing Surrey collapse against Lancashire in 1993, which in some ways was even worse because they were so close to victory. Read Ali Martin on Adam Gilchr Jamie Smith Over the course of his sparkling 89 he once again showed the class and composure that marks him out as a player of considerable promise. Victim to a couple of rash yahoos in the second Test, Smith was content to first take a look, soaking up 32 balls for nine runs and playing chiefly with a straight bat. Unlike a couple of colleagues higher up, the 24-year-old appeared to trust his defence. Scorecard aficionados, this one\u2019s for you Read Simon Burnton\u2019s report on day one From the sport that once brought you leg theory, this was more like chaos theory. Before this week nobody knew what you would get if you spent the buildup to a game roasting the pitch in a makeshift fan oven. It turns out the answer is wickets, 13 of them falling on an opening day of drama and frequent befuddlement. This is the day, folks. By 1pm BST/5pm PKT we should have a strong idea who is going to win this intriguing series. For now it remains too close to call with any certainty. Pakistan will resume on 73 for 3, a deficit of 194 on a pitch that has had all the bounce and pace baked out of it. The case for England is that they have runs on the board on a pitch that could go at any moment; the case for Pakistan is that, in England\u2019s first innings, batting became less uncomfortable after around 35 overs as the ball started to age. Pakistan\u2019s innings is 23 overs old, which means only one thing: Big First Hour coming up. Really big.",

But my main job at the moment is just to get Alex fit and playing his best football, enjoying his best football and scoring goals.\u201d</p> <p>Howe remains determined to retain Isak but also knows that offering the 25-year-old a stratospheric new deal could prevent wider squad strengthening. \u201cAlex can only help his situation by playing well,\u201d said the manager. \u201cEvery decision we make has a knock-on effect. For contract renewals, there\u2019s a knock-on effect for PSR and we have to make sure we don\u2019t put ourselves in a position where we can\u2019t act freely in the transfer windows because of what we\u2019ve done with individual player contracts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s slightly complex. We have to be really careful regarding our spending. It\u2019s not a clearcut situation with Alex. We love him and are desperate for him to stay for many years and score loads and loads of goals, but I don\u2019t see a short-term issue with his contract.\u201d</p> <p>With Callum Wilson unavailable for the coming three games after experiencing \u201ctightness\u201d in his body following a recent recovery from back and hamstring injuries, Howe is heavily dependent on a striker he believes is largely without peer. By way of complication, Isak is still recovering from a broken toe. \u201cAlex\u2019s an outstanding talent, he can do everything,\u201d Howe added. \u201cHe\u2019s got incredible natural ability. Really good with the ball, really intelligent and a deadly goalscorer when he\u2019s at his absolute best.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be very hesitant to swap him for anybody in world football but we haven\u2019t quite seen that devastating, all round game so far this season. For me that\u2019s been down to a couple of niggling injuries that keep setting him back. But I think he\u2019s getting close to prime physical condition so this will be a big week for him.\u201d</p> <p>Howe acknowledges Newcastle need to also do their bit to keep Isak content. \u201cOne of the challenges we have is to continually drive the club forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to talk about ambition, but we have to show ambition. We have to give our best players an environment where they feel they\u2019re flourishing. We don\u2019t want to be disbanding our team every year.</p> <p>\u201cBut a player also has to perform to high levels. If he\u2019s saying he has huge ambitions, he has to be actually doing the business on the pitch - it\u2019s a two-way thing.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eddie Howe has suggested that Newcastle\u2019s hierarchy do not currently regard extending Alexander Isak\u2019s contract as a priority and is challenging the out-of-form Sweden striker to change directors\u2019 minds. Isak is widely coveted, with Arsenal particularly keen admirers, but with his present deal running until 2028 and Newcastle constrained by the need to remain on the right side of profit and sustainability regulations, there seems a reluctance to imminently improve an existing agreement that already places Isak among the club\u2019s highest earners. \u201cI want Alex to be focused on football,\u201d said Howe as he prepared for Sunday\u2019s trip to Chelsea at the start of a week also featuring a home midweek Carabao Cup tie against Enzo Maresca\u2019s side followed by the Premier League visit of Arsenal. \u201cIf that\u2019s him saying I\u2019ve got four years left on my contract, I\u2019m happy at the football club and I just want to play my best football, that\u2019s the ideal world. \u201cBut nothing in football\u2019s straightforward so I\u2019m sure there will be ongoing discussions between Alex, his representatives and the club. But my main job at the moment is just to get Alex fit and playing his best football, enjoying his best football and scoring goals.\u201d Howe remains determined to retain Isak but also knows that offering the 25-year-old a stratospheric new deal could prevent wider squad strengthening. \u201cAlex can only help his situation by playing well,\u201d said the manager. \u201cEvery decision we make has a knock-on effect. For contract renewals, there\u2019s a knock-on effect for PSR and we have to make sure we don\u2019t put ourselves in a position where we can\u2019t act freely in the transfer windows because of what we\u2019ve done with individual player contracts. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly complex. We have to be really careful regarding our spending. It\u2019s not a clearcut situation with Alex. We love him and are desperate for him to stay for many years and score loads and loads of goals, but I don\u2019t see a short-term issue with his contract.\u201d With Callum Wilson unavailable for the coming three games after experiencing \u201ctightness\u201d in his body following a recent recovery from back and hamstring injuries, Howe is heavily dependent on a striker he believes is largely without peer. By way of complication, Isak is still recovering from a broken toe. \u201cAlex\u2019s an outstanding talent, he can do everything,\u201d Howe added. \u201cHe\u2019s got incredible natural ability. Really good with the ball, really intelligent and a deadly goalscorer when he\u2019s at his absolute best. \u201cI\u2019d be very hesitant to swap him for anybody in world football but we haven\u2019t quite seen that devastating, all round game so far this season. For me that\u2019s been down to a couple of niggling injuries that keep setting him back. But I think he\u2019s getting close to prime physical condition so this will be a big week for him.\u201d Howe acknowledges Newcastle need to also do their bit to keep Isak content. \u201cOne of the challenges we have is to continually drive the club forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to talk about ambition, but we have to show ambition. We have to give our best players an environment where they feel they\u2019re flourishing. We don\u2019t want to be disbanding our team every year. \u201cBut a player also has to perform to high levels. If he\u2019s saying he has huge ambitions, he has to be actually doing the business on the pitch - it\u2019s a two-way thing.\u201d",

The South fears that North Korean involvement in the Ukraine conflict could have repercussions along their border, where tensions are already running high. On Friday, the South voiced \u201cgrave concern\u201d after Russia moved to ratify its defence treaty with North Korea, calling again on Moscow to stop its \u201cillegal cooperation\u201d with Pyongyang. A widening conflict Under its conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea has signed up to US-led sanctions against the Kremlin and provided humanitarian aid and non-lethal assistance to Ukraine. This week, media reports said the South was considering sending officials to Ukraine to offer intelligence on North Korean battlefield tactics and take part in interrogations of captured North Korean troops. While the South is a major arms exporter \u2013 the ninth biggest in the world with sales worth $14bn last year \u2013 it has a longstanding policy of not providing weapons to countries that are engaged in conflict. That includes Ukraine. But the deployment of North Korean troops is adding to pressure on Yoon to lift the restriction \u2013 a move that would have to overcome legal and political obstacles to become a reality. Yoon has warned that arming Ukrainian forces is an option, telling reporters this week that the country will \u201cnot sit idle\u201d while the North \u201cthreatens global security\u201d. \u201cWhile we have maintained our principle of not directly supplying lethal weapons, we can also review our stance more flexibly, depending on the level of North Korean military activities,\u201d he said. The appetite in Seoul for more robust support for Ukraine is growing, even if it raises the prospect of South Korean weapons being used to kill North Korean soldiers in a war taking place thousands of miles away. \u201cThe big question is whether Seoul will relax restrictions on direct military aid,\u201d said Euan Graham, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. \u201cHowever, this would require constitutional change in some cases, so is far from straightforward.\u201d Kim agreed to deploy his troops for \u201ccynical transactional purposes, rather than shared strategic interests\u201d, Graham added. \u201cNonetheless, this is a remarkable turn of events, given that even Ukraine\u2019s neighbour Belarus has stayed out of a direct combat role.\u201d Seven decades after their three-year conflict ended in a truce and the creation of the world\u2019s most heavily armed border, North and South Korea are fighting a proxy war in Europe, according to Ramon Pacheco Pardo, professor of international relations at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe South is already indirectly providing military assistance to Ukraine [by backfilling artillery shells it sells to Kyiv\u2019s allies that are then shipped to Ukraine] and the North is directly supplying Russia. \u201cAnd both the South and the North are gaining valuable information from the war. Were Seoul to directly transfer lethal weapons to Kyiv, this would only emphasise that the two Koreas are engaged in a proxy war.\u201d A closer relationship with Russia There are doubts over how effective North Korean soldiers would be in combat given their lack of battlefield experience. But frontline action in Ukraine would be a rare opportunity for Kim to gauge how members of his million-strong army deal with real warfare. Fighting in Ukraine would enable North Korea to test the abilities of both its soldiers and weapons, said Gabriel Jonsson, associate professor of Korean studies at Stockholm University. \u201cNorth Korea can also gain income and assistance to its missile and nuclear programmes from Russia,\u201d Jonsson said, adding that it would enable the North\u2019s propaganda machine to claim, however fancifully, that its military might is a match for that of the US. Kim\u2019s decision to so closely align himself with Putin will only boost the North\u2019s sanctions-busting nuclear weapons programme \u2013 and that is bad news for the South, where some have called for their country to develop its own nuclear weapons. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s forces only have one mission: to fight and die for Russia and make Kim Jong-un billions of dollars in the process, ensuring Pyongyang has more than enough cash to evade sanctions and never give up its nuclear weapons,\u201d said Harry Kazianis, senior director of national security affairs at the Center for the National Interest in Washington. \u201cThe reality is that the longer the war in Ukraine goes on, the more forces Putin will need from North Korea, only making the Kim family stronger by the day and filling the regime\u2019s bank accounts.\u201d",

Mariel Garza, the editorials editor who had resigned from the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday, told the New York Times that \u201cwhat he outlines in that tweet is not an endorsement, or even an editorial\u201d. Garza and Klein did not respond to requests for comment. The lack of transparency around Soon-Shiong\u2019s reasons for not allowing his paper to make a presidential endorsement has left journalists in the Los Angeles Times\u2019 newsroom frustrated and confused, and appears to have sparked an uprising among some of the paper\u2019s readers. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the paper saw a spike in readers cancelling their subscriptions to the paper, with a total of 1,793 citing \u201ceditorial content\u201d as the reason, a number that has circulated among current and former Los Angeles Times journalists. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Times did not respond to a request for comment on the uptick in cancellations. Asked by Spectrum News about his response to readers who were canceling their subscriptions, Soon-Shiong said, \u201cI hope that they understand by not subscribing, it just adds to the demise, frankly, of democracy and the fourth estate.\u201d On Thursday, leaders of the union that represents Los Angeles Times journalists posted a message on X pleading with readers not to unsubscribe from the paper. \u201cWe know many loyal readers are angry, upset or confused, and some are cancelling their subscriptions,\u201d the union leaders wrote. \u201cBefore you hit the \u2018cancel\u2019 button: That subscription underwrites the salaries of hundreds of journalists in our newsroom.\u201d The paper\u2019s own journalists were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Soon-Shiong\u2019s decision and \u201cpressing for answers\u201d, even as they continued to do their jobs reporting the news, the union leaders wrote. Later that afternoon, Mark Hamill, the Star Wars actor, tweeted to his 5m followers: \u201cI canceled our subscription to the LA Times because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with them being silent. In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is the only way to show I\u2019m standing up.\u201d Hamill tagged his tweet with the hashtag, #ThankYouMarielGarza, saluting the editorials page editor who had first resigned from the paper, and who made public the fact that Soon-Shiong had specifically blocked the editorial board from endorsing Harris.",

A lack of outdoor physical activity will disadvantage girls from a young age, and these gendered expectations harm boys, too, as <a href=\"https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/titles/ruth-whippman/boymum/9781529439120/\">Ruth Whippman</a>, author of the book BoyMum, tells me.</p> <p>\u201cThe flipside of the \u2018boys play outside more\u2019 phenomenon is that parents as a whole give boys less of the kind of quiet indoor-type attention that they give to girls,\u201d she says. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w18893\">Wide-scale research</a> across countries shows that from as early as nine months, parents spend more time with girls on activities such as learning letters and numbers, singing, drawing and telling stories.

Beaming when Desdemona arrives, it\u2019s hard to believe their love could falter. Thompson and Juliet Rylance played these same roles in New York in 2009; the now mature casting (also including Edward Hogg\u2019s ill-at-ease Cassio) would suggest cool heads who could easily resolve misunderstandings. These are no callow naifs \u2013 but that won\u2019t save them.</p>    <p>Will Keen\u2019s shaven-headed Iago is all gripe and snipe. His unassuming chat deflates people\u2019s confidence like a slow puncture. In his plain buff uniform, he sounds calmly uninflected, the only sign of agitation fingers thrumming at his scabbard. He quietly crows at the idea that Othello will never again know peace.</p> <p>The nastier Iago\u2019s words, the softer he speaks. Similarly, goaded into jealousy, Othello sounds more sorrowful as his thoughts turn violent: Thompson\u2019s \u201cI will tear her all to pieces\u201d is hollowed by distress. Carroll digs into characters who seem strangers to themselves \u2013 far later into the tragedy than you\u2019d think possible, he locates nuggets of teasing affection for Thompson and Rylance, moments when their connection might rekindle.</p> <p>Voices build in James Oxley\u2019s plangent a capella score and the Jacobean costumes are sombre from beards to boots. On Judith Bowden\u2019s set, a canister of tight threads descends to contain characters or create a thicket of their worst imaginings. Paule Constable\u2019s lighting brings the drama \u2013 glowering at the textured back wall or transfixing speakers in shafts of light. On this spare stage guilt has nowhere to hide, except in hearts and minds.</p> <p>Measured speaking illuminates characters such as Colin Hurley as Desdemona\u2019s garrulous and intemperate father. Anastasia Hille\u2019s troubled Emilia, worn down by Iago\u2019s jibes, moves through upset and into late courage. Unusually, Carroll doesn\u2019t shape Othello as a tragedy about race, and nor does he urge the pity of it. Rather, this production keeps a steady gaze on wavering humanity.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/othello/\">At Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 23 November</a></p>",

These are no callow naifs \u2013 but that won\u2019t save them. Will Keen\u2019s shaven-headed Iago is all gripe and snipe. His unassuming chat deflates people\u2019s confidence like a slow puncture. In his plain buff uniform, he sounds calmly uninflected, the only sign of agitation fingers thrumming at his scabbard. He quietly crows at the idea that Othello will never again know peace. The nastier Iago\u2019s words, the softer he speaks. Similarly, goaded into jealousy, Othello sounds more sorrowful as his thoughts turn violent: Thompson\u2019s \u201cI will tear her all to pieces\u201d is hollowed by distress. Carroll digs into characters who seem strangers to themselves \u2013 far later into the tragedy than you\u2019d think possible, he locates nuggets of teasing affection for Thompson and Rylance, moments when their connection might rekindle. Voices build in James Oxley\u2019s plangent a capella score and the Jacobean costumes are sombre from beards to boots. On Judith Bowden\u2019s set, a canister of tight threads descends to contain characters or create a thicket of their worst imaginings. Paule Constable\u2019s lighting brings the drama \u2013 glowering at the textured back wall or transfixing speakers in shafts of light. On this spare stage guilt has nowhere to hide, except in hearts and minds. Measured speaking illuminates characters such as Colin Hurley as Desdemona\u2019s garrulous and intemperate father. Anastasia Hille\u2019s troubled Emilia, worn down by Iago\u2019s jibes, moves through upset and into late courage. Unusually, Carroll doesn\u2019t shape Othello as a tragedy about race, and nor does he urge the pity of it. Rather, this production keeps a steady gaze on wavering humanity. \u2022 At Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 23 November",

      "body": "<p>It is a treacherous landscape, the set of Wolf Hall, which sits under grey clouds beside Wells Cathedral. Outside in the field, production vans spin their wheels and horses kick up mud. Inside, the Bishop\u2019s Palace is mined with cables, scaffold and lighting rigs. Visitors are advised to tread carefully. Danger lurks at every turn. \u201cYou watch yourself there,\u201d cautions Timothy Spall. \u201cYou won\u2019t lose your head, but you&nbsp;might lose your balance.\u201d</p> <p>For three months, Wolf Hall\u2019s cast and crew have shuttled between England\u2019s heritage sites. They\u2019ve shot at Hampton Court (where the planes were a nuisance) and Haddon Hall, Lacock Abbey and Montacute House. Now at last they\u2019re in the final straight. Cooling his heels in his trailer with a flask of hot tea, Spall explains that he has only one scene left to film \u2013 performing opposite lead player Mark Rylance inside the columned hall. Spall has been acting for decades. He knows his work back to front. \u201cBut you know what?\u201d he says. \u201cI still have the same sick feeling in my stomach. Every time I step out it\u2019s as though it\u2019s the first job again.\u201d</p> <p>If there still exists such a thing as prestige television in this age of un-curated, on-demand content, Wolf Hall fits the bill. The BBC\u2019s gilded Tudor drama is at once opulent and restrained, savage and soft-spoken; a gangster thriller in ermine and velvet, painted in shades of grey and occasional splashes of blood. The original <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/22/wolf-hall-review-slabs-of-guilt-lifted-triumphantly-from-the-bookshelf\">2015 series</a> covered the first two novels in Hilary Mantel\u2019s Booker prize-winning trilogy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/02/wolf-hall-hilary-mantel\">Wolf Hall</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/bring-up-the-bodies-hilary-mantel-review\">Bring Up the Bodies</a>), shadowing low-born, high-flying Thomas Cromwell through the court of King Henry VIII. The upcoming six-parter, written by Peter Straughan, tackles the third, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review-thomas-cromwell\">The Mirror&nbsp;and the Light</a>, in which Cromwell \u2013 nominally at the peak of his powers \u2013 finds himself friendless and under threat. No doubt that\u2019s the logic of every successful career: stick your head above the parapet and sooner or later someone will try to chop it off.</p>    <p>Spall has an hour to kill before he needs to get into costume and might as well spend it drinking tea in his trailer. Acting jobs, he says, are a bit like fishing trips. \u201cA lot of sitting around on the riverbank, then suddenly it happens and you\u2019ve got to pull in your fish.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s playing Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, one of the courtiers who perpetually circle the king. (The late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/may/06/bernard-hill-obituary\">Bernard Hill</a> played Norfolk in the first series.) History tells us that Howard was Cromwell\u2019s great nemesis, a player in his own right, though Spall prefers to think of the role as a small piece in a jigsaw. That\u2019s what film and TV actors are, he says: a set of moving pieces. \u201cThe job is about taking five pages of dialogue \u2013 and usually no more than two \u2013 and turning it into something that looks real, like it\u2019s happening and that fits with everything else. All that concentration on one little sliver that helps to make sense of the rest of the picture.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s basically it, that\u2019s acting for you. You stand there with your lines and try to make it sound like you are saying them for the very first time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/07/bookclub-hilary-mantel-wolf-hall\">Hilary Mantel: how I came to write Wolf Hall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wolf Hall\u2019s second series picks right up from the first, in the immediate aftermath of Anne Boleyn\u2019s execution, with Damian Lewis\u2019s tyrannical king demanding total fealty from his subjects. Off screen, nine torrid years have gone by. We\u2019ve had Brexit, Trump and Boris Johnson, war in Europe and a global pandemic. And if it\u2019s true that all futuristic sci-fi is a veiled commentary on modern times, then it\u2019s probably the case with historical fiction, too. It\u2019s unavoidable, Spall says. You don\u2019t work in a bubble. \u201cThe biggest thing we\u2019ve had these past nine years is a terrifying move away from democracy, or towards some sort of alternative to it. And this, Wolf Hall, is the biggest advert for democracy you can get, because what it shows in great detail is the system of rule inside a dictatorship. The volatile ego. The bloodline, the&nbsp;politics.&nbsp;That might be where we\u2019re all heading. So be careful what you wish for.\u201d</p> <p>In the chapel at the Bishop\u2019s Palace, the first scene of the day is under way. I take the pew beside director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/16/peter-kosminsky-i-thought-i-was-a-very-odd-choice-for-wolf-hall\">Peter Kosminsky</a> and watch as choirboys in white ruffs sing The Western Wynde Mass. Seated nearby, wearing Cromwell\u2019s black coat and cap, Rylance dips his head to speak to his costumed co-star; his voice pitched so low that the singing all but drowns it out. Ellie de Lange is playing the role of Jenneke. She is leaving for Antwerp and implores him to join her. By this point in the drama, Cromwell\u2019s position is precarious. His enemies are emboldened and the king has turned his back. Here is his off-ramp; a possible means of escape. One worries it might be the only chance he gets.</p>    <p>By both accident and design, Wolf Hall\u2019s closing stretch feels particularly death-haunted, with Cromwell\u2019s end somehow echoed by Mantel\u2019s sudden death in September 2022. Kosminsky, for one, is still processing the loss. The director became close to Mantel while shooting the first series. Their working relationship blossomed into a proper friendship. The author would send The Mirror and the Light to him as she was writing it \u2013 every couple of months, in 100-page instalments \u2013 and he would mail back queries and suggestions. Mantel was an invaluable resource on the first series, he says. He missed her on the second but felt that the bulk of the work had been done. \u201cBy the time we came to film I had no outstanding questions. Before she so sadly, unbearably died, we had already covered a lot of the ground. The only question I\u2019d like to ask her is the obvious one: what do you reckon to what we\u2019ve done?\u201d</p> <p>I suspect she\u2019d approve. It\u2019s a fabulous adaptation: a drama that continues the trilogy\u2019s stealthy line of travel; a tale of the past that implicitly speaks to the present. \u201cWell, we are all living through very turbulent times,\u201d says Kosminsky. \u201cSo was Hilary, albeit a little earlier. The world was darkening around when she was writing The Mirror and the Light, and we are all thoroughly benighted now.\u201d</p> <p>Outside factors might partially explain Wolf Hall\u2019s journey towards darkness. But the story itself has its own natural arc. \u201cThe first six episodes were about ascent,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were about Cromwell scrambling from a poor, ill-educated background to the top of the power structure. They had a mood of optimist chutzpah. This is the story of a descent. By its nature it\u2019s going to be much darker.\u201d</p> <p>Executive producer Colin Callender agrees. Nonetheless, he feels that amid all the talk of darkness, we shouldn\u2019t forget about the light. \u201cAt its core, it\u2019s about a man reflecting on his life,\u201d he says. \u201cCromwell\u2019s looking back \u2013 that\u2019s the mirror. But he\u2019s also looking forward \u2013 that\u2019s the light.\u201d</p>    <p>Self-reflection to illumination: that\u2019s the real narrative arc. \u201cSo of course it reflects the world we\u2019re living in now and the questions we all ask ourselves. How the hell did this happen? Did I do the right thing? What sort of world do we want this to be? But these are also the sort of questions we ask at various milestones in our lives. When we hit 40, 50, 60 or whatever. When we face our own mortality and look back on the journey. What could I have done better? What did I do wrong?\u201d Callender shrugs. \u201cI never asked Hilary why she called the book The Mirror and the Light, but that\u2019s what it means to me. And watching Cromwell ask those questions of himself is exhilarating.\u201d It is a descent, he says, but it is also a leap towards a kind of freedom.</p> <p>Back at the trailer, Spall has just about drained his flask. Soon, an assistant will escort him to the set. He\u2019ll be put into his costume, led before the cameras for his scene. The film set, it occurs, is the modern-day equivalent of the old Tudor court. It has a similar rigid hierarchy. It\u2019s defined by jockeying egos, pomp and pageantry, and by a boss on the&nbsp;throne who might at any second&nbsp;call \u201cCut\u201d.</p> <p>Actually, says Spall, it doesn\u2019t feel that way at all. \u201cYes, the director is in charge. But this is collaboration, not dictation. There\u2019s very little willy-waving going on and, contrary to popular belief, very few power games from people who are of a higher status than others. In Hollywood it\u2019s different. It\u2019s money, money, money. But you don\u2019t smell the money on something like this. You don\u2019t feel the studio breathing&nbsp;down your neck.\u201d</p> <p>In practice, he says, the working day sets the tone \u2013 and if there\u2019s anything breathing down your neck, it\u2019s time. There is a schedule to meet and scenes to be shot, and there are never quite enough hours in the day. Everyone is rushing to get Wolf Hall in the can. They\u2019re too busy, therefore, to plot, gossip or backstab.</p> <p>The process of film-making: that\u2019s the ultimate tyrant. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like?\u2019 Spall says. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to get an ostrich inside a Thermos flask. Films blow up and then implode. Think about it. The script for Wolf Hall is the size of a piece of A4. Then all of a sudden it\u2019s as big as all this.\u201d He waves his hand. \u201cWhat have we got today, about five acres here? Then the implosion is about pulling it all back so you can stick it on a TV screen that isn\u2019t much bigger than the original script. Or even smaller than that \u2013 a file on somebody\u2019s computer. That\u2019s the process of making pictures. It\u2019s remarkable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Spall hands over his flask. \u201cLook, here\u2019s your ostrich,\u201d he says. \u201cI do hope you enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p><em>Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light is coming soon to BBC One and iPlayer.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It is a treacherous landscape, the set of Wolf Hall, which sits under grey clouds beside Wells Cathedral. Outside in the field, production vans spin their wheels and horses kick up mud. Inside, the Bishop\u2019s Palace is mined with cables, scaffold and lighting rigs. Visitors are advised to tread carefully. Danger lurks at every turn. \u201cYou watch yourself there,\u201d cautions Timothy Spall. \u201cYou won\u2019t lose your head, but you might lose your balance.\u201d For three months, Wolf Hall\u2019s cast and crew have shuttled between England\u2019s heritage sites. They\u2019ve shot at Hampton Court (where the planes were a nuisance) and Haddon Hall, Lacock Abbey and Montacute House. Now at last they\u2019re in the final straight. Cooling his heels in his trailer with a flask of hot tea, Spall explains that he has only one scene left to film \u2013 performing opposite lead player Mark Rylance inside the columned hall. Spall has been acting for decades. He knows his work back to front. \u201cBut you know what?\u201d he says. \u201cI still have the same sick feeling in my stomach. Every time I step out it\u2019s as though it\u2019s the first job again.\u201d If there still exists such a thing as prestige television in this age of un-curated, on-demand content, Wolf Hall fits the bill. The BBC\u2019s gilded Tudor drama is at once opulent and restrained, savage and soft-spoken; a gangster thriller in ermine and velvet, painted in shades of grey and occasional splashes of blood. The original 2015 series covered the first two novels in Hilary Mantel\u2019s Booker prize-winning trilogy (Wolf Hall; Bring Up the Bodies), shadowing low-born, high-flying Thomas Cromwell through the court of King Henry VIII. The upcoming six-parter, written by Peter Straughan, tackles the third, The Mirror and the Light, in which Cromwell \u2013 nominally at the peak of his powers \u2013 finds himself friendless and under threat. No doubt that\u2019s the logic of every successful career: stick your head above the parapet and sooner or later someone will try to chop it off. Spall has an hour to kill before he needs to get into costume and might as well spend it drinking tea in his trailer. Acting jobs, he says, are a bit like fishing trips. \u201cA lot of sitting around on the riverbank, then suddenly it happens and you\u2019ve got to pull in your fish.\u201d He\u2019s playing Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, one of the courtiers who perpetually circle the king. (The late Bernard Hill played Norfolk in the first series.) History tells us that Howard was Cromwell\u2019s great nemesis, a player in his own right, though Spall prefers to think of the role as a small piece in a jigsaw. That\u2019s what film and TV actors are, he says: a set of moving pieces. \u201cThe job is about taking five pages of dialogue \u2013 and usually no more than two \u2013 and turning it into something that looks real, like it\u2019s happening and that fits with everything else. All that concentration on one little sliver that helps to make sense of the rest of the picture.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s basically it, that\u2019s acting for you. You stand there with your lines and try to make it sound like you are saying them for the very first time.\u201d Wolf Hall\u2019s second series picks right up from the first, in the immediate aftermath of Anne Boleyn\u2019s execution, with Damian Lewis\u2019s tyrannical king demanding total fealty from his subjects. Off screen, nine torrid years have gone by. We\u2019ve had Brexit, Trump and Boris Johnson, war in Europe and a global pandemic. And if it\u2019s true that all futuristic sci-fi is a veiled commentary on modern times, then it\u2019s probably the case with historical fiction, too. It\u2019s unavoidable, Spall says. You don\u2019t work in a bubble. \u201cThe biggest thing we\u2019ve had these past nine years is a terrifying move away from democracy, or towards some sort of alternative to it. And this, Wolf Hall, is the biggest advert for democracy you can get, because what it shows in great detail is the system of rule inside a dictatorship. The volatile ego. The bloodline, the politics. That might be where we\u2019re all heading. So be careful what you wish for.\u201d In the chapel at the Bishop\u2019s Palace, the first scene of the day is under way. I take the pew beside director Peter Kosminsky and watch as choirboys in white ruffs sing The Western Wynde Mass.

Keir Starmer said the freeports being announced next week would \u201chave this government\u2019s stamp on them\u201d despite being a policy inherited from the Tories. Starmer and Angela Rayner have identified planning reforms and devolution as ways to drive growth in parts of the country that have suffered underinvestment. Ministers are expected to announce changes to the freeports model, including improving oversight from local councils and mayors and aligning them with the government\u2019s industrial strategy. The prime minister\u2019s press secretary said the aim was to promote \u201cgrowth across the entire country\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s why so much of it is focused on our relationship with devolved administrations\u201d.

The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said that \u201cwhere necessary the government will make improvements to the freeport programme\u201d and that the employment rights bill would help safeguard workers\u2019 rights. Most existing freeports in England are close to major cargo ports such as Felixstowe and Southampton. The planned investment zone in the East Midlands will focus on hi-tech green industry. Rayner announced two other investment zones in her speech at Labour\u2019s party conference last month, one focused on advanced manufacturing in the West Midlands and one on life sciences in West Yorkshire. The government estimates investment zones in England have the potential to create 89,000 jobs by 2033 and attract \u00a311bn of private investment. Plans to establish investment zones at 12 sites were announced by the Conservatives in the 2023 budget.",

      "body": "<p>Beneath an intricate stained-glass window, I am sitting next to pastor Jeff Wilder, talking about lonely men. The clergyman is the first to say he looks a little different from your average Protestant preacher; his thick beard and arm tattoos might not instantly place him leading a flock here. But his assessment of the presidential race is insightful and nuanced \u2013 not least because his church is in Middletown, Ohio, where Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick JD Vance grew up.</p> \n<p>Middletown, a small city in the rust belt, was thrust into national prominence after Vance, by then a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist, published his memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/07/hillbilly-elegy-by-jd-vance-review\">Hillbilly Elegy</a>, in 2016. The book would pave the way for his move into politics.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1191b50f-6fa0-418c-ae36-fa655ac083d6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gQL_Bmsi8Bo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Vance is of course a polarising figure in this election, in part owing to misogynist comments targeting \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. But pastor Wilder takes exception to something else, too.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Republican party right now is doing a really wonderful job of faking relationships,\u201d he says. The emails he receives from the Trump campaign \u2013 which he signed up to for research purposes \u2013 often start with exuberant personal messages such as \u201cI need you\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t do it without you\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s ingenuine,\u201d Wilder says, recognising that some in his congregation \u2013 which splits about 50/50 on party lines \u2013 have \u201cfallen into the trap \u2026 Men\u2019s health is something we overlook in America. Men want to be part of something \u2013 to feel like they belong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Increasingly, this election looks set to be defined by an entrenched gender divide. This is particularly evident, according to recent polls, among white men without a college degree, who <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-fox-news-town-hall-women-voters-gender-gap-rcna175568\">favour Trump by a margin of 70%</a>. </p> \n<p>Naturally, what the pastor describes forms only a fragment of the reason white men are attracted to Trump. Some in the cable news commentariat chastise the Harris campaign for <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/andrea-mitchell-says-kamala-harris-has-big-problem-connecting-black-men-who-dont-take-her-seriously\">failing to connect with men</a>, overlooking the reality that swathes of them continue to carry so much gender and racial bias that connection is impossible. Throughout this election I have heard many voters describe the vice-president of the United States with vicious misogyny, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/21/trump-harris-dumb-stupid-low-iq/\">often in line with remarks Trump himself has made</a>.</p> \n<p>But America\u2019s lurch into a loneliness epidemic is long established. It\u2019s the subject of Robert Putnam\u2019s seminal work Bowling Alone<em>, </em>which is set in towns not too far from here and observes the decline of the civic organisations, from bowling leagues to trade unions, that buttress a strong democracy and social fabric. Last year Joe Biden\u2019s surgeon general categorised <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html\">loneliness as a public health crisis</a>. Vance acknowledges it in his book: loneliness, he writes, has led to \u201ca peculiar crisis of masculinity in which some of the very traits that our culture inculcates make it difficult to succeed in a changing world.\u201d</p> \n<p>After my visit to Wilder, I drive towards Ohio\u2019s border with Kentucky, along streets lined with large maple trees turning a magnificent orange as autumn sets in, for a canvassing event with a group of \u201cRising Republicans\u201d. They tell me (to my relief) that they define youth as between the ages of 18 and 40, meaning they can proudly declare that Vance himself could still belong.</p> \n<p>The gender divide that defines this election is even more pronounced among younger voters, according to recent polls. Some 67% of young women support Harris, compared with 28% who support Trump. And 58% of young men favour Trump, against 37% for Harris.</p> \n<p>Before we set out to walk the streets, I ask the group if they think the very definition of masculinity is on the ballot this year, too. Some nod in agreement. \u201cThe conservative\u2019s definition of masculinity is hard-working blue-collar man, who works hard to support his family, his wife, his livelihood, his home and his community,\u201d says one young man. \u201cThose on the left, I don\u2019t think they know what a man is.\u201d</p> \n<p>I ask the group\u2019s president, Grant Bagshaw, whether he has concerns about <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12\">the dozens of women</a> who have accused Trump of sexual assault, and of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db\">jury decision last year</a> to hold the former president liable for sexual abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable subject.

      "bodyText": "Beneath an intricate stained-glass window, I am sitting next to pastor Jeff Wilder, talking about lonely men. The clergyman is the first to say he looks a little different from your average Protestant preacher; his thick beard and arm tattoos might not instantly place him leading a flock here. But his assessment of the presidential race is insightful and nuanced \u2013 not least because his church is in Middletown, Ohio, where Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick JD Vance grew up. Middletown, a small city in the rust belt, was thrust into national prominence after Vance, by then a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist, published his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, in 2016. The book would pave the way for his move into politics. Vance is of course a polarising figure in this election, in part owing to misogynist comments targeting \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. But pastor Wilder takes exception to something else, too. \u201cThe Republican party right now is doing a really wonderful job of faking relationships,\u201d he says. The emails he receives from the Trump campaign \u2013 which he signed up to for research purposes \u2013 often start with exuberant personal messages such as \u201cI need you\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t do it without you\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s ingenuine,\u201d Wilder says, recognising that some in his congregation \u2013 which splits about 50/50 on party lines \u2013 have \u201cfallen into the trap \u2026 Men\u2019s health is something we overlook in America. Men want to be part of something \u2013 to feel like they belong.\u201d Increasingly, this election looks set to be defined by an entrenched gender divide. This is particularly evident, according to recent polls, among white men without a college degree, who favour Trump by a margin of 70%. Naturally, what the pastor describes forms only a fragment of the reason white men are attracted to Trump. Some in the cable news commentariat chastise the Harris campaign for failing to connect with men, overlooking the reality that swathes of them continue to carry so much gender and racial bias that connection is impossible. Throughout this election I have heard many voters describe the vice-president of the United States with vicious misogyny, often in line with remarks Trump himself has made. But America\u2019s lurch into a loneliness epidemic is long established. It\u2019s the subject of Robert Putnam\u2019s seminal work Bowling Alone, which is set in towns not too far from here and observes the decline of the civic organisations, from bowling leagues to trade unions, that buttress a strong democracy and social fabric. Last year Joe Biden\u2019s surgeon general categorised loneliness as a public health crisis. Vance acknowledges it in his book: loneliness, he writes, has led to \u201ca peculiar crisis of masculinity in which some of the very traits that our culture inculcates make it difficult to succeed in a changing world.\u201d After my visit to Wilder, I drive towards Ohio\u2019s border with Kentucky, along streets lined with large maple trees turning a magnificent orange as autumn sets in, for a canvassing event with a group of \u201cRising Republicans\u201d. They tell me (to my relief) that they define youth as between the ages of 18 and 40, meaning they can proudly declare that Vance himself could still belong. The gender divide that defines this election is even more pronounced among younger voters, according to recent polls. Some 67% of young women support Harris, compared with 28% who support Trump. And 58% of young men favour Trump, against 37% for Harris. Before we set out to walk the streets, I ask the group if they think the very definition of masculinity is on the ballot this year, too. Some nod in agreement. \u201cThe conservative\u2019s definition of masculinity is hard-working blue-collar man, who works hard to support his family, his wife, his livelihood, his home and his community,\u201d says one young man. \u201cThose on the left, I don\u2019t think they know what a man is.\u201d I ask the group\u2019s president, Grant Bagshaw, whether he has concerns about the dozens of women who have accused Trump of sexual assault, and of the jury decision last year to hold the former president liable for sexual abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable subject. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think any of us know, so I won\u2019t make a judgment on whether they are telling the truth or not,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cRepublicans and most Americans in general \u2026 they just don\u2019t believe the media most of the time.\u201d He has a point on the last part, but neglects to mention that distrust in legacy media has accelerated in the Trump era of misinformation. The Republican campaign this year has done much to engage with alternative rightwing media targeted at young men in particular, as a range of subcultures such as cryptocurrency and online gambling bend towards conservative values. A testament, perhaps, to how Americans are no longer just bowling alone, but posting alone. *** I head back to Middletown for some Friday Night Lights \u2013 a high school football match where the city\u2019s beloved \u201cMiddies\u201d are facing off against their arch-rivals Hamilton Big Blue, from the neighbouring town (the Middies get thumped 42-7). Given where we are, I\u2019m expecting to hear full-throated support for the Trump-Vance ticket and its turbocharged male identity politics. But the reality is perhaps surprising.

      "body": "<p>All of Kate Bush\u2019s sense of wonder, and how she tempers it with not just melancholy but outright sorrow, is threaded through her devastatingly moving new animated short film, Little Shrew.</p> <p>Bush hasn\u2019t performed live in a decade, or released new music since 2011 \u2013 and there\u2019s an initial twinge of disappointment on discovering that this film isn\u2019t built around a piece of new music. (In a BBC Radio 4 interview promoting it, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0jzv1s1\">she hinted</a> that she will begin writing new material again soon.) Instead, it\u2019s soundtracked by an edit of Snowflake, the opening song from that 2011 album 50 Words for Snow \u2013 a duet between Bush and her son Bertie.</p> <p>Bush has long wrung stunning material out of family dynamics. Cloudbusting is full of the boyish admiration sons have for their fathers long after we become men; This Woman\u2019s Work, about a crisis amid childbirth, is so stricken with awe at new life; Aerial was full of this material, from the maternal study of A Coral Room to a wonderfully guileless song about Bertie himself.</p> <p>Snowflake continues that tradition, as Bertie takes the form of a snowflake, whirling in the night, and Bush hopes to catch him: \u201cThe world is so loud / Keep falling / I\u2019ll find you.\u201d Once again it gets to the heart of parenthood: its bewilderment, and how desperate it makes us to shelter our children in the world\u2019s blizzard, snowblinded by love.

      "bodyText": "All of Kate Bush\u2019s sense of wonder, and how she tempers it with not just melancholy but outright sorrow, is threaded through her devastatingly moving new animated short film, Little Shrew. Bush hasn\u2019t performed live in a decade, or released new music since 2011 \u2013 and there\u2019s an initial twinge of disappointment on discovering that this film isn\u2019t built around a piece of new music. (In a BBC Radio 4 interview promoting it, she hinted that she will begin writing new material again soon.) Instead, it\u2019s soundtracked by an edit of Snowflake, the opening song from that 2011 album 50 Words for Snow \u2013 a duet between Bush and her son Bertie. Bush has long wrung stunning material out of family dynamics. Cloudbusting is full of the boyish admiration sons have for their fathers long after we become men; This Woman\u2019s Work, about a crisis amid childbirth, is so stricken with awe at new life; Aerial was full of this material, from the maternal study of A Coral Room to a wonderfully guileless song about Bertie himself. Snowflake continues that tradition, as Bertie takes the form of a snowflake, whirling in the night, and Bush hopes to catch him: \u201cThe world is so loud / Keep falling / I\u2019ll find you.\u201d Once again it gets to the heart of parenthood: its bewilderment, and how desperate it makes us to shelter our children in the world\u2019s blizzard, snowblinded by love. There is perhaps a hidden wisdom, too, unspoken in the song \u2013 if we grip our children too hard, they could melt away from us. It always felt bigger than Kate and Bertie, but Bush adds a terrifically powerful new dimension by making it, in Little Shrew, a lament for children affected by war, particularly in Ukraine (the film was made in collaboration with the charity War Child). As Bush says of Bertie in an accompanying essay: \u201cI think his performance is extremely moving and although I\u2019d originally written the song to capture his beautiful descant voice before he entered adolescence, it has taken on a haunting new meaning within the context of this animation.\u201d Bush writes and directs the film, storyboarded from her own sketches. These were drawn up by Jim Kay, the illustrator best known for Patrick Ness\u2019s A Monster Calls (which inspired Bush) and pictorial editions of the Harry Potter series, and then animated with the studio Inkubus. Little Shrew follows a Ukrainian pygmy shrew, captivated by a ball of cosmic light emanating from deep in the solar system. The creature scurries out of its cosy spot in the top pocket of a coat \u2013 and the animation coolly pans back to show that this is the corpse of a soldier sitting against a tree. The shrew makes its way through a war-torn landscape, and into the melee of Russian strikes, fired from under the chillingly blank face of an unmanned drone.

Lecanemab and donanemab, both monoclonal antibodies, prevent these clumps from building up.</p> <p>Some believe the decisions by Nice are far from the end of the road for these drugs. Prof Andrew Doig, of the University of Manchester, said: \u201cDonanemab has not been ruled out forever and this decision could change. We will continue to track how well it works over longer time periods. Costs may also come down.\u201d </p> <p>Other therapies are also on the way and could work even better than donanemab, Doig added.</p> <p>Dr Rich Oakley, the associate director of research and innovation at Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said one such drug is the monoclonal antibody remternetug. \u201cIt targets the same type of amyloid as donanemab but is hoped to be more effective, more practical and reduce the adverse effects seen with the other immunotherapy drugs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another drug causing interest is buntanetap \u2013 a small molecule that helps decrease production of the precursor to toxic amyloid. \u201cA recent trial has shown significant improvements in memory and thinking scores in people with early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease after 12 weeks of buntanetap treatment,\u201d said Oakley. \u201cImportantly, buntanetap treatment did not lead to any serious side effects.\u201d</p> <p>There is also valiltramiprosate, an oral drug that is being looked at for people with a gene that raises the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s.</p> <p>Prof Charles Marshall of Queen Mary University of London said another approach is to change the stage at which amyloid-lowering treatments are given, or the way they are administered, to make them more effective.</p> <p>He said: \u201cFor example, trontinemab is a new version of a previously trialled amyloid-lowering molecule that has been adapted to make it enter the brain more easily. This means it can have much greater effect on amyloid protein in the brain despite being given at a lower dose that may have less side effects.\u201d </p> <h2>Tau-lowering drugs</h2> <p>Buntanetap not only lowers levels of beta-amyloid but, as Oakley points out, it has also been found to reduce levels of tau in the blood. And it is not the only drug that affects this protein.</p> <p>Marshall also said <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2023/apr/first-gene-silencing-drug-alzheimers-disease-shows-promise\">BIIB080</a>, or MAPTRx, is causing enthusiasm. This works by \u201cswitching off\u201d the gene that gives rise to the tau protein. While still early days, experts are now hoping to explore whether the drug can slow the progression of physical symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.</p> <h2>Inflammation</h2> <p>Among the drugs causing a stir in this area are liraglutide and semaglutide \u2013 perhaps better known for their use in weight-loss jabs.</p> <p>There are several possible ways these drugs might help slow Alzheimer\u2019s, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/14/can-weight-loss-drug-such-as-ozempic-also-treat-addiction-and-dementia-semaglutide-cancer-diabetes\">by reducing levels of inflammation</a> in the brain. Early data <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/30/liraglutide-alzheimers-cognitive-decline#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20new%20research%20shows%20that,12%20months%2C%20compared%20to%20placebo.\">is promising</a>, with liraglutide found to reduce shrinkage in parts of the brain and slow cognitive decline.</p> <p>Several phase 3 clinical trials are under way to explore whether semaglutide has benefits for individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Yet with many drugs in development, and focusing on different targets, experts say the long-term goal is unlikely to involve a single type of treatment.</p> <p>Marshall said: \u201cIt is also possible that for amyloid-lowering treatments to be more effective, we need to give them alongside treatments that target other components of Alzheimer\u2019s disease such as tau protein or brain inflammation.\u201d</p>",

Both donanemab and lecanemab were approved by the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), yet the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said their benefits were too small to justify their costs, while there have also been concerns over potential side-effects \u2013 such as brain swelling and bleeding. For some, including Prof Rob Howard of University College London, the decision underscores the need to focus on ensuring people with Alzheimer\u2019s have access to diagnoses, therapy, social care and existing drugs that can help with symptoms of the disease. But while others agree such support is crucial, they are optimistic that disease-modifying drugs could play a role. According to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, about 130 drugs are under development, three-quarters of which aim to delay, slow or reverse the disease. \u201cThere are many promising treatments coming through the pipeline,\u201d said Prof Tara Spires-Jones, a neurodegeneration expert at the University of Edinburgh. Here we look at some of those treatments: Amyloid-beta targeting drugs Clumps of a sticky protein known as amyloid beta are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, causing disruption in cell communication, inflammation and cell death. Lecanemab and donanemab, both monoclonal antibodies, prevent these clumps from building up. Some believe the decisions by Nice are far from the end of the road for these drugs. Prof Andrew Doig, of the University of Manchester, said: \u201cDonanemab has not been ruled out forever and this decision could change. We will continue to track how well it works over longer time periods. Costs may also come down.\u201d Other therapies are also on the way and could work even better than donanemab, Doig added. Dr Rich Oakley, the associate director of research and innovation at Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said one such drug is the monoclonal antibody remternetug. \u201cIt targets the same type of amyloid as donanemab but is hoped to be more effective, more practical and reduce the adverse effects seen with the other immunotherapy drugs,\u201d he said. Another drug causing interest is buntanetap \u2013 a small molecule that helps decrease production of the precursor to toxic amyloid. \u201cA recent trial has shown significant improvements in memory and thinking scores in people with early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease after 12 weeks of buntanetap treatment,\u201d said Oakley. \u201cImportantly, buntanetap treatment did not lead to any serious side effects.\u201d There is also valiltramiprosate, an oral drug that is being looked at for people with a gene that raises the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. Prof Charles Marshall of Queen Mary University of London said another approach is to change the stage at which amyloid-lowering treatments are given, or the way they are administered, to make them more effective. He said: \u201cFor example, trontinemab is a new version of a previously trialled amyloid-lowering molecule that has been adapted to make it enter the brain more easily. This means it can have much greater effect on amyloid protein in the brain despite being given at a lower dose that may have less side effects.\u201d Tau-lowering drugs Buntanetap not only lowers levels of beta-amyloid but, as Oakley points out, it has also been found to reduce levels of tau in the blood. And it is not the only drug that affects this protein. Marshall also said BIIB080, or MAPTRx, is causing enthusiasm. This works by \u201cswitching off\u201d the gene that gives rise to the tau protein. While still early days, experts are now hoping to explore whether the drug can slow the progression of physical symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s. Inflammation Among the drugs causing a stir in this area are liraglutide and semaglutide \u2013 perhaps better known for their use in weight-loss jabs. There are several possible ways these drugs might help slow Alzheimer\u2019s, including by reducing levels of inflammation in the brain. Early data is promising, with liraglutide found to reduce shrinkage in parts of the brain and slow cognitive decline. Several phase 3 clinical trials are under way to explore whether semaglutide has benefits for individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Yet with many drugs in development, and focusing on different targets, experts say the long-term goal is unlikely to involve a single type of treatment. Marshall said: \u201cIt is also possible that for amyloid-lowering treatments to be more effective, we need to give them alongside treatments that target other components of Alzheimer\u2019s disease such as tau protein or brain inflammation.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>An elegant, old-school boozer with a restaurant on a corner just off Piccadilly has garnered such hectic <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/uk/food-drink/a61826917/the-devonshire-pub/#:~:text=Giles%20Coren%2C%20in,agape%20in%20wonder%E2%80%9D.)\">attention</a> over the past 12 months (its anniversary is on Bonfire Night next week) that it\u2019s quite hard to remember that this is just a pub. Yes, just a pub with Guinness, steak and chips, and sticky toffee pudding, rather than a magical, celeb-sprinkled fairy tale kingdom where the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran\">Ed Sheeran</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lewis-capaldi\">Lewis Capaldi</a> have been known to lead the nightly singing session in the back room, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/nigellalawson\">Nigella</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/margot-robbie\">Margot Robbie</a> tuck into chocolate mousse upstairs.</p> <p>In a short space of time, <a href=\"https://devonshiresoho.co.uk/\">the Devonshire</a> has already won several awards, been splashed across a thousand YouTube and TikTok channels, and caused foodies from all over Europe, Japan and North America to wage war over every spare table, which are as rare as hen\u2019s teeth. This is the number one place that friends tap me up for about tips on getting a table. Try midweek, I say, late, late afternoon \u2013 and pray that a Beckham or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bon-jovi\">Jon Bon Jovi</a> doesn\u2019t want your spot.</p>    <p>But it\u2019s the very fact that the Devonshire is indeed just a pub \u2013 albeit one that aims to do everything <em>very</em> well \u2013 that is the crux of its ongoing appeal. Landlord <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mcmoop/\">Ois\u00edn Rogers</a>, Charlie Carroll, founder of the <a href=\"https://flatironsteak.co.uk/\">Flat Iron chain</a>, and chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ashleypalmerwatts/\">Ashley Palmer-Watts</a>, ex of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/the-fat-duck\">the Fat Duck</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/12/dinner-heston-blumenthal-restaurant-review\">Dinner</a>, are not reinventing the art of hostelry; instead, they\u2019re leaning heavily on a yesteryear type of fun that wraps around punters like a comfort blanket. This is a pub that bakes its own sweet, plump bread rolls with glossy, salty tops and dispenses them around the tables before dinner. It\u2019s a pub with its own butcher, so the lamb cutlets and ribeyes are guaranteed to be of fine quality. It\u2019s a pub with a private room for lock-ins and muso gatherings, where filming on phones is banned, so you can literally have fun here as if no one\u2019s making \u201ccontent\u201d, a bit as you could in the 1990s. There are boho shades of Soho\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colony_Room_Club\">the Colony Room</a> in the modern-art-bedecked walls, while the dark main bar echoes <a href=\"https://www.coachandhorsessoho.pub/\">the Coach &amp; Horses on Greek Street</a>; there\u2019s also a touch of the 1980s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/16/can-the-groucho-ever-be-cool-again-not-if-money-is-all-that-matters\">Groucho Club</a> in the all-round ebullient mood, plus a large scoop of 1970s Kilburn in the often impromptu live Irish music. That said, the main bar is usually so packed with testosterone-fuelled, braying men in gilets, all necking Guinness like there\u2019s no tomorrow, that you may not wish to linger there long, or even at all.</p> <p>For too long, London\u2019s pubs have let down tourists with terrible pints, microwaved \u201ctraditional fish and chips\u201d and a general lack of warmth. The world flocks to Soho looking for the British pub experience they\u2019ve seen on TV, but instead what they get is a warm bottle of Rekorderlig blackcurrant in a prime bag-snatching spot off Shaftesbury Avenue, so they retreat to the All Bar One on Leicester Square. At the Devonshire, however, you can pop in for just a Guinness, or head to the grill room upstairs to feast on fat scallops with bacon doused with malt vinegar, or a whopping beef cheek suet pudding with a side of duck-fat chips (the grill itself at the far end of the room will definitely banish any winter chills).</p>    <p>The menu is intentionally straightforward: there\u2019s pea and ham soup, white crabmeat salad, lobster, langoustines and ribeye with a choice of sauces. On my last visit on a recent heaving Tuesday lunchtime, I had two of those glossy rolls smeared in salty butter, followed by the prawn and crayfish cocktail, which comes in a sundae glass brimming with marie-rose sauce and bedecked with a fearsome, shell-on crayfish that seems to watch you as you dine. Those big, buttery scallops are some of the best in London, and I\u2019m also a fan of the smoked salmon, though that\u2019s maybe because it\u2019s served with just-baked soda bread.</p> <p>The vegetarian option that day was a seasonal pumpkin risotto, and there was halibut fillet for the pescatarians, but I was with Charles, and he was determined to try the glorious beef chop, cooked medium-rare and sold in portions that began at 600g. It was a day for sides of pommes puree and creamed leeks, which our neighbouring table thought might contain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reblochon\">reblochon</a> \u2013 this is a convivial kind of place, and people tend to chat.</p>    <p>Lunch was the epitome of comfort food: hearty, buttery, and with peppercorn sauces and plates mopped with warm bread. The sticky toffee pudding, by the way, is actually rather refined \u2013 delicate and not claggy or overpowering \u2013 but the chocolate mousse is its evil little sister: rich, decadent and liable to put you to sleep by 3pm. The Devonshire didn\u2019t invent letting your hair down in Soho \u2013 that\u2019s been going on for centuries \u2013 but that fine tradition is at least being encouraged, protected and upheld.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://devonshiresoho.co.uk/\">The Devonshire</a></strong> 17 Denman Street, London W1 (no phone).

Yes, just a pub with Guinness, steak and chips, and sticky toffee pudding, rather than a magical, celeb-sprinkled fairy tale kingdom where the likes of Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi have been known to lead the nightly singing session in the back room, while Nigella and Margot Robbie tuck into chocolate mousse upstairs. In a short space of time, the Devonshire has already won several awards, been splashed across a thousand YouTube and TikTok channels, and caused foodies from all over Europe, Japan and North America to wage war over every spare table, which are as rare as hen\u2019s teeth. This is the number one place that friends tap me up for about tips on getting a table. Try midweek, I say, late, late afternoon \u2013 and pray that a Beckham or Jon Bon Jovi doesn\u2019t want your spot. But it\u2019s the very fact that the Devonshire is indeed just a pub \u2013 albeit one that aims to do everything very well \u2013 that is the crux of its ongoing appeal. Landlord Ois\u00edn Rogers, Charlie Carroll, founder of the Flat Iron chain, and chef Ashley Palmer-Watts, ex of the Fat Duck and Dinner, are not reinventing the art of hostelry; instead, they\u2019re leaning heavily on a yesteryear type of fun that wraps around punters like a comfort blanket. This is a pub that bakes its own sweet, plump bread rolls with glossy, salty tops and dispenses them around the tables before dinner. It\u2019s a pub with its own butcher, so the lamb cutlets and ribeyes are guaranteed to be of fine quality. It\u2019s a pub with a private room for lock-ins and muso gatherings, where filming on phones is banned, so you can literally have fun here as if no one\u2019s making \u201ccontent\u201d, a bit as you could in the 1990s. There are boho shades of Soho\u2019s the Colony Room in the modern-art-bedecked walls, while the dark main bar echoes the Coach &amp; Horses on Greek Street; there\u2019s also a touch of the 1980s Groucho Club in the all-round ebullient mood, plus a large scoop of 1970s Kilburn in the often impromptu live Irish music. That said, the main bar is usually so packed with testosterone-fuelled, braying men in gilets, all necking Guinness like there\u2019s no tomorrow, that you may not wish to linger there long, or even at all. For too long, London\u2019s pubs have let down tourists with terrible pints, microwaved \u201ctraditional fish and chips\u201d and a general lack of warmth. The world flocks to Soho looking for the British pub experience they\u2019ve seen on TV, but instead what they get is a warm bottle of Rekorderlig blackcurrant in a prime bag-snatching spot off Shaftesbury Avenue, so they retreat to the All Bar One on Leicester Square. At the Devonshire, however, you can pop in for just a Guinness, or head to the grill room upstairs to feast on fat scallops with bacon doused with malt vinegar, or a whopping beef cheek suet pudding with a side of duck-fat chips (the grill itself at the far end of the room will definitely banish any winter chills). The menu is intentionally straightforward: there\u2019s pea and ham soup, white crabmeat salad, lobster, langoustines and ribeye with a choice of sauces. On my last visit on a recent heaving Tuesday lunchtime, I had two of those glossy rolls smeared in salty butter, followed by the prawn and crayfish cocktail, which comes in a sundae glass brimming with marie-rose sauce and bedecked with a fearsome, shell-on crayfish that seems to watch you as you dine. Those big, buttery scallops are some of the best in London, and I\u2019m also a fan of the smoked salmon, though that\u2019s maybe because it\u2019s served with just-baked soda bread. The vegetarian option that day was a seasonal pumpkin risotto, and there was halibut fillet for the pescatarians, but I was with Charles, and he was determined to try the glorious beef chop, cooked medium-rare and sold in portions that began at 600g. It was a day for sides of pommes puree and creamed leeks, which our neighbouring table thought might contain reblochon \u2013 this is a convivial kind of place, and people tend to chat. Lunch was the epitome of comfort food: hearty, buttery, and with peppercorn sauces and plates mopped with warm bread. The sticky toffee pudding, by the way, is actually rather refined \u2013 delicate and not claggy or overpowering \u2013 but the chocolate mousse is its evil little sister: rich, decadent and liable to put you to sleep by 3pm. The Devonshire didn\u2019t invent letting your hair down in Soho \u2013 that\u2019s been going on for centuries \u2013 but that fine tradition is at least being encouraged, protected and upheld. The Devonshire 17 Denman Street, London W1 (no phone). Open all week, noon-10pm. From about \u00a340 a head for three courses \u00e0 la carte; set menu \u00a325 for two courses, \u00a329 for three, all plus drinks and service The next episode of Grace\u2019s Comfort Eating podcast is out on Tuesday 29 October \u2013 listen to it here",

Moyes still ended up leaving, Julen Lopetegui replacing him, and a major renovation of the squad was on the cards. Steidten, who had added his brother, Moritz, to a growing recruitment team, had it sorted. He was at Bayer Leverkusen before West Ham, leaving his role as chief scout in March 2023, and had also worked at Werder Bremen.

They went after a striker, which was a must given Michail Antonio and Danny Ings are the wrong side of 30. Lille\u2019s Jonathan David was targeted, only to prove too expensive, and so began a pursuit of Aston Villa\u2019s Jhon Dur\u00e1n.</p> <p>It was not to be, West Ham refusing to meet the asking price. Instead of pushing for the 20-year-old Colombian, who has scored seven goals this season, Steidten looked at the familiar Bundesliga market and signed the 31-year-old Niclas F\u00fcllkrug from Borussia&nbsp;Dortmund for \u00a327.5m. F\u00fcllkrug is yet to score, has no resale value, lacks pace and has been out since August with an achilles injury, meaning West Ham will still be reliant on Antonio when they host Manchester United on Sunday&nbsp;afternoon.</p>    <p>It is a ridiculous situation, rivalled only by the state of a cumbersome midfield. Is it news to West Ham that the Premier League is the most intense competition in the world? There were obvious shortcomings last season, with Tomas Soucek increasingly leaden, James Ward-Prowse (a Moyes pick) lacking dynamism and Edson \u00c1lvarez a yellow-card magnet after his arrival from Ajax, but nothing was done about it. Guido Rodr\u00edguez, a free transfer from Real Betis, had to be taken off during the first half of last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/21/west-ham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">3-0 defeat by Chelsea</a> and was overwhelmed alongside Soucek during last Saturday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/tottenham-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">humiliation at Tottenham</a>.</p> <p>Lopetegui\u2019s request for Rodr\u00edguez should have gone unheeded. There is plenty of blame to go around. The manager also pushed for Carlos Soler, who was in Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s reserves before arriving on loan, but it is yet to become evident why the Spaniard has been deemed a better fit than Ward-Prowse, who did at least offer goals and dangerous set-pieces before heading to Nottingham Forest.</p> <p>The mistakes are endless. Lopetegui had \u00c1lvarez man-marking the rapid Nicolas Jackson against Chelsea. Aaron Wan\u2011Bissaka, signed from United, has often been found anywhere but at right-back. Steidten spent \u00a325m on the potential of Luis Guilherme, an 18-year-old Brazilian winger, while glaring gaps remained unfilled. Buying Konstantinos Mavropanos from VfB Stuttgart for \u00a319m was a bad call.</p> <p>It is not a surprise that the Greece defender has lost his place to Jean-Clair Todibo, who has joined on an initial loan from Nice. Todibo is undoubtedly a talent. West Ham are still shipping goals at an alarming rate, though, and it is worth pointing out that the France international would have joined Juventus if they could have afforded him.</p> <p>This is not a happy club at the moment. There is no identity under Lopetegui and Mohammed Kudus lost his head to earn a red card against Spurs. Kudus is not in a good place. He had an angry exchange with Lopetegui after his half-time substitution against&nbsp;Brentford.</p> <p>Lopetegui will need Crysencio Summerville, who has been given few opportunities since joining from Leeds, to seize his opportunity in the absence of Kudus. This is a chance for the 22-year-old, one of the best attackers in the Championship last season, although others must also step up. Lopetegui, under growing pressure before a tricky run, is said to harbour concerns over his squad\u2019s attitude. Lucas Paquet\u00e1, who has been charged with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/17/lucas-paqueta-tells-lawyers-to-complain-to-fa-over-leaked-information\">a breach of betting regulations</a> (he denies wrongdoing), looks unfocused.</p> <p>So much has to change and the question is whether Lopetegui can inspire. There is alarm at board level. There is a sense that a buck-passing operation is under way. Steidten was involved in bringing Lopetegui to David Sullivan, West Ham\u2019s biggest shareholder, but it is interesting that reports in Germany have suggested the former Dortmund manager Edin Terzic is being lined up if results do not improve.</p> <p>While the strength of that link has been downplayed, it adds to the sense of instability. Steidten won his battle with Moyes. He has been backed and given power. Excuses run thin. After overseeing a spend of more than \u00a3100m, Steidten cannot have any complaints if questions are not only being asked about Lopetegui\u2019s job security.</p>",

Aaron Wan\u2011Bissaka, signed from United, has often been found anywhere but at right-back. Steidten spent \u00a325m on the potential of Luis Guilherme, an 18-year-old Brazilian winger, while glaring gaps remained unfilled. Buying Konstantinos Mavropanos from VfB Stuttgart for \u00a319m was a bad call. It is not a surprise that the Greece defender has lost his place to Jean-Clair Todibo, who has joined on an initial loan from Nice. Todibo is undoubtedly a talent. West Ham are still shipping goals at an alarming rate, though, and it is worth pointing out that the France international would have joined Juventus if they could have afforded him. This is not a happy club at the moment. There is no identity under Lopetegui and Mohammed Kudus lost his head to earn a red card against Spurs. Kudus is not in a good place. He had an angry exchange with Lopetegui after his half-time substitution against Brentford. Lopetegui will need Crysencio Summerville, who has been given few opportunities since joining from Leeds, to seize his opportunity in the absence of Kudus. This is a chance for the 22-year-old, one of the best attackers in the Championship last season, although others must also step up. Lopetegui, under growing pressure before a tricky run, is said to harbour concerns over his squad\u2019s attitude. Lucas Paquet\u00e1, who has been charged with a breach of betting regulations (he denies wrongdoing), looks unfocused. So much has to change and the question is whether Lopetegui can inspire. There is alarm at board level. There is a sense that a buck-passing operation is under way. Steidten was involved in bringing Lopetegui to David Sullivan, West Ham\u2019s biggest shareholder, but it is interesting that reports in Germany have suggested the former Dortmund manager Edin Terzic is being lined up if results do not improve. While the strength of that link has been downplayed, it adds to the sense of instability. Steidten won his battle with Moyes. He has been backed and given power. Excuses run thin. After overseeing a spend of more than \u00a3100m, Steidten cannot have any complaints if questions are not only being asked about Lopetegui\u2019s job security.",

      "body": "<p>An East Anglian man who lost his home to coastal erosion has lost his high court challenge against the government\u2019s climate adaptation plans.</p> <p>Kevin Jordan was one of three claimants who argued the government\u2019s plans for adapting to the existing and predicted impacts of climate change, known as the National Adaptation Programme 3 (NAP3), were insufficient and unlawful.</p> <p>A judge at the Royal Courts of Justice in London denied their claim on Friday.</p> <p>Will Rundle, the head of legal at Friends of the Earth, a co-claimant in the case, said: \u201cFriends of the Earth\u2019s legal team will study the detail of this judgment before we decide whether to lodge an appeal. Regardless of this judgment the national adaptation programme is hopelessly inadequate and is failing us all.</p> <p>\u201cA robust and comprehensive adaptation plan is urgently needed to help protect us from increasingly severe storms, floods and heatwaves \u2013 particularly marginalised groups, such as older and disabled people, and those living in areas most at risk from climate change.\u201d</p> <p>The judgment followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/23/uk-government-climate-crisis-protect-people-legal-claim-court\">a hearing at the court three months ago</a> in which Jordan and a third co-claimant, Doug Paulley, argued that each had suffered harm as a result of climate breakdown.</p> <p>Paulley, a disability rights activist, has a number of health conditions that are aggravated by the high temperatures of intensifying summer heatwaves caused by the climate crisis.</p> <p>Jordan, who is also disabled, lost his home in Hemsby, Norfolk, shortly before last Christmas, when authorities ruled it must be demolished because it was in danger of falling into the North Sea.</p> <p>The two men alleged that NAP3 was so deficient that it breached their human rights to life, home and possessions, and that they had been discriminated against on account of their vulnerable situations.</p> <p>Their lawyer, David Wolfe KC, had said their cases were representative of \u201cthe situation that other people will be in\u201d, and that rather than setting \u201ca generic aim simply to reduce risks\u201d for such groups, ministers had to set outcomes to address specific risks.</p> <p>They had called for a new, robust and comprehensive adaptation programme that better protects people and communities from the challenges arising from global heating.</p> <p>Responding to the verdict, Jordan said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThis is an extremely disappointing judgment. Without a tougher set of government policies to protect us, more people will face the horror of seeing their homes, lives and livelihoods threatened by the growing impacts of our rapidly changing climate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that communities like mine have already lost so much through the lack of foresight and planning for the foreseeable effects of climate breakdown. I don\u2019t want anyone else to endure what we\u2019ve been through. But many undoubtedly will unless the government strengthens its adaptation plans.\u201d</p> <p>Paulley said: \u201cClimate breakdown threatens us all, but disabled people are disproportionally affected and are always among those who bear the brunt when disaster strikes. The lack of adequate protection in the government\u2019s climate adaptation plan means more disabled people will suffer and die as the impacts of climate change accelerate.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "An East Anglian man who lost his home to coastal erosion has lost his high court challenge against the government\u2019s climate adaptation plans. Kevin Jordan was one of three claimants who argued the government\u2019s plans for adapting to the existing and predicted impacts of climate change, known as the National Adaptation Programme 3 (NAP3), were insufficient and unlawful. A judge at the Royal Courts of Justice in London denied their claim on Friday. Will Rundle, the head of legal at Friends of the Earth, a co-claimant in the case, said: \u201cFriends of the Earth\u2019s legal team will study the detail of this judgment before we decide whether to lodge an appeal. Regardless of this judgment the national adaptation programme is hopelessly inadequate and is failing us all. \u201cA robust and comprehensive adaptation plan is urgently needed to help protect us from increasingly severe storms, floods and heatwaves \u2013 particularly marginalised groups, such as older and disabled people, and those living in areas most at risk from climate change.\u201d The judgment followed a hearing at the court three months ago in which Jordan and a third co-claimant, Doug Paulley, argued that each had suffered harm as a result of climate breakdown. Paulley, a disability rights activist, has a number of health conditions that are aggravated by the high temperatures of intensifying summer heatwaves caused by the climate crisis. Jordan, who is also disabled, lost his home in Hemsby, Norfolk, shortly before last Christmas, when authorities ruled it must be demolished because it was in danger of falling into the North Sea. The two men alleged that NAP3 was so deficient that it breached their human rights to life, home and possessions, and that they had been discriminated against on account of their vulnerable situations. Their lawyer, David Wolfe KC, had said their cases were representative of \u201cthe situation that other people will be in\u201d, and that rather than setting \u201ca generic aim simply to reduce risks\u201d for such groups, ministers had to set outcomes to address specific risks. They had called for a new, robust and comprehensive adaptation programme that better protects people and communities from the challenges arising from global heating. Responding to the verdict, Jordan said: \u201cThis is an extremely disappointing judgment. Without a tougher set of government policies to protect us, more people will face the horror of seeing their homes, lives and livelihoods threatened by the growing impacts of our rapidly changing climate. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that communities like mine have already lost so much through the lack of foresight and planning for the foreseeable effects of climate breakdown. I don\u2019t want anyone else to endure what we\u2019ve been through. But many undoubtedly will unless the government strengthens its adaptation plans.\u201d Paulley said: \u201cClimate breakdown threatens us all, but disabled people are disproportionally affected and are always among those who bear the brunt when disaster strikes. The lack of adequate protection in the government\u2019s climate adaptation plan means more disabled people will suffer and die as the impacts of climate change accelerate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former Australia head coach Darren Lehmann has agreed to take charge of County Championship side Northamptonshire. The 54-year-old led his country to World Cup success in 2015 and helmed four Ashes series between 2013 and 2018, winning two on home soil but losing both in England. He then resigned in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. Lehmann will start his new role in February, having penned an initial two-year deal. He had previously spent several years in county cricket as a prolific overseas player for Yorkshire and returned to Headingley for one season in charge of Northern Superchargers in the Hundred in 2021. \u201cNorthamptonshire has a great history in our game,\u201d he said. \u201cI am looking forward to meeting the players and learning about the club and its past and creating our own history over the coming months and years. The selling point for me is a group that wants to get better and follow their and the club\u2019s dreams, create memories and play at the highest level possible. I\u2019m sure we will have success and fun along the way.\u201d Lehmann replaces John Sadler, who left the club last month after three years in charge. Northamptonshire ended the season in fourth place in Division Two of the County Championship, and last won a trophy in the 2016 T20 Blast tournament. \u201cI am delighted we have been able to secure a new head coach with the history, reputation, skills and knowledge that Darren possesses,\u201d said the Northants chief executive, Ray Payne. \u201cIt is a real marker in the ground and demonstrates, once again, the club\u2019s desire to achieve to its highest level on the field. \u201cFrom our first conversation with Darren, it was clear to see his passion and excitement for the opportunity. His coaching philosophy is something that aligns well with the goals of the club.\u201d",

The pension plebiscite has also been criticised for overshadowing other issues in Uruguay, in particular child poverty and poor education rates. One in five children live in poverty. Meanwhile, only about half of students finish secondary school, one of the lowest rates in Latin America. \u201cStructural issues like pensions do need to be discussed, but also we need to look at more urgent issues like poverty,\u201d said Sylvia Ibarguren, a member of the chamber of representatives of Uruguay, of the leftist Broad Front party. Uruguay has long been known as a bastion of democracy, ranked 14th globally by the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2023, ahead of the UK at 18, and the US at 29. Plebiscites have been used since the 1990s to vote on topics including the privatisation of public services, amnesty laws, anti-crime policies and water rights. On Sunday the electorate will also vote on whether to allow nighttime police raids on homes, spurred by growing concerns about organised crime and public safety. It comes as surging gang violence \u2013 in part fuelled by shifting cocaine smuggling routes \u2013 has shaken the proudly peaceful nation. Uruguay, which is home to 3.4 million people, suffered a record 426 murders in 2018, and violence has remained high ever since, as low-level gangs vie for control. Earlier this month, a baby was killed after being shot three times during a turf battle, while in September six people died after a fire was intentionally set in a prison. Uruguay\u2019s homicide rate currently sits at 11 per 100,000, more than double the rate of neighbouring Argentina and nearby Chile. \u201cUruguayans see their country as a stable and peaceful place,\u201d said John Walsh, the director of drug policy at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cBy and large that has remained true for a long time \u2013 and now Uruguyans are understandably alarmed. They have a sense that their security is slipping.\u201d For the presidential election itself, voters say insecurity, unemployment and drug trafficking are their top concerns. Yet, generally, analysts say there is a lack of interest from the public about the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s not mobilising people,\u201d said Sald\u00edas. \u201cUruguay has overall been doing OK, so they think, why change that?\u201d",

Vice-president Kamala Harris appeared with Barack Obama for the first time on the campaign trail in Atlanta, where she told the rally that she was leading \u201ca fight for the future\u201d and underlined her support for abortion rights. She spoke about cutting the costs of medicines, housing and groceries. \u201cI come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from,\u201d she said. She contrasted herself with the Republican candidate, saying she believes \u201chealthcare should be a right\u201d while Donald Trump would destroy the Affordable Care Act and roll back the $35 cap on insulin. Democratic activists have downplayed commentators\u2019 analyses that Harris\u2019s campaign has been losing support among Black male voters \u2013 but as election day approach, her campaign has notably targeted its messaging to Black voters. What did Obama say? He warned that just because Trump\u2019s behavior is \u201cgoofy\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t dangerous. Who else was there? It was a star-studded event, including Samuel L Jackson, Spike Lee, Tyler Perry and Bruce Springsteen, who said Trump was running to be \u201can American tyrant\u201d. Trump says immigrants have made US into a \u2018garbage can\u2019 Donald Trump described the US as a \u201cgarbage can\u201d while campaigning in Arizona on Thursday, blaming immigration. \u201cWe\u2019re like a garbage can, you know, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said that,\u201d Trump said in Tempe, Arizona. \u201cAnd every time I come up and talk about what they\u2019ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I\u2019ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it\u2019s a very accurate description.\u201d Candidates have been hyperfocused on swing states such as Arizona as election day looms on 5 November.

Where else has he campaigned? Trump was in Georgia the day before, where Tucker Carlson compared him to an angry father spanking his daughter in a bizarre speech that led the audience to chant: \u201cDaddy Don\u201d and \u201cDaddy\u2019s home\u201d. Israel\u2019s plan to ban Unrwa from accessing Gaza marks new low in its relations with UN Relations between Israel and the UN appear to have hit rock bottom as the country prepares to pass legislation banning the UN relief and works agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) from operating in Gaza and West Bank.

      "body": "<h2>The regular season was defined by ...</h2> <p>If last season was defined by Lionel Messi, this one was about <strong>Inter Miami as a whole</strong>. The club built the plane as they were flying it, stretching the MLS rulebook to its absolute limit as it added players, shedded others, and ended the season with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/inter-miami-points-record-lionel-messi\">best-ever points total in league history</a>. Big spending and sporting success haven\u2019t usually gone hand-in-hand in MLS, but 2024 was the year that Miami showed that era is well and truly over. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>More <strong>fun, interesting teams</strong> than we\u2019ve ever seen take the field in a single MLS season. In the league\u2019s 29th campaign, four teams averaged at least 1.87 points per game (which translates to at least a 64-point pace across the existing 34-game schedule) for the first time. Hats off to Miami, Columbus, LAFC, and the Galaxy. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>Inter Miami chasing \u2013 and achieving \u2013 history. </strong>Even when Messi wasn\u2019t there over the summer, it was about whether Tata Martino could keep his team on track for the Supporters\u2019 Shield. That Inter Miami were able to maintain consistent form over the full season says a lot about their impressive squad-building. It\u2019s not all about Messi, as it turns out. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Best team that didn\u2019t make the playoffs ...</h2> <p>It\u2019s pretty clear that the <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong> are a much better team than they showed this year. They still have a lot of talent, a productive academy system, and most of the key figures that made them a 2022 MLS Cup finalist and consistent threat for the last several years. The defending was too haphazard in 2024 though, resulting in a lot of lost leads \u2013 a league-worst 27 points dropped from winning positions. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>You have to be pretty darn bad \u2013 or pretty darn unlucky \u2013 to miss the playoffs in a league where 62% of teams make the postseason. The <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong>, who finished with the eighth-best xG differential in the league according to FBref, probably fall into that latter category. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p>2024 could have been very different for <strong>FC Dallas</strong> had they been able to get their best players on the pitch more often. Injuries hit the Texans hard. Two (Alan Velasco and Jesus Ferreira) of their three Designated Players played under 1,400 minutes over the campaign. Even Petar Musa, who scored 16 goals, was bitten by a Frisco injury bug that compromised Dallas\u2019s season. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Your dark horses are ...</h2> <p><strong>In the West: Vancouver.</strong> Wednesday\u2019s 5-0 thrashing of Portland in the wildcard game will have them flying high, and in Ryan Gauld they have a special player who can turn the fortunes of just about any game. <strong>In the East: Charlotte FC.</strong> Kristijan Kahlina has put in several match-winning performances this year, and there\u2019s no reason to think he isn\u2019t capable of something similar in the playoffs. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Though the playoff field is more top-heavy than ever, I\u2019m not prepared to bet against the <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong>. They have the league\u2019s best defense based on goals and xG allowed, not to mention postseason experience. Minnesota United could surprise, too, given that the top of the West looks more vulnerable than the top of the East. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>Minnesota United</strong>. The sixth seeds in the Western Conference have performed admirably this season considering Eric Ramsay\u2019s late arrival, and the Loons might have timed their run for the playoffs perfectly, winning four of their final five regular-season games. If Kelvin Yeboah can stay hot, Minnesota could go far. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Big team at risk of going out early ...</h2> <p><strong>LA Galaxy.</strong> Greg Vanney\u2019s side have been great fun to watch, but they boast the worst defensive record of all playoff qualifiers. Their opponents Colorado have lost four straight heading into the playoffs, but then so had Vancouver before dominating Portland. Djordje Mihailovic is adept at picking apart defenses, and the Galaxy\u2019s could be next in line. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Both No 3 seeds \u2013 FC Cincinnati and Real Salt Lake \u2013 could go out in the first round. But if I\u2019m going really big? A first round or conference semifinal meltdown is absolutely not beneath the <strong>LA Galaxy</strong>. They\u2019re an elite attacking team, but one with huge defensive flaws. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>FC Cincinnati.</strong> Pat Noonan\u2019s team may struggle to live up to their billing as third seeds in the East. Injuries have depleted Cincy, with Aaron Boupendza\u2019s contract termination leaving them short of a match-winning No 9. Problems at both ends of the pitch makes FC Cincinnati vulnerable against New York City FC in round one. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Player to watch ...</h2> <p>It\u2019s Messi. Sorry. But if you\u2019re looking for a slightly more under-the-radar selection than the most famous and best player to ever kick a ball, may I suggest Real Salt Lake\u2019s <strong>Diego Luna</strong>. The US youth international\u2019s energetic style and flair for the dramatic puts him right at home in a side that is always keen on making any game a battle. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Messi, of course, is the right answer. But let\u2019s give <strong>Cucho Hern\u00e1ndez</strong> some love, shall we? The 25-year-old Columbus Crew star is part striker, part winger, part attacking midfielder, and all fun. He\u2019s worked his way into the Colombian national team and is the one who makes Wilfried Nancy\u2019s system sing. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>Gabriel Pec</strong> could be the key to the LA Galaxy making a deep run. The Brazilian is in exceptional form, having scored in each of his last five games. If he can keep that up, the Cup could be on its way to Carson again. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Eastern Conference final ...</h2> <p>Inter Miami over Columbus Crew. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Inter Miami over Columbus Crew. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p>Columbus Crew over Inter Miami. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Western Conference final ...</h2> <p>Real Salt Lake over Seattle Sounders. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>LAFC over LA Galaxy. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p>LAFC over LA Galaxy. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>MLS Cup final ...</h2> <p><strong>Inter Miami over Real Salt Lake.</strong> Real Salt Lake have a chance to fulfill their role as MLS\u2019s eternal dark horse, and they\u2019ll show enough fight to make the game a classic. But we all know how this is going to end. In a one-off format, in a final, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point in doubting what Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and all of their teammates can do. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p><strong>Inter Miami over LAFC.</strong> I\u2019m not bold (or foolish?) enough to pick against an Inter Miami team with the greatest player ever fresh off setting the single-season points record. We\u2019ve never seen anything like 2024 Inter Miami in MLS, and neither have opposing defenses by the looks of it. They\u2019ll have more than enough juice to lift MLS Cup. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>Columbus Crew over LAFC.</strong> After Messi Mania and referee lockouts and US Open Cup controversy and everything else in between, a rematch of last year\u2019s MLS Cup final could be on the cards. Inter Miami have Messi, but Columbus have Wilfried Nancy and not only do the Crew play the most exciting brand of soccer in MLS, they know how to win knockout matches. <strong>GR</strong></p>",

Grape ivy is also a forgiving plant that thrives even in low-light conditions, making it an excellent choice for beginners or spaces with less-than-ideal lighting. Light or shade?

      "bodyText": "Climate scientists who were mocked and gaslighted after speaking up about their fears for the future have said acknowledging strong emotions is vital to their work. The researchers said these feelings should not be suppressed in an attempt to reach supposed objectivity. Seeing climate experts\u2019 fears and opinions about the climate crisis as irrelevant suggests science is separate from society and ultimately weakens it, they said. The researchers said they had been subject to ridicule by some scientists after taking part in a large Guardian survey of experts in May, during which they and many others expressed their feelings of extreme fear about future temperature rises and the world\u2019s failure to take sufficient action. They said they had been told they were not qualified to take part in this broad discussion of the climate crisis, were spreading doom and were not impartial. However, the researchers said that embracing their emotions was necessary to do good science and was a spur to working towards better ways of tackling the climate crisis and the rapidly increasing damage being done to the world. They also said that those dismissing their fears as doom-laden and alarmist were speaking frequently from a position of privilege in western countries, with little direct experience of the effects of the climate crisis. The three experts have published a comment article in the journal Nature Climate Change, titled Scientists have emotional responses to climate change too. They said that, at a point when the climate crisis has already arrived and the key questions are how to limit and survive it, their aim in speaking out was to start a discussion about how climate experts across all disciplines can best communicate the urgency needed with the public. Pretending to be a \u201crobot\u201d is bad science, said Dr Shobha Maharaj, an author of the Nature article from the University of Fiji. \u201cThe basic definition of science is to take all parameters into consideration.

      "body": "<p>Hellah Sidibe has been on a streak since 15 May 2017. Rain or shine, and no matter how his body is feeling, he has gone for a run for the last 2,700-plus days.</p> <p>Sidibe radiates joy. It comes through in the videos he posts on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hellahgood9\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@HellahGood\">YouTube</a> about his running, which typically open with him saying \u201cWhat\u2019s up, my beautiful people?\u201d</p> <p>But before 2017, running was not connected to joy for Sidibe. He dreaded it, because it was used as punishment when he played soccer. He played professionally in Mali, where he grew up.</p> <p>When he tried to continue his professional soccer career in America, his lack of US citizenship (he has since gained it) got in the way of teams signing him. \u201cI came to a point where I was so frustrated in life, I really didn\u2019t know what to do with myself, because now professional soccer wasn\u2019t working out, and I couldn\u2019t find a job,\u201d he says. He thinks he had signs of depression.</p> <p>He had an urge to do something that would make him feel in control. He thought: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try something that you\u2019re a little bit afraid of?\u201d he says. That something was running.</p> <p>Sidibe set out to run for 10 minutes a day for two weeks. But after that, he didn\u2019t want to stop. \u201cI would be so happy when I\u2019m out there, because I\u2019m just thinking to myself, I\u2019m out there for 10 minutes a day and I\u2019m in control, no coaches yelling at me or pointing fingers, and I can stop whenever I want,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me feel whole again.\u201d</p> <p>Sidibe grew up in Mali as a happy kid. \u201cMali is one of the poorest countries in the world,\u201d but people tended to see the glass as half full, not half empty, he says. He started to lose sight of that after coming to the US, where he compared himself more to others. Running got him feeling like himself again.</p> <p>In 2021, Sidibe decided to run across the US to raise money for <a href=\"https://soles4souls.org/\">Soles4Souls</a>, which gives shoes to kids in need around the world. He raised $50,000. It took him 84 days to run 3,061 miles, and he is reportedly the first Black man to run across the US solo.</p> <p>While completing this run as a Black man, Sidibe had the police called on him many times. He knows that people often have preconceptions of what a runner looks like.</p> <p>Once when Sidibe was in Boston, a Black man ran over to him and said Sidibe had given him the confidence to start running. \u201cHe started tearing up, and he told me his story,\u201d Sidibe recalls. \u201cHe said: \u2018When I saw you running, I thought I can run too, because, where I live, in my neighborhood, I\u2019m scared to go running, because people might think that I did something wrong \u2026 like I\u2019m running away from doing something.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sidibe remembers telling the man how he tries to make sure he looks like a runner \u2013like wearing a colorful running shirt and athletic hat. But he realizes not everyone can do that. \u201cWe say running is so accessible \u2013 all you need is a pair of shoes. But it goes beyond just having a pair of shoes,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Most of Sidibe\u2019s miles have been on the roads, both in his run across the country and near where he lives in New Jersey. He has run four marathons. But he found that trail running \u2013 which requires navigating varied terrain \u2013 was fun in a different way.</p> <p>Running and jumping in the woods, he says, \u201cI just feel like a little kid.\u201d When he records himself running on trails and watches it later, he realizes he\u2019s making noises as he runs along, like kids do. \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018Haaa!\u2019 \u2013 these weird noises, I don\u2019t even know that\u2019s happening at the time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>During Sidibe\u2019s run across the country, someone suggested that he run the 100-mile Leadville Trail race. He ran it in 2022 and then ran the Western States 100 in 2023. Running these long trail or ultramarathon races is a different kind of challenge \u2013 it\u2019s like playing a chess game with himself, he says.</p> <p>Now he\u2019s looking forward to running the <a href=\"https://aravaiparunning.com/network/javelinajundred/\">Javelina Jundred 100-miler</a> on Saturday. In this one, he plans to push himself harder than he ever has for 100 miles. \u201cI want to see if I can run a big [personal record], and I\u2019m not talking about two minutes, but shaving hours off my hundred,\u201d he says. His sponsors, including Hoka, Bare Performance Nutrition, and Tifosi Optics, support his running and racing.</p> <p>Sidibe says he loves the trail running community, where people support and look out for each other, and they\u2019re less focused on running against each other than road runners sometimes are. But at these trail races, Black people and other people of color are few and far between. Sidibe says that at Leadville, he didn\u2019t see a single other Black person on the course.</p> <p>He hopes that his presence at these trail races will show other people of color that they can fit into the sport, too. But not everyone can easily get to a trail to run on, Sidibe says. People have told him: \u201cI would love to run trails, but I don\u2019t know where to go, and also, if I go there, would I feel welcome when I get there? \u2026 Is it going to be weird to see me in the woods?

      "bodyText": "Hellah Sidibe has been on a streak since 15 May 2017. Rain or shine, and no matter how his body is feeling, he has gone for a run for the last 2,700-plus days. Sidibe radiates joy. It comes through in the videos he posts on Instagram and YouTube about his running, which typically open with him saying \u201cWhat\u2019s up, my beautiful people?\u201d But before 2017, running was not connected to joy for Sidibe. He dreaded it, because it was used as punishment when he played soccer. He played professionally in Mali, where he grew up. When he tried to continue his professional soccer career in America, his lack of US citizenship (he has since gained it) got in the way of teams signing him. \u201cI came to a point where I was so frustrated in life, I really didn\u2019t know what to do with myself, because now professional soccer wasn\u2019t working out, and I couldn\u2019t find a job,\u201d he says. He thinks he had signs of depression. He had an urge to do something that would make him feel in control. He thought: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try something that you\u2019re a little bit afraid of?\u201d he says. That something was running. Sidibe set out to run for 10 minutes a day for two weeks. But after that, he didn\u2019t want to stop. \u201cI would be so happy when I\u2019m out there, because I\u2019m just thinking to myself, I\u2019m out there for 10 minutes a day and I\u2019m in control, no coaches yelling at me or pointing fingers, and I can stop whenever I want,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me feel whole again.\u201d Sidibe grew up in Mali as a happy kid. \u201cMali is one of the poorest countries in the world,\u201d but people tended to see the glass as half full, not half empty, he says. He started to lose sight of that after coming to the US, where he compared himself more to others. Running got him feeling like himself again. In 2021, Sidibe decided to run across the US to raise money for Soles4Souls, which gives shoes to kids in need around the world. He raised $50,000. It took him 84 days to run 3,061 miles, and he is reportedly the first Black man to run across the US solo. While completing this run as a Black man, Sidibe had the police called on him many times. He knows that people often have preconceptions of what a runner looks like. Once when Sidibe was in Boston, a Black man ran over to him and said Sidibe had given him the confidence to start running. \u201cHe started tearing up, and he told me his story,\u201d Sidibe recalls. \u201cHe said: \u2018When I saw you running, I thought I can run too, because, where I live, in my neighborhood, I\u2019m scared to go running, because people might think that I did something wrong \u2026 like I\u2019m running away from doing something.\u2019\u201d Sidibe remembers telling the man how he tries to make sure he looks like a runner \u2013like wearing a colorful running shirt and athletic hat. But he realizes not everyone can do that. \u201cWe say running is so accessible \u2013 all you need is a pair of shoes. But it goes beyond just having a pair of shoes,\u201d he says. Most of Sidibe\u2019s miles have been on the roads, both in his run across the country and near where he lives in New Jersey. He has run four marathons. But he found that trail running \u2013 which requires navigating varied terrain \u2013 was fun in a different way. Running and jumping in the woods, he says, \u201cI just feel like a little kid.\u201d When he records himself running on trails and watches it later, he realizes he\u2019s making noises as he runs along, like kids do. \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018Haaa!\u2019 \u2013 these weird noises, I don\u2019t even know that\u2019s happening at the time,\u201d he says. During Sidibe\u2019s run across the country, someone suggested that he run the 100-mile Leadville Trail race. He ran it in 2022 and then ran the Western States 100 in 2023. Running these long trail or ultramarathon races is a different kind of challenge \u2013 it\u2019s like playing a chess game with himself, he says. Now he\u2019s looking forward to running the Javelina Jundred 100-miler on Saturday. In this one, he plans to push himself harder than he ever has for 100 miles. \u201cI want to see if I can run a big [personal record], and I\u2019m not talking about two minutes, but shaving hours off my hundred,\u201d he says. His sponsors, including Hoka, Bare Performance Nutrition, and Tifosi Optics, support his running and racing. Sidibe says he loves the trail running community, where people support and look out for each other, and they\u2019re less focused on running against each other than road runners sometimes are. But at these trail races, Black people and other people of color are few and far between. Sidibe says that at Leadville, he didn\u2019t see a single other Black person on the course. He hopes that his presence at these trail races will show other people of color that they can fit into the sport, too. But not everyone can easily get to a trail to run on, Sidibe says. People have told him: \u201cI would love to run trails, but I don\u2019t know where to go, and also, if I go there, would I feel welcome when I get there? \u2026 Is it going to be weird to see me in the woods? Am I going to get stared at? I\u2019m kind of nervous.\u201d Race entry fees can be several hundred dollars, plus the cost of lodging and transportation to races, putting them out of reach for many people. Sidibe hopes to see the trail running community improve accessibility to people of color, such as by covering race fees and travel. He would like to create a program that invites people of color to run a trail race, paying for their shoes, gear, race fee, and travel expenses. Sidibe has been making running accessible to others in a different way as well: He has been volunteering as a guide for a blind runner, through Achilles International. He learned to hold a tether between himself and the runner, and Sidibe guided the pair to a sub-four-hour marathon. Through his run streak, Sidibe has learned two main lessons: \u201cI am much stronger than I think I am,\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s always light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he says. In his run across the US, \u201cThere would be one day when you\u2019re miserable, you can barely pick your leg up, and then you survive that day.

It\u2019s more like opening an Advent calendar than playing a video game. But it pleases me. Maybe I didn\u2019t get enough Advent calendars as a kid. Or maybe it\u2019s because we have no adventuring left in the real world. Nothing left to explore. Nothing to pioneer. I emigrated to Canada in 2009, only to find the whole country had already been discovered. So I became a zealous missionary, opening up a crucial trade route: every year I transport British people over here on vacation to import irony, and send Canadians on visits to my recommended places in the UK, where they arrive with suitcases full of passive aggression.</p> <p>Next, I try out a new Halloween-themed scenario. Hello! Playing as Cleopatra, you can only have the most basic military units \u2026 but that unit can convert barbarians into zombies. <em>Y</em><em>our</em> zombies. And then those zombies can make <em>more</em> zombies. Before you can say \u201c<em>brainzzzz</em>\u201d you amass an army of the undead large enough to surround entire cities and take them for you. I love it!</p> <p>I realise that at some point the rest of the world will develop jet fighters that will easily take my zombies down, but I don\u2019t get that far.

My first warrior, my first builder, my first buildings. I start each turn talking to them, like I do to players in Championship Manager:</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Frank, how\u2019s it going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat, boss.

      "body": "<p>When I first began working in the beer industry, the words \u201ccraft beer\u201d were used as a shorthand to describe any beer that wasn\u2019t cask or a more well-understood style or brand, such as lager or Guinness. (A caveat here: in Lancashire, where I live, \u201cnormal\u201d beer has always been cask. When I worked in a local pub, calling something craft beer was a useful, if not mostly meaningless, way to explain to a customer that what they were getting wasn\u2019t a pint of bitter.)</p> <p>Over time, people came to understand that craft beer usually referred to one of those new American-style beers, full of hops and probably hazy. People were suspicious at first. Then they grew to love it, coming in each week to try new beers by breweries with unusual names, excited to taste the latest inventions in hops and malt.</p> <p>Craft beer quickly became big business, which was a difficult hypocrisy to settle for many of its fans.

      "bodyText": "When I first began working in the beer industry, the words \u201ccraft beer\u201d were used as a shorthand to describe any beer that wasn\u2019t cask or a more well-understood style or brand, such as lager or Guinness. (A caveat here: in Lancashire, where I live, \u201cnormal\u201d beer has always been cask. When I worked in a local pub, calling something craft beer was a useful, if not mostly meaningless, way to explain to a customer that what they were getting wasn\u2019t a pint of bitter.) Over time, people came to understand that craft beer usually referred to one of those new American-style beers, full of hops and probably hazy. People were suspicious at first. Then they grew to love it, coming in each week to try new beers by breweries with unusual names, excited to taste the latest inventions in hops and malt. Craft beer quickly became big business, which was a difficult hypocrisy to settle for many of its fans. This alternative style of beer was marketed as underground, as \u201cpunk\u201d, and sold to drinkers as independent, fresh, exciting, and nothing to do with the big corporate beer conglomerates that ruled the pubs and taps up and down the country. In the US, craft beer had created a whole universe of beer drinkers who wanted to care about the quality of their beer and the artisanal way in which it was made \u2013 by skilled professionals, in small batches, often in their own brew pubs.

The demand for a crisp, juicy, hazy pale ale, or a grapefruit-tart IPA, has seen taps emerge from darkly stained Victorian bar tops to serve Neck Oil, Camden Pale Ale or Punk IPA, where in the past there might have been only bitter, pale and stout.

      "body": "<p>Amy Nash is an area fleet manager for \u0160koda UK, looking after businesses with fleets comprised of \u0160koda cars across the south-west and south coast of England. She describes here what a typical day for her entails \u2013 although, as she says, there\u2019s really no such thing as \u201ctypical\u201d \u2013 as well as explaining why the all-new \u0160koda Superb is an exciting proposition for fleet drivers.</p> <p><strong>Preparation starts before bedtime</strong><br>Nash\u2019s day starts the night before. \u201cI always plan my journeys in advance,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore I switch off my laptop and phone for the night, I log into the My\u0160koda app on my mobile.\u201d</p> <p>Entering her first destination into the app, it sends the details to her \u0160koda Superb Estate, Laurin &amp; Klement, 1.5 TSI iV plug-in hybrid. It means that when her alarm goes off, there\u2019s no scrambling for postcodes, she just grabs a coffee and heads for her first meeting after the school run.</p> <p>The Superb plug-in hybrid is available as an estate and delivers an electric range of up to 84 miles \u2013 giving drivers the option of travelling on electric power, petrol power or a combination of the two. What\u2019s more, its lower CO2 emissions mean drivers who choose it as their company car pay less tax on the benefit than if they\u2019d gone for a vehicle that ran just on petrol or diesel \u2013 at 5% Benefit-in-Kind (BiK).</p>        <ul> <li><p>Nash uses the My\u0160koda app for seamless business driving, with routes planned out in advance</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Arriving fresh and ready to go<br></strong>Nash\u2019s first meeting is with a prospective customer two hours away. With her mobile charging on one of the two wireless smartphone charging pads in the Superb, she\u2019s on her way. \u201cThe Superb has seamlessly picked up the destination I sent it last night,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also syncs with my phone, so I have access to my music \u2013 although as an audiobook fan, I usually pop one of them on.\u201d</p> <p>Innovative technology is offered as standard in the all-new Superb, including Wireless SmartLink for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a 13in touchscreen display with satellite navigation.</p> <p>Driver and safety systems such as lane assist and blind spot detection underpin the drivability of the car. While the massage function on the driver\u2019s seat, a standard feature on every new Superb model at no extra cost, helps ensure that Nash arrives at her meetings refreshed and ready to go.</p> <p><strong>Listen and inform<br></strong>Nash\u2019s meetings are a chance to build relationships with her clients, which include many well-known UK businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand how their fleet is run and what they want from it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about recognising pinch points and removing any stresses.\u201d</p>        <p>Her meetings often include an opportunity to give product updates, such as providing a deep dive into the key features of new products, including the all-new \u0160koda Superb. She also arranges demonstration vehicles for customers, to help staff choose the right car for them. The goal is to provide a bespoke service, says Nash, as no two customers are the same. As well as technical support and product advice, she uses her knowledge and experience to tell them about industry-wide regulations updates and even to advise companies on formulating internal fleet policies.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to be a good listener, says Nash. Businesses are increasingly focused on saving time and costs, as well as meeting sustainability objectives and addressing their environmental footprint. Fleet managers also help to keep their clients on top of changes in legislation, taxation or interest rates that can affect fleet operations.</p> <p>\u201cI constantly ask myself how I can support customers,\u201d says Nash. \u201cWe want them to view us as partners, not just suppliers, so we come up with solutions like \u2018lunch and learn\u2019 to help demystify our role. If you\u2019re on holiday with your car and get a flat tyre, all you want to know is how we can fix it.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>For Nash, the new Superb is ideal for doing business on the move \u2013 but also perfect to pack out for weekend trips</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>An office on four wheels</strong><br>First meeting done, Nash stops at a service station to join colleagues on a video call. The spacious, luxurious interior of the Superb serves as a four-wheeled office \u2013 the perfect place for doing business on the move. It\u2019s also a chance to grab a sandwich and charge the car. Her Superb Estate combines a 1.5 TSI petrol engine with an electric motor. When hooked up to a fast 50kW DC charging point, charging the battery from 10% to 80% takes as little as 26 minutes*.</p> <p>Before her next appointment, Nash uses Laura, the AI-based voice recognition function in the Superb, to enter the destination. She could use Laura to access the climate controls, but one of her favourite things about the all-new Superb is the return of Smart Dials, which combine haptic and digital elements. It\u2019s been introduced in response to customer feedback, says Nash. \u201cWe\u2019ve almost gone back to go forwards,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. When you change the temperature you feel it click.\u201d</p>        <ul> <li><p>The Superb\u2019s battery can charge from 10% to 80% in as little as 26 minutes \u2013 ideal for a stop in between meetings</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Work. Life. Balanced</strong><br>After the meeting, and back in her car, the drive home is a chance to make phone calls but also decompress. Waiting for her is her child and three dogs. On weekend trips they all benefit from the huge load capacity of the Superb \u2013 up to 690 litres in the Plug-in hybrid Estate.</p> <p>As she preps for the next day, Nash reflects on the essence of her role. \u201cAs an area fleet manager, the customer relationship is the most important thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about spreadsheets. Our focus is always the people choosing to get behind a \u0160koda steering wheel each day.\u201d</p> <p><em>To learn more about how \u0160koda can support your fleet requirements and explore the all-new Superb further, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.skoda.co.uk/fleet/superb\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u0160koda website</a></em></p> <p><sub>*Charging times will depend on various factors, including temperature, state of the battery, state of and capabilities of the charging unit and power supply. Actual charging time will vary depending on the level of charge in the battery, as well as environmental conditions. Charging times will also be affected by the charging curve \u2013 for example, once charging passes 80%, charging will slow to protect the battery\u2019s longevity.</sub></p>",

With her mobile charging on one of the two wireless smartphone charging pads in the Superb, she\u2019s on her way. \u201cThe Superb has seamlessly picked up the destination I sent it last night,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also syncs with my phone, so I have access to my music \u2013 although as an audiobook fan, I usually pop one of them on.\u201d Innovative technology is offered as standard in the all-new Superb, including Wireless SmartLink for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a 13in touchscreen display with satellite navigation. Driver and safety systems such as lane assist and blind spot detection underpin the drivability of the car. While the massage function on the driver\u2019s seat, a standard feature on every new Superb model at no extra cost, helps ensure that Nash arrives at her meetings refreshed and ready to go. Listen and inform Nash\u2019s meetings are a chance to build relationships with her clients, which include many well-known UK businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand how their fleet is run and what they want from it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about recognising pinch points and removing any stresses.\u201d Her meetings often include an opportunity to give product updates, such as providing a deep dive into the key features of new products, including the all-new \u0160koda Superb. She also arranges demonstration vehicles for customers, to help staff choose the right car for them. The goal is to provide a bespoke service, says Nash, as no two customers are the same. As well as technical support and product advice, she uses her knowledge and experience to tell them about industry-wide regulations updates and even to advise companies on formulating internal fleet policies. It\u2019s important to be a good listener, says Nash. Businesses are increasingly focused on saving time and costs, as well as meeting sustainability objectives and addressing their environmental footprint. Fleet managers also help to keep their clients on top of changes in legislation, taxation or interest rates that can affect fleet operations. \u201cI constantly ask myself how I can support customers,\u201d says Nash. \u201cWe want them to view us as partners, not just suppliers, so we come up with solutions like \u2018lunch and learn\u2019 to help demystify our role. If you\u2019re on holiday with your car and get a flat tyre, all you want to know is how we can fix it.\u201d For Nash, the new Superb is ideal for doing business on the move \u2013 but also perfect to pack out for weekend trips An office on four wheels First meeting done, Nash stops at a service station to join colleagues on a video call. The spacious, luxurious interior of the Superb serves as a four-wheeled office \u2013 the perfect place for doing business on the move. It\u2019s also a chance to grab a sandwich and charge the car. Her Superb Estate combines a 1.5 TSI petrol engine with an electric motor. When hooked up to a fast 50kW DC charging point, charging the battery from 10% to 80% takes as little as 26 minutes*. Before her next appointment, Nash uses Laura, the AI-based voice recognition function in the Superb, to enter the destination. She could use Laura to access the climate controls, but one of her favourite things about the all-new Superb is the return of Smart Dials, which combine haptic and digital elements. It\u2019s been introduced in response to customer feedback, says Nash. \u201cWe\u2019ve almost gone back to go forwards,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. When you change the temperature you feel it click.\u201d The Superb\u2019s battery can charge from 10% to 80% in as little as 26 minutes \u2013 ideal for a stop in between meetings Work. Life. Balanced After the meeting, and back in her car, the drive home is a chance to make phone calls but also decompress. Waiting for her is her child and three dogs. On weekend trips they all benefit from the huge load capacity of the Superb \u2013 up to 690 litres in the Plug-in hybrid Estate. As she preps for the next day, Nash reflects on the essence of her role. \u201cAs an area fleet manager, the customer relationship is the most important thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about spreadsheets. Our focus is always the people choosing to get behind a \u0160koda steering wheel each day.\u201d To learn more about how \u0160koda can support your fleet requirements and explore the all-new Superb further, please visit the \u0160koda website *Charging times will depend on various factors, including temperature, state of the battery, state of and capabilities of the charging unit and power supply. Actual charging time will vary depending on the level of charge in the battery, as well as environmental conditions. Charging times will also be affected by the charging curve \u2013 for example, once charging passes 80%, charging will slow to protect the battery\u2019s longevity.",

Okir, who lives in a village in northern Uganda, first noticed the swelling around his genitalia in 1983. Within a year, the mass had grown large enough that he developed back pain and found it hard to wear trousers and to have sexual relations with his wife.</p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone would look and laugh at me and I felt inferior. It grew quickly,\u201d says Okir, 78. \u201cI felt fear. It was hard to dress. I had a lot of back and waist pain and many issues with my wife. Our relationship wasn\u2019t going well. I was scared to go out in public.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other people in his village had similar growths, including his two brothers, but none sought medical attention. Then, in 2021, Okir attended a burial where the village elders told him he had a hydrocele (scrotal swelling), a symptom of lymphatic filariasis (LF), and that surgery would help him.

      "bodyText": "For decades, a growth the size of a large melon made Raymondo Okir\u2019s life miserable. Okir, who lives in a village in northern Uganda, first noticed the swelling around his genitalia in 1983. Within a year, the mass had grown large enough that he developed back pain and found it hard to wear trousers and to have sexual relations with his wife. \u201cEveryone would look and laugh at me and I felt inferior. It grew quickly,\u201d says Okir, 78. \u201cI felt fear. It was hard to dress. I had a lot of back and waist pain and many issues with my wife. Our relationship wasn\u2019t going well. I was scared to go out in public.\u201d Other people in his village had similar growths, including his two brothers, but none sought medical attention. Then, in 2021, Okir attended a burial where the village elders told him he had a hydrocele (scrotal swelling), a symptom of lymphatic filariasis (LF), and that surgery would help him. He went to get treatment; during the operation, the medical team drained about three litres of fluid from the swelling around his scrotum. LF, which can be painful and disfiguring, is transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes. It is included on the World Heath Organization\u2019s (WHO) list of neglected tropical diseases. At the end of 2022, 794 million people were living in areas considered at risk for infection throughout Asia, Africa, the western Pacific, and parts of the Caribbean and South America, while 51.4 million people were estimated to be infected in 2018. The disease is seen in the most marginalised populations in rural areas with poor infrastructure, housing, water and sanitation. Infection usually happens in childhood, damaging the lymphatic system. The profoundly disfiguring manifestations of the disease \u2013 lymphoedema (tissue swelling) or elephantiasis (skin/tissue thickening) of limbs and hydrocele (scrotal swelling) \u2013 occur later in life. At least 36 million people remain with these chronic disease manifestations.

Officials carried out studies to determine how many people were affected; up to 17 million people were thought to be at risk and 6 million, close to a third of the population at the time, were estimated to have the disease, he says.

It\u2019s far from comprehensive \u2013 there\u2019s no Angie Bowie or Tin Machine, and little prior to Ziggy \u2013 but it nails the shape-shifting quality of a musician always ahead of the curve. Saturday 26 October, 10.10pm, Channel 4 *** Martha For UK readers, Martha Stewart is like a supercharged cross between Delia Smith, Alan Titchmarsh and Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. The first female self-made billionaire in US history, she built an empire of books, magazines and TV shows based on domestic tips and an aura of homespun authenticity, then lost it all when she was jailed for lying about a stock trade. Through interviews with her, plus candid excerpts from her diaries and letters, RJ Cutler\u2019s fascinating documentary gives us a real sense of \u201cthe original influencer\u201d in all her contradictory glory. Wednesday 30 October, Netflix *** Midas Man Perhaps because he died aged 32 in 1967, the Beatles\u2019 manager Brian Epstein hasn\u2019t had the spotlight he deserves. Joe Stephenson\u2019s biopic tries, mostly successfully, to redress the balance. With no original Beatles music in the film (possibly due to cost) there is much dancing around the big events, but Epstein\u2019s own life \u2013 expanding the family\u2019s Liverpool furniture business into music, amphetamine addiction, a secretive, then-illegal sex life \u2013 is plenty in itself, and Jacob Fortune-Lloyd plays him with a compelling mix of nervous energy and single-minded charm. Wednesday 30 October, Prime Video *** Enys Men Following his inventive no-budget feature debut Bait, Mark Jenkin has stayed in Cornwall for an evocative ghost story. Mary Woodvine plays a lone researcher on a small island in 1973, there to monitor a clump of nondescript flowers. But visions of the place\u2019s past \u2013 tin miners, fishing folk, a priest \u2013 and her own memories start to intrude on her routine. With the grainy look of a recently unearthed old film and a soundtrack in which every noise seems weighted with meaning, it\u2019s a beautiful, haunting drama. Thursday 31 October, 11.15pm, Film4 *** Music By John Williams After all these years, it\u2019s still a surprise to realise John Williams is the author of so many superb soundtracks. Laurent Bouzereau\u2019s affectionate tribute to the greatest composer in the history of cinema rightly spends a bunch of time on his long collaboration with Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, ET, Schindler\u2019s List, those five \u201cspiritual\u201d notes in Close Encounters), but then there\u2019s Star Wars, Home Alone, Harry Potter \u2026 The son of a jazz drummer and a dancer, Williams has also found time to conduct and create pieces for the likes of Yo-Yo Ma and Anne-Sophie Mutter. A bringer of joy. Friday 1 November, Disney+ *** Freedom Actor turned director M\u00e9lanie Laurent has clearly taken on board the success of Netflix crime series Lupin. This fact-based caper about 1970s robber Bruno Sulak (Emily in Paris love interest Lucas Bravo) lays into Lupin\u2019s romantic \u201cgentleman thief\u201d angle while ticking off its protagonist\u2019s incident-packed career. From supermarket robberies in the south of France to jewel heists in Paris \u2013 with a couple of prison breaks and a love story involving accomplice Annie (L\u00e9a Luce Busato) thrown in \u2013 Laurent keeps it sunny, sexy and largely free from violence.

The Dodgers are their toughest test yet but if the Yankees keep up their sensational on-base percentage, watch out. Torres has reached base in the first inning of eight of the nine Yankees\u2019 playoff games. Also, it\u2019s time for Judge to step it up. <strong>MJ</strong></p> \n<p>Get a <strong>few more innings out of their starting pitchers</strong>. The Yankees\u2019 rotation arms didn\u2019t get out of the fifth inning in four of the club\u2019s five ALCS games against the Guardians. If you are manager Aaron Boone, you probably feel pretty good about your back-end bullpen trio of Tommy Kahnle, Clay Holmes, and Luke Weaver. But you\u2019d like to get to them with a lead. <strong>AK</strong></p> \n<p>The first thing they need to do is <strong>figure out how to beat a proper playoff team</strong>, which they haven\u2019t done in this postseason. The Yanks are more or less a .500 club since the start of June, and the American League was trash this season. That means defeating the Dodgers will be a stretch. New York will also need to get other players besides Judge, Soto and Giancarlo Stanton to hit with regularity. And they\u2019ll also have to find a way to get Dodger hitters out, which is extremely difficult because they have a long lineup that murders pitching, even with a limited Freddie Freeman. Gerrit Cole has to dominate two games or New York have zero chance. <strong>DL</strong></p> \n<h2>What the Dodgers need to do to win ...</h2> \n<p><strong>Scrape together enough pitching to win four games</strong>. Jack Flaherty and Yoshinobu Yamamoto have had shaky postseasons but are coming off strong regular seasons (3.17 and 3.00 ERAs respectively). But after that things get worrying \u2013 likely third starter Walker Buehler has been consistently inconsistent all year, giving up at least three hits in every single outing and LA\u2019s bullpen, itself weakened by injury, will be crucial. <strong>AE</strong></p> \n<p><strong>A bounceback game from Flaherty</strong> to kick-off the series as well as stick a fork in Cole, whose ERA is better on the road. But LA\u2019s batting is so strong. Ohtani, Max Muncy and even Freeman are well set up to take advantage of the short porch at Yankee Stadium, which could mean lights out for New York. A step up from Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez and Will Smith would <em>especially</em> make the Dodgers lethal. <strong>MJ</strong></p> \n<p>Hope that some mixture of rest, luck, and painkillers <strong>gets reeman back into a groove</strong> as he mends an ankle injury. Muncy and Tommy Edman picked up the offensive slack for him during the NLCS. Let\u2019s not bet on that continuing. <strong>AK</strong></p> \n<p>LA\u2019s lineup needs to <strong>wear out the Yankees\u2019 starters</strong> and put some innings on that New York bullpen. They also need to catch the ball, which was an issue at times in the NLCS. Then Dave Roberts must out manage Boone, which is mandatory considering Boone is no Miller Huggins. <strong>DL</strong></p> \n<h2>One bold prediction \u2026</h2> \n<p>We will see <strong>MLB\u2019s 22nd ever combined no-hitter</strong>. The past decade has seen a much greater willingness from coaches to pull starters early in close playoff games, and it\u2019s rare to see a pitcher reach a third time through the order. The well-rested and healthier Yankees seem more likely to pull it off. <strong>AE</strong></p> \n<p><strong>At least three games will go into extra innings</strong>. Given the makeup of these two teams, especially the respective strengths in their pitching portfolios, it\u2019s easy to envision the Dodgers taking several leads with the Yankees storming back. Luckily, baseball\u2019s newish rules will ensure we\u2019re glued to our screens into the wee hours. <strong>MJ</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Ohtani has a mildly down series</strong>. The Yankees will plan to start Carlos Rod\u00f3n twice, and the southpaw is hell on lefty hitters like Ohtani. Plus, the greatest ballplayer in the world having a mediocre six or seven games is <em>exactly </em>the kind of thing that a cruel sport like baseball can deliver at will. <strong>AK</strong></p> \n<p>It\u2019s Game 7, we\u2019re deep into extra innings and LA are out of pitching options. Now Ohtani is jogging from the dugout and down to the Dodgers bullpen. Wait, is he doing what we think he\u2019s doing? Is this really happening? <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/41987601/dodgers-shohei-ohtani-pitch-world-series-roberts-says\">Even though Roberts said it wouldn\u2019t?</a> Yes, yes and yes. To the complete astonishment of the baseball world, <strong>Ohtani is warming up to pitch</strong>. It\u2019s the afternoon in Tokyo and Japan has ground to a halt. All eyes are on the big baseball god from Oshu as he climbs the hill to face the big Yankees bats in the top of the 16h inning. Then he takes them down, in order. Jaws are dropped: Dodgers win. <strong>DL</strong></p> \n<h2>World Series MVP \u2026</h2> \n<p><strong>Gerrit Cole</strong>. He\u2019ll be expected to outlast Flaherty in Game 1 (and probably Game 4), and there\u2019s a good chance the Yankees take both of those games behind him. Unless one of the big bats goes on a roll, that could well be enough to take the MVP in a tight series. <strong>AE</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong>. The dude\u2019s the greatest player on the planet. He showed up big in the regular season and he\u2019s been clutch this postseason, and is 6-for-9 with runners in scoring position. Ohtani\u2019s three-run homer in the second inning of Game 1 of the NLDS v the Padres set the tone for that series and the entire Dodgers\u2019 playoff run. <strong>MJ</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Mookie Betts</strong>. The Dodgers\u2019 generational right fielder has had a torrid playoffs even with Freeman, his usual protection in the batting order, providing very little threat. If Freeman can get a few early knocks and scare the Yankees into lobbing a few more meatballs in Betts\u2019s general direction, watch out. <strong>AK</strong></p> \n<p>Well it won\u2019t be a Dodgers pitcher, like, say, Yamamoto, because he\u2019s only pitching once in this short series. I can imagine someone like <strong>Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez</strong> taking over and dominating New York. Especially as he looked so terrible against the Mets in the NLCS, with an OPS of .391. That\u2019s another way of saying that Hern\u00e1ndez is due. <strong>DL</strong></p> \n<h2>Your World Series winner will be \u2026</h2> \n<p><strong>Yankees 4-2 Dodgers.</strong> Some would argue the real winner of this ratings-friendly blockbuster matchup has already been decided: it\u2019s commissioner Rob Manfred. But on the field it\u2019s hard not to suspect the Yankees and their relatively healthy and well-rounded lineup will progress serenely towards yet another title. <strong>AE</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Dodgers 4-3 Yankees.</strong> It comes down to batting. The Yankees have more pop but have a bit of a downturn in the back half of their starting lineup. The Dodgers are just as dangerous from a power perspective and almost the entire lineup is a threat. LA are also quite adept at avoiding strikeouts. But, mostly, they\u2019re the team with Ohtani. <strong>MJ</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Yankees 4-3 Dodgers.</strong> These teams are evenly matched, and anyone who thinks either side has a strong advantage is kidding themselves. But with things as equal as they appear to be, I\u2019ll go with the team that has four healthy starting pitchers instead of three. <strong>AK</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Dodgers 4-1 Yankees.</strong> New York will be lucky to get a game off LA as these Yankees are a two-, sometimes three-trick pony at best. Their record was artificially inflated by a quick start in a bad league. Their flawed lineup lacks balance and relies entirely on its heavy top, and I wouldn\u2019t trust Cole in a big spot. LA wipe the floor with New York in five games, most of which are blowouts that won\u2019t help the much ballyhooed bicoastal ratings bonanza. <strong>DL</strong></p>",

AK Well it won\u2019t be a Dodgers pitcher, like, say, Yamamoto, because he\u2019s only pitching once in this short series. I can imagine someone like Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez taking over and dominating New York. Especially as he looked so terrible against the Mets in the NLCS, with an OPS of .391. That\u2019s another way of saying that Hern\u00e1ndez is due. DL Your World Series winner will be \u2026 Yankees 4-2 Dodgers. Some would argue the real winner of this ratings-friendly blockbuster matchup has already been decided: it\u2019s commissioner Rob Manfred. But on the field it\u2019s hard not to suspect the Yankees and their relatively healthy and well-rounded lineup will progress serenely towards yet another title. AE Dodgers 4-3 Yankees. It comes down to batting. The Yankees have more pop but have a bit of a downturn in the back half of their starting lineup. The Dodgers are just as dangerous from a power perspective and almost the entire lineup is a threat. LA are also quite adept at avoiding strikeouts. But, mostly, they\u2019re the team with Ohtani. MJ Yankees 4-3 Dodgers. These teams are evenly matched, and anyone who thinks either side has a strong advantage is kidding themselves. But with things as equal as they appear to be, I\u2019ll go with the team that has four healthy starting pitchers instead of three. AK Dodgers 4-1 Yankees. New York will be lucky to get a game off LA as these Yankees are a two-, sometimes three-trick pony at best. Their record was artificially inflated by a quick start in a bad league. Their flawed lineup lacks balance and relies entirely on its heavy top, and I wouldn\u2019t trust Cole in a big spot. LA wipe the floor with New York in five games, most of which are blowouts that won\u2019t help the much ballyhooed bicoastal ratings bonanza. DL",

      "body": "<h2><strong>The prosecution: Will</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>It\u2019s embarrassing seeing Harriet\u2019s bras and pants lying around the flat when people come over</em></p> </blockquote> <p>My mate Harriet lives with me in our shared rented flat. We\u2019re pretty close and have been since university, when we met on our history course. We work well together as flatmates.</p> <p>We moved in together two years ago but we are quite different. I\u2019m fairly organised and private, but Harriet loves to air her dirty laundry in public \u2013 literally. We have a tiny flat with no garden and a limited number of shared spaces, and Harriet is constantly drying her clothes on the radiators. I&nbsp;think this is embarrassing \u2013 especially when it\u2019s her underwear.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve had girls I\u2019ve been seeing back at the house and they have asked: \u2018Whose bras are these?\u2019 </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not that I have a problem with seeing women\u2019s underwear, I just don\u2019t think it looks particularly inviting when we have people round. I&nbsp;have had girls I\u2019ve been seeing back at the house, and they have asked, \u201cWhose bras are these?\u201d because Harriet will sling them over every radiator. One time she even came into my room and put her stuff on my radiator. I\u2019d brought someone home with me, and it got awkward.</p> <p>We are close mates, so it\u2019s not that I&nbsp;see it as a violation, but it\u2019s a bit much when you are having to explain your relationship with your flatmate to other women.</p> <p>Winter is approaching now, so it will get worse. It\u2019s cold, we\u2019ve got nowhere to hang our clothes and Harriet seems to do a wash every other day. There is literally no free space for me to hang my clothes up.</p> <p>I reckon Harriet\u2019s habits are bad for our central heating bills. She put the radiators on in early October, before it was even cold, just to dry her clothes. She has a drying rack but says things don\u2019t dry quickly enough and that it takes up space in her tiny room. Also, putting clothes over every&nbsp;radiator prevents the flat from&nbsp;fully warming up.</p> <p>My solution is to go to a launderette or split the cost of a tumble dryer, but Harriet won\u2019t hear of it. She says: \u201cI\u2019m&nbsp;not paying to dry my clothes!\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly uptight or unreasonable. I just don\u2019t love seeing Harriet\u2019s underwear all over the place. She could at least just dry that in her room. I think most people will agree with me.</p> <h2><strong>The defence: Harriet</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I don\u2019t have the money to&nbsp;buy a dryer, and there\u2019s not enough space in my&nbsp;tiny room</em></p> </blockquote> <p>We live in a small flat and we have to dry our clothes inside. It\u2019s not that controversial. If you don\u2019t have a garden, you don\u2019t have a choice.</p> <p>Drying clothes on the radiator doesn\u2019t affect its efficiency or how quickly the house heats up in the winter, and I\u2019m not paying to go to a launderette or saving up for a tumble dryer. I don\u2019t have the money.</p> <p>I don\u2019t see the issue with putting my&nbsp;underwear and other items on a&nbsp;radiator when there\u2019s very little space in our flat. Will is more easily embarrassed than me, so when we have guests he\u2019ll say: \u201cPut all those clothes in your room. The place looks messy.\u201d</p> <p>I always oblige but honestly, I&nbsp;otherwise wouldn\u2019t bother as I&nbsp;don\u2019t&nbsp;really care what people think. Sometimes it\u2019s our mutual friends. They have never, ever said anything about clothes drying on radiators. It\u2019s a normal sight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Drying clothes on the radiator doesn\u2019t affect how quickly the house heats up in the winter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the case of him bringing a date back, I get it. He wants the flat to look tidy and he also doesn\u2019t want them to think that I am his girlfriend. I thought the time I dried my bras and pants in Will\u2019s room while he had a girl over was pretty funny.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t get angry but after she left he said: \u201cCan you tell me in advance next time you\u2019re going to do that?\u201d It\u2019s&nbsp;fair enough. She had obviously thought it a bit weird, but I\u2019d done a really big wash and was desperate.</p> <p>The thing is, Will also hangs his clothes on our radiators, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly fair to ban me from doing it if he\u2019s not also going to&nbsp;stop. I don\u2019t tell him to hide his underwear, but he seems to have an&nbsp;aversion to looking at mine.</p> <p>I could dry those items in my room to make him comfortable, but I don\u2019t really like unfolding a big drying rack for that, as my room is really small. I&nbsp;do have a radiator in there, but there\u2019s not enough space for everything. I could try to use the drying rack for my underwear, but only as long as Will does the same. And seeing as his room is bigger than mine, maybe we could put the rack in his room. That sounds like a good compromise to me.</p> <h2>The jury of Guardian readers</h2> <p><strong>Should Harriet dry her underwear in&nbsp;her bedroom?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m #teamWill. Drying clothes around the house looks messy and definitely affects the efficiency of the central heating. And if it upsets Will, surely Harriet needs to be a bit more sensitive and compromise more?<br><strong>Andrew, 34</strong></p> <p>Will is being a bit lame about this. What\u2019s wrong with a few bras on the radiator? Is he frightened of women\u2019s panties? Sorry boys, but we do have to wear underwear and therefore it has to be washed and hung up to dry.<br><strong>Myrtle, 32</strong></p> <p>Harriet has crossed the line by putting her clothes on Will\u2019s radiator, but if you live in a shared flat you are entitled to dry your clothes in communal areas. If Will is annoyed and embarrassed, he should consider moving out. Otherwise, he should accept Harriet\u2019s compromise.<br><strong>Mike, 57</strong></p> <p>Will is blowing this out of proportion slightly, but I do think Harriet could be more considerate.

      "bodyText": "The prosecution: Will It\u2019s embarrassing seeing Harriet\u2019s bras and pants lying around the flat when people come over My mate Harriet lives with me in our shared rented flat. We\u2019re pretty close and have been since university, when we met on our history course. We work well together as flatmates. We moved in together two years ago but we are quite different. I\u2019m fairly organised and private, but Harriet loves to air her dirty laundry in public \u2013 literally. We have a tiny flat with no garden and a limited number of shared spaces, and Harriet is constantly drying her clothes on the radiators. I think this is embarrassing \u2013 especially when it\u2019s her underwear. It\u2019s not that I have a problem with seeing women\u2019s underwear, I just don\u2019t think it looks particularly inviting when we have people round. I have had girls I\u2019ve been seeing back at the house, and they have asked, \u201cWhose bras are these?\u201d because Harriet will sling them over every radiator. One time she even came into my room and put her stuff on my radiator. I\u2019d brought someone home with me, and it got awkward. We are close mates, so it\u2019s not that I see it as a violation, but it\u2019s a bit much when you are having to explain your relationship with your flatmate to other women. Winter is approaching now, so it will get worse. It\u2019s cold, we\u2019ve got nowhere to hang our clothes and Harriet seems to do a wash every other day. There is literally no free space for me to hang my clothes up. I reckon Harriet\u2019s habits are bad for our central heating bills. She put the radiators on in early October, before it was even cold, just to dry her clothes. She has a drying rack but says things don\u2019t dry quickly enough and that it takes up space in her tiny room. Also, putting clothes over every radiator prevents the flat from fully warming up. My solution is to go to a launderette or split the cost of a tumble dryer, but Harriet won\u2019t hear of it. She says: \u201cI\u2019m not paying to dry my clothes!\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly uptight or unreasonable. I just don\u2019t love seeing Harriet\u2019s underwear all over the place. She could at least just dry that in her room. I think most people will agree with me. The defence: Harriet I don\u2019t have the money to buy a dryer, and there\u2019s not enough space in my tiny room We live in a small flat and we have to dry our clothes inside. It\u2019s not that controversial. If you don\u2019t have a garden, you don\u2019t have a choice. Drying clothes on the radiator doesn\u2019t affect its efficiency or how quickly the house heats up in the winter, and I\u2019m not paying to go to a launderette or saving up for a tumble dryer. I don\u2019t have the money. I don\u2019t see the issue with putting my underwear and other items on a radiator when there\u2019s very little space in our flat. Will is more easily embarrassed than me, so when we have guests he\u2019ll say: \u201cPut all those clothes in your room. The place looks messy.\u201d I always oblige but honestly, I otherwise wouldn\u2019t bother as I don\u2019t really care what people think. Sometimes it\u2019s our mutual friends. They have never, ever said anything about clothes drying on radiators. It\u2019s a normal sight. In the case of him bringing a date back, I get it. He wants the flat to look tidy and he also doesn\u2019t want them to think that I am his girlfriend. I thought the time I dried my bras and pants in Will\u2019s room while he had a girl over was pretty funny. He didn\u2019t get angry but after she left he said: \u201cCan you tell me in advance next time you\u2019re going to do that?\u201d It\u2019s fair enough. She had obviously thought it a bit weird, but I\u2019d done a really big wash and was desperate. The thing is, Will also hangs his clothes on our radiators, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly fair to ban me from doing it if he\u2019s not also going to stop. I don\u2019t tell him to hide his underwear, but he seems to have an aversion to looking at mine. I could dry those items in my room to make him comfortable, but I don\u2019t really like unfolding a big drying rack for that, as my room is really small. I do have a radiator in there, but there\u2019s not enough space for everything. I could try to use the drying rack for my underwear, but only as long as Will does the same. And seeing as his room is bigger than mine, maybe we could put the rack in his room. That sounds like a good compromise to me. The jury of Guardian readers Should Harriet dry her underwear in her bedroom? I\u2019m #teamWill. Drying clothes around the house looks messy and definitely affects the efficiency of the central heating. And if it upsets Will, surely Harriet needs to be a bit more sensitive and compromise more? Andrew, 34 Will is being a bit lame about this. What\u2019s wrong with a few bras on the radiator? Is he frightened of women\u2019s panties? Sorry boys, but we do have to wear underwear and therefore it has to be washed and hung up to dry. Myrtle, 32 Harriet has crossed the line by putting her clothes on Will\u2019s radiator, but if you live in a shared flat you are entitled to dry your clothes in communal areas. If Will is annoyed and embarrassed, he should consider moving out. Otherwise, he should accept Harriet\u2019s compromise. Mike, 57 Will is blowing this out of proportion slightly, but I do think Harriet could be more considerate. Also, she shouldn\u2019t be doing so many washes \u2013 they\u2019re bad for the environment and the heating bill. A compromise needs to be found here: one underwear wash a week, so the radiators aren\u2019t constantly heaving with pants. Alicia, 43 Why is it so hard for Will to explain to his dates that he lives with a female flatmate? It would be ridiculous to pay for a laundrette just to save Will\u2019s blushes, and tumble-dryers are wildly expensive. Robert, 47 Now you be the judge In our online poll, tell us: should Harriet stop leaving her underwear hanging around? The poll closes on Thursday 31 October at 10am GMT Last week\u2019s result We asked if Polly should give more attention to her boyfriend and less to their new cat. 21% of you said Polly is guilty 79% of you said Polly is innocent",

It at times feels like a screenwriting exercise, for mostly better rather than worse, as they find creative ways to write themselves in and out of precarious situations. Iris\u2019s hellish day includes tackling a fast-moving river, communicating with a kindly stranger and escaping a growing fire, and while the rules of what part of her body does and doesn\u2019t work at any given moment might often feel loose, it\u2019s hard not to get wrapped up in the nightmarish escalation of it all. There\u2019s some real suspense here and the pace, given the brisk runtime, rarely flags although an overlong and overwritten sequence involving a good samaritan could have benefited from a tightening, the film\u2019s grip starting to weaken as it progresses.

      "bodyText": "There are many, many reasons to go back and rewatch Robert Zemeckis\u2019s sleek 2000 thriller What Lies Beneath, his state-of-the-art stab at a Hitchcock. The timely autumnal atmosphere, the idyllic built-for-the-movie house, the two glamorous older stars, the one shock subversion of type and then there\u2019s the horribly effective and highly ingenious suspense set piece involving a bathtub. Michelle Pfeiffer, in what was her last major studio lead performance, is trapped, paralysed by an experimental drug as water is rising. With Zemeckis and longtime cinematographer Don Burgess at their most playful, we follow her body shutting down and then in brief spurts, flashes of life, a struggle to survive using only random, unpredictable movements. It\u2019s a bravura sequence and one that was undoubtedly somewhere in the minds of the writers TJ Cimfel and David White as they came up with punchy, pre-Halloween Netflix chiller Don\u2019t Move. It\u2019s an extension of that unpleasant idea to an 85-minute runtime as a woman fights for her life while dealing with the effects of paralysis. Iris (Kelsey Asbille) is a grieving mother who becomes the latest target of a demented serial killer (Finn Wittrock), whom she meets in a remote forest when he pretends that he too is struggling with a major loss. But it\u2019s a manipulative trap to lure her in before he injects a drug that will paralyse her, kicking off a desperate fight for survival as her body shuts down. Cimfel and White, working with the director duo Adam Schindler and Brian Netto underneath the overseeing eye of the esteemed producer Sam Raimi, have given themselves an incredibly difficult task, to centre an entire film on a protagonist whose movements are increasingly restricted at best. It at times feels like a screenwriting exercise, for mostly better rather than worse, as they find creative ways to write themselves in and out of precarious situations. Iris\u2019s hellish day includes tackling a fast-moving river, communicating with a kindly stranger and escaping a growing fire, and while the rules of what part of her body does and doesn\u2019t work at any given moment might often feel loose, it\u2019s hard not to get wrapped up in the nightmarish escalation of it all. There\u2019s some real suspense here and the pace, given the brisk runtime, rarely flags although an overlong and overwritten sequence involving a good samaritan could have benefited from a tightening, the film\u2019s grip starting to weaken as it progresses. The film is at its best when words are secondary to action. Asbille is saddled with a difficult task of her own \u2013 a mostly dialogue-free performance relying on vital finger and eye acting \u2013 and it\u2019s sadly not one that she\u2019s able to convincingly pull off. Her journey from paralysed by grief to literally paralysed to final girl fighting back doesn\u2019t have enough energy or emotion to it with a low-level flatness that follows her even when she is in full control of her body (it doesn\u2019t help that her last-act fuck-you quips are a little underpowered regardless of how she performs them).

Ahead of the anticipated tax rises, the government has come under pressure to clarify its manifesto promise to \u201cnot increase taxes on working people\u201d. Asked whether someone who works but also has an income from assets, such as shares and property, was a working person, Starmer told Sky News: \u201cWell, they wouldn\u2019t come within my definition.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson later clarified that he was referring to people who \u201cprimarily get their income from assets\u201d and was \u201cnot precluding people that have a small amount of savings\u201d in stocks and shares.

Starmer has indicated that CGT on the sale of shares and other assets, currently set at up to 20%, will increase. The tax is expected to rise by several percentage points. However, ministers are expected to leave CGT on the sale of property untouched because of concerns that increasing it would cost money by slowing down sales. The Conservatives cut the top rate of CGT for property from 28% to 24% in the last budget. Reeves is also looking at tightening the rules for inheritance and gift tax. Only about one in 20 UK estates now attract inheritance tax. On Friday, James Murray, a Treasury minister, refused to be drawn on whether a landlord would be considered a \u201cworking person\u201d for the purposes of Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge not to increase tax on \u201cworking people\u201d. \u201cWorking people are people who go out to work for their income,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe were very clear in our manifesto.\u201d Asked repeatedly if a landlord was a working person, after Starmer said a person whose income derived from assets, such as shares or property would not \u201ccome within my definition\u201d of a working person, Murray said: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about where people get their income.\u201d Murray insisted any changes to fiscal rules would be in line with what the Labour party said in its manifesto.",

      "body": "<p>In 1960, Oliver Sacks, a 27-year-old University of Oxford graduate, arrived in San Francisco by Greyhound bus. Born in Cricklewood, London, Sacks spent the better part of his 20s training to be a doctor, but came to feel that English academic medicine was stifling and stratified. A \u201ctight and tedious\u201d professional ladder, he thought, was the only one available to aspiring neurologists like him.</p> <p>A young queer man with a growing interest in motorcycle leather, Sacks had other reasons to leave. The revelation of his sexuality had caused a family rift: his mother felt it made him an \u201cabomination\u201d. And so he looked for escape across the Atlantic. America, for him, was the wide open west of Ansel Adams photographs; California was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/25/cannery-row-sentimental-shallow-john-steinbeck\">Steinbeck\u2019s Cannery Row</a><em>. </em>The new world promised \u201cspace, freedom, interstices in which I could live and work\u201d. This is how we meet Oliver Sacks in Letters: as an immigrant undertaking an internship at Mount Zion hospital, the first step in a career on US soil that would span another five decades.</p> <p>Sacks\u2019s San Francisco years also marked the beginning of his life as a writer. The city wasn\u2019t an arbitrary choice. As he eagerly confessed to a one-time lover, Jen\u00f6 Vincze, his true motivation for travelling to California was to force a meeting with an artistic idol, the British-turned-Haight Ashbury poet, Thom Gunn. Gunn\u2019s The Sense of Movement (1957) spoke to and stirred Sacks\u2019s predilection for motorbikes. Moreover, it performed on Sacks the kind of private miracle only poetry can: it helped decode \u201cthe babble\u201d of his emotional life. \u201cThere is a queer, colossally big London Jew called Wolf,\u201d Gunn wrote to his partner in 1961, after first meeting Sacks (who used his middle name, Wolf, as a <em>nom de guerre </em>when frequenting the city\u2019s gay bars, wise to its lycanthropic resonances). \u201c[He] came out to be a doctor here because I live here.\u201d Sacks shared his writing with Gunn, whom he found a ruthless but tender critic, later crediting the poet with first impressing on him that he had real literary talent; a pivotal moment for a man who would go on to publish a dozen books.</p> <p>\u201cI am not a good correspondent,\u201d Sacks wrote to his parents in 1961, \u201cbecause I speak and write <em>at </em>people rather than to them.\u201d This is an apt summation of Letters: 52 years of outgoing mail sent (or left unsent) to family, friends, scientists, writers and later, fans and celebrities, a panoply of addressees as diverse as the subjects Sacks writes \u201cat\u201d them about. Unleashed in a self-described \u201cvolcanic logorrhoea\u201d that typifies his writing style, these letters variously consider botany, etymology, entomology, geology, neurology, and literature; the tussle between xenophobia and xeniality in Star Trek; the \u201cphantasmagoric-comic unconscious\u201d of actor Robin Williams. Edited by Kate Edgar, who worked as Sacks\u2019s editorial assistant for over 20 years, Letters<em> </em>represents a mere fraction of the total in his archives, which runs to more than 200,000 pages.</p> <p>Many of the included letters are incomplete, with ellipses denoting gaps whose editorial logic we must take on faith, even when they occasionally appear to interrupt tantalising trains of thought. In a 1984 letter to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/dec/31/society.art\">Lawrence Weschler</a>, for instance, Sacks\u2019s conflicted reflections on strike action in hospitals that might put vulnerable patients at risk feel prematurely curtailed. Despite these excisions, Letters leaves one with the overwhelming impression of a brilliant and vivid mind, a man whose intellectual appetite was vast, and whose professional and creative passions \u2013 far from being the self-absorbed obsessions of a pedant \u2013 were first and foremost an act of reaching out, the means through which he sought to communicate with others, a \u201clove affair with the world\u201d.</p> <p>Sacks is an endearing and entertaining prose stylist \u2013 inquisitive, often funny, never obtuse \u2013 and the organisation of Letters, separated into broadly thematic, chronological chapters with concise editorial introductions, provides narrative momentum. The resulting book is far more engaging than the unwieldy reference text for Sacks specialists it could have been. It might, in fact, serve as a more affecting autobiography than his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/08/on-the-move-a-life-oliver-sacks-review-autobiography-neurologist\">On the Move</a><em> </em>(2015), which occasionally slides into sentimentality. Letters is crammed with off-the-cuff profundities, moments of elevated perception that briefly unriddle the more inscrutable aspects of human nature. Here he is on grief, after the passing of his mother in 1972, an emotive state he deems \u201cso unlike depression: it is so filling and real and expanding and uniting and \u2013 (it sounds an almost blasphemous word) \u2013 nourishing\u201d.</p> <p>Letters also draws an illuminating line from Sacks\u2019s neurological career to his unlikely emergence as a bestselling author. In the late 60s, having relocated to New York, Sacks treated a group of patients suffering from encephalitis lethargica, also known as \u201csleeping sickness\u201d, with an experimental drug, L-dopa. This experience informed his second book, Awakenings<em> </em>(1973), which married scientific research with storytelling through case studies of his patients\u2019 lives and their responses to the treatment \u2013 a hybrid genre that irritated his colleagues just as it struck a chord with general readers. The literary attention Awakenings received set Sacks on a course to public renown.</p> <p>\u201cBrevity has never been a quality of mine,\u201d he wrote to Mrs Miller, a physical therapist who helped him regain&nbsp;mobility after a leg injury in 1974. Indeed superabundance \u2013 the instinct toward<em> excess </em>\u2013 is everywhere in these letters. As a man of 30, dallying with powerlifting, Sacks routinely bragged to his parents about his weight, how much he could lift, the amount he ate \u2013 \u201cI love to shake the pavement as I walk, to part crowds like the prow of a ship.\u201d At Mount Zion, special scrubs had to be made to accommodate his bulk, and he found himself in disfavour with his superiors for stealing patients\u2019 food.</p> <p>But his overconsumption wasn\u2019t always dietary. During the following 10 years or so, Sacks took a prodigious amount of amphetamines and psychotropics \u2013 \u201cevery dose an overdose\u201d \u2013 with one trip producing visions of the \u201cneurological heavens\u201d so intense it inspired him to write his first book, Migraine (1970). By the 80s, following Awakenings<em> </em>and an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show that boosted his profile, pumping iron and popping pills had been replaced by correspondence. \u201cI receive at least fifty or sixty letters and phone-calls a day,\u201d he told his father with the same pride he formerly felt after squatting 575lb, \u201cand, if anything, this number is <em>increasing</em>!\u201d</p> <p>What was Sacks trying to satiate? His substance abuse, the workaholism that eventually displaced it, speaks of the addict\u2019s need to fill or stuff a void, an effort to forestall the unbearable loneliness that might accompany a moment\u2019s rest. And loneliness certainly runs through these pages. Sacks once felt that his very existence was only made tolerable by rejecting intimacy and becoming \u201cimpersonal or supra-personal\u201d; relationships, he said, were a forbidden area for him.</p> <p>Late in life, he cited internalised homophobia as the driving force behind this isolation, a heart-rending admission, given that he temporarily felt liberated from this oppressive \u201csocial matrix\u201d during that short-lived 1965 love affair with Jen\u00f6. It wasn\u2019t until 2008, after 30-odd years\u2019 celibacy, that an epistolary meet-cute with the writer Bill Hayes precipitated a loving, intimate&nbsp;companionship, one that would last the&nbsp;remainder of Sacks\u2019s life. It\u2019s a touching if bittersweet moment that arrives towards the end of Letters, the coda to this portrait of a man who, half a century earlier, had travelled across the world hoping to meet a poet&nbsp;who&nbsp;might truly understand him.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ralf Webb is the author of Strange Relations: Masculinity, Sexuality and Art in Mid-Century America (Sceptre, \u00a320).

      "bodyText": "In 1960, Oliver Sacks, a 27-year-old University of Oxford graduate, arrived in San Francisco by Greyhound bus. Born in Cricklewood, London, Sacks spent the better part of his 20s training to be a doctor, but came to feel that English academic medicine was stifling and stratified. A \u201ctight and tedious\u201d professional ladder, he thought, was the only one available to aspiring neurologists like him. A young queer man with a growing interest in motorcycle leather, Sacks had other reasons to leave. The revelation of his sexuality had caused a family rift: his mother felt it made him an \u201cabomination\u201d. And so he looked for escape across the Atlantic. America, for him, was the wide open west of Ansel Adams photographs; California was Steinbeck\u2019s Cannery Row. The new world promised \u201cspace, freedom, interstices in which I could live and work\u201d. This is how we meet Oliver Sacks in Letters: as an immigrant undertaking an internship at Mount Zion hospital, the first step in a career on US soil that would span another five decades. Sacks\u2019s San Francisco years also marked the beginning of his life as a writer. The city wasn\u2019t an arbitrary choice. As he eagerly confessed to a one-time lover, Jen\u00f6 Vincze, his true motivation for travelling to California was to force a meeting with an artistic idol, the British-turned-Haight Ashbury poet, Thom Gunn. Gunn\u2019s The Sense of Movement (1957) spoke to and stirred Sacks\u2019s predilection for motorbikes. Moreover, it performed on Sacks the kind of private miracle only poetry can: it helped decode \u201cthe babble\u201d of his emotional life. \u201cThere is a queer, colossally big London Jew called Wolf,\u201d Gunn wrote to his partner in 1961, after first meeting Sacks (who used his middle name, Wolf, as a nom de guerre when frequenting the city\u2019s gay bars, wise to its lycanthropic resonances). \u201c[He] came out to be a doctor here because I live here.\u201d Sacks shared his writing with Gunn, whom he found a ruthless but tender critic, later crediting the poet with first impressing on him that he had real literary talent; a pivotal moment for a man who would go on to publish a dozen books. \u201cI am not a good correspondent,\u201d Sacks wrote to his parents in 1961, \u201cbecause I speak and write at people rather than to them.\u201d This is an apt summation of Letters: 52 years of outgoing mail sent (or left unsent) to family, friends, scientists, writers and later, fans and celebrities, a panoply of addressees as diverse as the subjects Sacks writes \u201cat\u201d them about. Unleashed in a self-described \u201cvolcanic logorrhoea\u201d that typifies his writing style, these letters variously consider botany, etymology, entomology, geology, neurology, and literature; the tussle between xenophobia and xeniality in Star Trek; the \u201cphantasmagoric-comic unconscious\u201d of actor Robin Williams. Edited by Kate Edgar, who worked as Sacks\u2019s editorial assistant for over 20 years, Letters represents a mere fraction of the total in his archives, which runs to more than 200,000 pages. Many of the included letters are incomplete, with ellipses denoting gaps whose editorial logic we must take on faith, even when they occasionally appear to interrupt tantalising trains of thought. In a 1984 letter to Lawrence Weschler, for instance, Sacks\u2019s conflicted reflections on strike action in hospitals that might put vulnerable patients at risk feel prematurely curtailed. Despite these excisions, Letters leaves one with the overwhelming impression of a brilliant and vivid mind, a man whose intellectual appetite was vast, and whose professional and creative passions \u2013 far from being the self-absorbed obsessions of a pedant \u2013 were first and foremost an act of reaching out, the means through which he sought to communicate with others, a \u201clove affair with the world\u201d. Sacks is an endearing and entertaining prose stylist \u2013 inquisitive, often funny, never obtuse \u2013 and the organisation of Letters, separated into broadly thematic, chronological chapters with concise editorial introductions, provides narrative momentum. The resulting book is far more engaging than the unwieldy reference text for Sacks specialists it could have been. It might, in fact, serve as a more affecting autobiography than his On the Move (2015), which occasionally slides into sentimentality. Letters is crammed with off-the-cuff profundities, moments of elevated perception that briefly unriddle the more inscrutable aspects of human nature. Here he is on grief, after the passing of his mother in 1972, an emotive state he deems \u201cso unlike depression: it is so filling and real and expanding and uniting and \u2013 (it sounds an almost blasphemous word) \u2013 nourishing\u201d. Letters also draws an illuminating line from Sacks\u2019s neurological career to his unlikely emergence as a bestselling author. In the late 60s, having relocated to New York, Sacks treated a group of patients suffering from encephalitis lethargica, also known as \u201csleeping sickness\u201d, with an experimental drug, L-dopa. This experience informed his second book, Awakenings (1973), which married scientific research with storytelling through case studies of his patients\u2019 lives and their responses to the treatment \u2013 a hybrid genre that irritated his colleagues just as it struck a chord with general readers. The literary attention Awakenings received set Sacks on a course to public renown. \u201cBrevity has never been a quality of mine,\u201d he wrote to Mrs Miller, a physical therapist who helped him regain mobility after a leg injury in 1974. Indeed superabundance \u2013 the instinct toward excess \u2013 is everywhere in these letters. As a man of 30, dallying with powerlifting, Sacks routinely bragged to his parents about his weight, how much he could lift, the amount he ate \u2013 \u201cI love to shake the pavement as I walk, to part crowds like the prow of a ship.\u201d At Mount Zion, special scrubs had to be made to accommodate his bulk, and he found himself in disfavour with his superiors for stealing patients\u2019 food. But his overconsumption wasn\u2019t always dietary. During the following 10 years or so, Sacks took a prodigious amount of amphetamines and psychotropics \u2013 \u201cevery dose an overdose\u201d \u2013 with one trip producing visions of the \u201cneurological heavens\u201d so intense it inspired him to write his first book, Migraine (1970). By the 80s, following Awakenings and an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show that boosted his profile, pumping iron and popping pills had been replaced by correspondence. \u201cI receive at least fifty or sixty letters and phone-calls a day,\u201d he told his father with the same pride he formerly felt after squatting 575lb, \u201cand, if anything, this number is increasing!\u201d What was Sacks trying to satiate? His substance abuse, the workaholism that eventually displaced it, speaks of the addict\u2019s need to fill or stuff a void, an effort to forestall the unbearable loneliness that might accompany a moment\u2019s rest. And loneliness certainly runs through these pages. Sacks once felt that his very existence was only made tolerable by rejecting intimacy and becoming \u201cimpersonal or supra-personal\u201d; relationships, he said, were a forbidden area for him. Late in life, he cited internalised homophobia as the driving force behind this isolation, a heart-rending admission, given that he temporarily felt liberated from this oppressive \u201csocial matrix\u201d during that short-lived 1965 love affair with Jen\u00f6. It wasn\u2019t until 2008, after 30-odd years\u2019 celibacy, that an epistolary meet-cute with the writer Bill Hayes precipitated a loving, intimate companionship, one that would last the remainder of Sacks\u2019s life. It\u2019s a touching if bittersweet moment that arrives towards the end of Letters, the coda to this portrait of a man who, half a century earlier, had travelled across the world hoping to meet a poet who might truly understand him.

It was a rare moment in Spain\u2019s parliament. Migration has not been a prominent or deeply partisan issue in Spain\u2019s national arena until recently, and the Spanish government\u2019s stance has largely mirrored that of other European governments in pushing against irregular migration.

He was refused police bail and is due to appear at Fairfield local court today.</p> \n  <p>Two missing persons appeals were issued for Dobbin after he was last spotted at Leppington, about 80km from where the search for his body was taking place, early on the morning of 25 September.</p> \n  <p>On Friday afternoon police said that while the body is yet to be formally identified, it is believed to be Dobbin.</p> \n  <p>A postmortem examination will be conducted to confirm the cause of the man\u2019s death and a report will be prepared for the coroner.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T06:00:05.750Z\">at 7.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671b24998f08791c139f7272\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T05:17:12.683Z\">6.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Australia and UK announce new climate and energy deal</strong></p> \n  <p>Australia and the United Kingdom have struck a new deal to tackle climate change and collaborate on energy initiatives at a meeting between the nations\u2019 leaders.</p> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> met with <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> for the first time on the sidelines of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in Apia, Samoa.</p> \n  <p>The climate and energy partnership was announced on Friday, focusing on the \u201caccelerated\u201d development of renewable energy like offshore wind and green hydrogen through shared cooperation.</p> \n  <p>A joint statement referenced no specific initiatives, instead focusing on net zero emissions targets set by both nations.</p> \n  <p>Starmer said Australia and the UK shared many things in common.

Here\u2019s a summary of the main news developments: Technology company WiseTech Global enjoyed a double-digit surge in its share price on Friday after its embattled founder, Richard White, stood aside, creating a circuit breaker to weeks of damaging news. The Queensland Liberal National party leader, David Crisafulli, has walked back his campaign promise to resign if crime victim numbers do not reduce under a government led by him, claiming on Friday that he was referring to per capita rates, and not the overall number of victims. No-grounds evictions have been outlawed in New South Wales with the passing of new laws designed to rebalance power between the state\u2019s 2.2 million renters and their landlords. A high-profile Sydney man has been found not guilty on two counts of rape, with a jury unable to reach a verdict on three other rape charges. An \u201camorous couple\u201d accused of causing major flooding and the evacuation of two Victorian train stations has been arrested. A sacked Melbourne Victory women\u2019s coach has been jailed and may be deported after raping a woman who screamed for him to stop. Thanks for reading \u2013 have a pleasant evening. Police find body amid inquiries into missing man Police in New South Wales have located a man\u2019s body after an extensive search in the Hawkesbury region on Friday, as a man remains before the courts charged with murder. Authorities allege Edwin Dobbin, 82, was shot dead some time after he disappeared from south-west Sydney in late September. Nearly a month later, detectives charged a 67-year-old man with killing Dobbin and disposing of his body. The accused killer, who police said knew Dobbin, was arrested at a home in Smithfield yesterday after allegedly telling authorities conflicting accounts of the elderly man\u2019s disappearance. After the arrest, police began searching a semi-rural property north-west of Sydney, where they believe Dobbin\u2019s body is buried. Authorities said they would continue the search for his remains today. The accused man was also charged with hindering an investigation into a serious indictable offence and the unlawful disposal of a corpse. He was refused police bail and is due to appear at Fairfield local court today. Two missing persons appeals were issued for Dobbin after he was last spotted at Leppington, about 80km from where the search for his body was taking place, early on the morning of 25 September. On Friday afternoon police said that while the body is yet to be formally identified, it is believed to be Dobbin. A postmortem examination will be conducted to confirm the cause of the man\u2019s death and a report will be prepared for the coroner. Australia and UK announce new climate and energy deal Australia and the United Kingdom have struck a new deal to tackle climate change and collaborate on energy initiatives at a meeting between the nations\u2019 leaders. Anthony Albanese met with Keir Starmer for the first time on the sidelines of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in Apia, Samoa. The climate and energy partnership was announced on Friday, focusing on the \u201caccelerated\u201d development of renewable energy like offshore wind and green hydrogen through shared cooperation. A joint statement referenced no specific initiatives, instead focusing on net zero emissions targets set by both nations. Starmer said Australia and the UK shared many things in common. He said: This partnership underscores our commitment to powering up the UK with clean energy projects that will benefit communities across the country. Together, we\u2019re delivering better futures for our two countries, whether that\u2019s through protecting our national security with projects like Aukus or delivering on our net zero commitments.\u201d Albanese said: This partnership will ensure we maximise the economic potential of the net zero transition, and build on our long-standing cooperation on international climate action and shared commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. We share a vision for a modern and transformed Australia-United Kingdom relationship, which delivers tangible benefits and prosperity to both our nations and the Indo-Pacific.\u201d Other discussions between the two leaders revolved around the Australia-UK free trade agreement, security and stability across the Indo-Pacific and negotiations for a bilateral treaty announced in September to develop the SSN-Aukus submarine for both nations. The biennial meeting is being hosted by the Samoan prime minister, Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata\u02bbafa, and is expected to focus heavily on regional security and tackling climate change. King Charles addressed the gathering on Thursday. \u2013 PA Reserve Bank posts annual loss of $4.2bn The RBA\u2019s own finances aren\u2019t that rosy, at least on paper. It clocked up another annual loss of $4.2bn, mostly because its liabilities increase along with the cash rate but the returns on many of its assets remain fixed at the record low rates of 2020 and 2021. Still, that shortfall was better than the $6bn lost in the previous year. It also has negative equity of $20.4bn, or about 15.3% more than for the 2022-23 year. Positive equity is not forecast until about 2030 (and a lot can change before then): \u201cNegative equity does not affect our operations or ability to perform our policy functions, but the Reserve Bank Board considers it important that the RBA\u2019s capital be restored over time,\u201d the governor, Michele Bullock, said in a foreword to the report. The RBA has historically paid a lot of profit to governments \u2013 a tradition we don\u2019t expect to see revived for a while. As for the bit borrowers probably care about, Bullock indicated interest rate cuts aren\u2019t likely to come in a rush (short of some major calamity, presumably). She said: Inflation remained high in 2023/24, and we expect that it will take another year or two before it is sustainably back to the Reserve Bank Board\u2019s target of between 2 and 3%. [The RBA board] recognises the challenging task it faces in bringing inflation back to target in a reasonable timeframe while preserving as many of the gains in the labour market as possible\u201d. Inflation figures for the September quarter, though, will land next Wednesday. A benign set of numbers (not out of the question) will stoke hopes of interest rate cuts before the RBA gets to sign off on another annual report. RBA governor\u2019s remuneration tops $1.25m The Reserve Bank has released its annual report for the 2023-24 year, with the usual array of titbits. The tabloids may jump on the remuneration details to contrast with mortgage-holders\u2019 pain. Michele Bullock, who became governor about one-quarter of the way into the financial year, collected a base salary of $811,108 for the time spent at the top. That came on top of $179,098 earned as deputy governor for part of the year. All up, including superannuation and her package being \u201cinflated by her accrued long service leave being revalued\u201d after her promotion, Bullock\u2019s remuneration totalled $1,262,215 \u2013 or about 52% more than she earned a year earlier. That package was also a touch over 10% more than her predecessor, Philip Lowe, earned in his final year before being punted. Lowe\u2019s final months, during the 2023-24 financial year, generated him remuneration of $261,940. It looks like a lot of money, but it pales against the income of many top CEOs \u2013 and probably quite a few people who are good at kicking or hitting balls \u2013 and the RBA is arguably Australia\u2019s most important financial institution. (Please send any correspondence to the RBA.) Cannabis crop worth $26m set alight in Victoria More than $26m worth of cannabis has been destroyed after Victorian police arrested five people in one of the state\u2019s largest drug busts of its kind. Major Drug Squad detectives and local police swooped on a rural property in Leongatha South, in the state\u2019s south-east, where they uncovered 6,525 cannabis plants. The discovery inside several commercial-sized hothouses on Tuesday included cannabis seedlings through to mature-sized plants, weighing 1.7 tonnes in total. The bust was \u201cone of the most significant and complex\u201d hydroponic cannabis set-ups the force had seen in recent times, Victoria police Acting Inspector Leemara Fairgrieve said on Friday. \u201cThere were various other buildings on the property so in various locations within that property there was pretty much plants everywhere,\u201d she told reporters. It took more than 15 officers three days to dismantle and remove all the plants from the property, with water, electricity and dams part of the well-co-ordinated and methodical set-up. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time and a very dirty and smelly job ... it\u2019s a really hard, arduous job for the members and then at the end, all of the items were destroyed out at the property,\u201d Fairgrieve said. AAP Technology company WiseTech Global enjoyed a double-digit surge in its share price on Friday after its embattled founder Richard White stood aside, creating a circuit breaker to weeks of damaging news. Shares jumped almost 20% before retracing to trade at the $113 mark by early afternoon, representing a 14% rise. WiseTech announced after the market closed yesterday that White would stand down as chief executive \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d. After a short period of leave, White will return in a consulting role for a 10-year term with the title \u201cfounder and founding CEO\u201d. His $1m annual pay packet will remain unchanged. The company has started a search for a new CEO. White has been under extreme pressure after weeks of damaging revelations about his personal life. The company\u2019s shares were trading at as high as $137 at the start of the month before the revelations spooked shareholders. RBC Capital Markets analyst Garry Sherriff said in a note today that the leadership transition represented a \u201cpositive circuit breaker\u201d. Many thanks for joining me on today\u2019s blog. Elias Visontay will take you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care and enjoy your weekend. Stolen antique guns found after being made operational Part of a horde of antique handguns stolen from a community-run museum has been recovered after the weapons were modified to become operational, AAP reports. Police searched a property in Nowra on the NSW south coast this morning and seized more than a dozen firearms as well as 10,000 rounds of ammunition. They also took custody of a 3D printer and printed firearm parts, $64,700 in cash, 2.3kg of cannabis, and a buggy and two motocross bikes believed to be stolen. Two men, aged 25 and 29, were arrested and each charged with more than 20 firearms offences. Police believe six of the seized guns were stolen from the Lithgow Small Arms Factory in August. The men were refused bail to appear before Nowra local court today. Three other men were arrested and charged with the theft in September, when they were accused of stealing 27 commemorative guns from the museum for a profit-driven heist. The weapons included one from the 1700s and a pistol gifted by the Sultan of Oman. Detectives were told the handguns, worth more than $200,000, could be made operational with modifications. Some of the guns might have been sold to \u201cunwitting\u201d members of the public, police said previously. People would not face prosecution if they turned in the weapons to a registered firearms dealer or police station, investigators said. The six guns seized in the latest raid had all been made operational, while another eight stolen weapons remain unaccounted for. Map of areas with severe heatwave warning As we flagged earlier, there are heatwave warnings in place for parts of the NT, WA and Queensland today. The Bureau of Meteorology has published this video, demonstrating which areas are impacted: Victoria police provide update on fatal truck crash Detective Sergeant Stephen Hill addressed the media earlier this afternoon after a truck crashed into a house in regional Victoria and left two dead. He said the truck went through the front bedroom of the house, which is currently quarantined due to some asbestos issues. It appears both victims were in the front bedroom at the time. At least one, I believe, was sleeping at the time. The other one doesn\u2019t appear to be. Hill said a number of vehicles were on the road when this occurred and called triple zero after being \u201cwitnesses to the traumatic events that occurred this morning\u201d. It\u2019s a pretty dead-straight road. There\u2019s no reason for vehicles to swerve, unless they\u2019re overtaking. But how and why and what was going on inside the truck that caused the collision is something we will just have to look at over time. \u2018Stay informed\u2019 fire warnings for Queensland communities amid increased danger rating Earlier we flagged there was a high fire danger rating for large parts of Queensland today. The state\u2019s fire department has issued \u201cstay informed\u201d warnings for three communities: Mutchilba (near Mareeba) between Algoma Road, Mareeba Dimbulah Road and Springmount Road Canaga (near Chinchilla) between Southern Boundary Road, Davis Road, Woods Roads, Blowers Road and Pit Road Dalby between Wilds Road, Warrego Highway, Newtown Stephen Road, Duncans Road and Ritters Road The department said there is no immediate danger for these communities, but they should say informed \u201cbecause conditions could change\u201d. Miles taking questions ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Queensland election The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, took some questions from reporters on the Gold Coast earlier, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s election. He was asked to respond to today\u2019s Newspoll, showing that Labor was gaining momentum: I think what we\u2019ve seen is a continuing trend across the polls that, as Queenslanders get more of a chance to see and learn about [LNP leader] David Crisafulli, the more questions they have, the less they like him. That\u2019s what has been borne out here. If Labor is unsuccessful at the polls this weekend, would Miles stay on as opposition leader? He responded that these are \u201cquestions for Sunday and beyond\u201d. Miles also repeated earlier comments throughout the day that Labor doesn\u2019t intend to do any deals with the Greens and Katters: The LNP can\u2019t make the same commitment. They have \u2026 a preference deal with the Katters already, they have a deal with Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation. Imagine how madcap that coalition would be \u2013 David Crisafulli, Jarrod Bleijie, Robbie Katter and Pauline Hanson. That\u2019s what they\u2019re proposing. Qantas has avoided a spill of its board of directors, after investors voted in favour of its proposed executive pay plan. A spill resolution would have been put to vote had investors voted down the remuneration plan at today\u2019s annual general meeting in Hobart, after investors delivered a spectacular rejection of the pay deal at last year\u2019s AGM in what was seen as a protest of a series of scandals that led to the early exit of former CEO Alan Joyce. However, the remuneration report resolution has received overwhelming support. The improved sentiment from shareholders has come amid a more than 60% rise in share price since last year\u2019s AGM. Despite avoiding the damaging second strike against executive pay, Qantas\u2019 new board chair, John Mullen, faced a series of questions from frustrated investors who felt that the leaders and directors of the company who remain from the tumultuous Joyce era had not sufficiently explained why they allowed certain decisions to be made. Mullen also defended against a suggestion from an investor that Joyce\u2019s final pay packet \u2013 which had already been cut by $9.3m following a review which found considerable harm was done to the Qantas brand under his tenure \u2013 should be clawed back even further to just his base salary. A resolution to allow new CEO Vanessa Hudson to participate in Qantas\u2019 long-term incentive program \u2013 which include long-term bonuses on top of base pay for meeting KPIs \u2013 was also supported. Defence Net Zero Strategy released The Defence Net Zero Strategy has been unveiled, setting out \u201cpractical and sensible\u201d ways of reducing the environmental impact and carbon emissions of the government\u2019s largest landholder and energy user, Pat Conroy has said. As AAP reports, the defence industry minister said this includes using more renewable electricity, changing to lower-emission fuels, increasing energy efficiency, and investigating carbon sequestration on defence land. The challenges arising from climate change are recognised in the National Defence Strategy and defence is taking action \u2026 Action on climate change is part of the defence mission to defend Australia and its national interests. The defence secretary, Greg Moriarty, said the sector must demonstrate leadership in the transition away from fossil fuels and develop its own energy production capabilities, which would also boost national energy security. Alternate energy sources that are wholly generated in Australia through sovereign capabilities are highly attractive to defence. The strategy was described as the \u201cfirst step\u201d in maintaining capability and interoperability, while contributing to the federal government\u2019s decarbonisation commitments. But conventional fossil fuels were expected to remain part of the military\u2019s energy mix beyond 2050, albeit at a reduced proportion, it said. Save the Children Australia welcomes $10m in aid for Lebanon but urges more Save the Children Australia has welcomed the government\u2019s announcement of a further $10m in humanitarian aid for civilians in Lebanon (see earlier post for more details). In a statement, its head of humanitarian and global programs Melanie Book said the $10m is a \u201cwelcome further step\u201d towards helping a country \u201calready stricken by a severe humanitarian crisis driven by economic collapse and political instability, even before the recent escalation of the conflict\u201d. Children in Lebanon have felt the crushing anxiety of war for months, and now their worst nightmare has become a reality, with 2,467 people killed, including 127 children, since October last year. 1.2m people, representing 20% of the population, including 420,000 children, have been displaced in recent months. Save the Children is urging the government to bring its total commitment to $20m in humanitarian relief to Lebanon, \u201cin line with like-minded countries\u201d. Australia\u2019s response supports an increased international effort for the country, including the pledges made overnight in the International Conference in Support of Lebanon\u2019s People and Sovereignty, convened in Paris. However, we note with concern that the $1bn pledge goes towards not just humanitarian aid, but also military support. We strongly reiterate the need for an immediate ceasefire to ensure safe humanitarian access, to stop the conflict from escalating further, and prevent further suffering, particularly of children. The government is accelerating the development of a \u201cworld first\u201d national targeted skin cancer screening roadmap led by the Australians of the Year, professors Georgina Long and Richard Scolyer. Using the $10.3m investment announced today, the Melanoma Institute Australia will research risk-based and cost-effective national screening approaches, including improving skin cancer data collection for the Australian Cancer Database in close collaboration with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. In 2028 the Institute will deliver a report to the government with all the evidence about screening and guidance on how Australia might implement a national targeted skin cancer screening program. The health minister, Mark Butler, said the program would be a \u201cworld first,\u201d but its management would be more difficult than other national cancer screening programs: We want to make sure we\u2019ve got the research and the foundation right, because this is going to be a more tricky program to roll out than the population-wide programs we have, for example, in cervical cancer or in breast and bowel even though there are some age arrangements around that. This will be more targeted. We don\u2019t have a program around the world simply to take off the shelf and import. Prof Anne Cust from the Melanoma Institute said this would be the \u201cworld first high-quality, targeted screening program\u201d. In Germany they do have some population skin cancer screening, but it\u2019s not actually taken up particularly well at the population level, and it\u2019s not a targeted program. Long said the way researchers will identify who is high risk will be multi-factorial \u2013 age will be only one of many risk factors considered: Some of the common ones are red hair colour, people with lots of moles on their body, people with a family history, people that have had other types of skin cancer. These are the types of risk factors that we\u2019ll be looking at, also genetic risk factors too. Health minister not inclined to approve large increases to private health insurance premiums The health minister, Mark Butler, says he isn\u2019t inclined to approve large increases to private health insurance premiums, indicating the next increase will be \u201cwell below CPI\u201d inflation. Asked at a press conference this morning about whether the government would allow insurers to hike premiums on their customers by large amounts, the minister said it wouldn\u2019t be fair in a cost-of-living crisis. The government approved only a 3% rise this year, after insurers had asked for a much higher raise. Butler said: Earlier this year, I approved a private health insurance premium increase that was substantially below the going inflation rate. The insurers had asked for premium increases on average of 6% or more. I ended up approving, after a process of discussion with them and asking them to sharpen their pencil, an increase of slightly more than 3% well below CPI, and certainly well below the increases happening elsewhere in the insurance sector. And I intend to take that approach again over the coming months. Butler said he was conscious of needing to ensure \u201ca viable private health insurance industry and private hospital sector\u201d \u2013 before adding \u201cbut I\u2019m also very focused on patients and members on insurance funds to ensure that their cost-of-living is not overly impacted by any increase in insurance premiums over the coming months.\u201d But the minister did concede that the NSW government\u2019s changes to its health insurance levy could have an impact on people in that state: It is a matter that is still, as I understand it, going through the NSW parliament. But if that law passes, which probably we expect it will, that will have an impact on the state of NSW, and I think it\u2019s important to bear that in mind. Telstra and Optus will begin shutting down their 3G networks on Monday, and are warning customers if they have incompatible devices they may be cut off. Around 53,000 devices will potentially stop connecting to the networks once the switch-off starts, down from around 740,000 at the start of this year. Telstra announced yesterday that from 12.01am on Monday it will block all devices that can only call Triple Zero on 3G per a government mandate. Optus began blocking some of these devices last month. Telstra\u2019s shutdown will begin in Tasmania, with the rest of Australia completed by 4 November. The two companies have offered tens of thousands of free phones to customers in financial hardship in a bid to get the remaining customers off 3G. People can SMS 3 to 3498 to check if their device is affected. Rural health alliance CEO discussing 3G shutdown on Monday The CEO of the National Rural Health Alliance, Susi Tegen, just spoke with ABC TV about the 3G shutdown on Monday. Tegen said elderly people in regional areas rely on the 3G and their telephones \u201cfor safety and security\u201d with some devices not compatible with 4 or 5G: [This is] potentially leaving them with their device in a risky situation where they can\u2019t ring triple zero, or if they have alarms or cardio-monitors or oxygen systems which may be impacted \u2026 they may have no one else to support them if there is need. Tegen noted that Telstra had provided low-cost telephones, but isn\u2019t sure what the uptake has been. In the end, rural, remote and regional Australia deserves the same coverage the people in the city again. Just because they live out of the postcode region, why should they receive less services? We need to ensure there aren\u2019t as many blackspots and the 4G take-up is as high as it can be. Body of woman found on property at Gunnedah In New South Wales, police will address the media this afternoon after a woman\u2019s body was discovered in Gunnedah. As we reported earlier, police located the body at a property this morning after reports of a concern for welfare. She is yet to be formally identified, however is believed to be aged in her 50s, police said. A 29-year-old man was arrested at the scene and taken to Gunnedah police station where he is helping police with their inquiries. Police believe the man and woman were known to each other. Chief inspector Michael Wurth will appear outside Gunnedah police station at 1.30pm \u2013 we\u2019ll endeavour to bring you updates here. Anthony Albanese is asked about pressure on his own government at the conference, with suggestions from Pacific leaders that Australia is not doing enough on emissions. Yesterday, the Tuvalu prime minister released a report blaming Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom for producing 60% Commonwealth nations\u2019 carbon emissions, despite accounting for just 6% of the population. Albanese says he had \u201cpositive discussions\u201d with Pacific leaders. They recognise that the challenge of climate change doesn\u2019t mean you can flick a switch and act immediately. We need to make sure energy security is prioritised to make sure that we have that support going forward \u2026 the feedback from Pacific leaders has been very welcoming of Australia\u2019s leadership in the Pacific with climate action. Albanese backs strong comments from King Charles that climate change poses an \u201cexistential threat\u201d, suggesting he is correct about \u201cthe responsibility we have to future generations\u201d. In most parts of the world, with few exceptions, climate change is above politics. We are seeing the impact of climate change, recognised by scientists around the world. One of the first world leaders to recognise the challenge of climate change and the need to act was Margaret Thatcher. Albanese says Australia supports Pacific\u2019s global leadership on climate action Anthony Albanese says Chogm comes at an \u201cimportant time\u201d, noting it is the first time it\u2019s been held in the Pacific. The Pacific is a global leader in climate action. Australia supports that leadership. The meeting with the prime minister of Samoa and other Pacific partners was about galvanising action in our region. It will be front and centre of the next two days of deliberation. Albanese says Australia and the UK are \u201cold friends\u201d and \u201cpartners\u201d, noting this is the first time he has met Starmer face-to-face since he became the Labor leader. He announces new grants on the Australia-UK Renewable Hydrogen Innovation Partnership Program, the first formal bilateral announcement with the incoming government. We today discussed importantly our new climate and energy partnership we will deliver on. We have a common view about the challenge but the opportunity as well that climate change action represents. We are both on the path to net zero through the transition and we see that as an opportunity for new industry and jobs and a new industrialisation of our respective countries \u2026 There is a real opportunity for us to develop technologies together to make a difference as well as look at co-operation in climate finance. The new partnership will allow us to explore co-operation in all these areas. He says he and Starmer also discussed Aukus \u2013 with the foreign affairs ministers and defence ministers of both countries to meet in December. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is addressing the media at the sidelines of the opening of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa. He confirms he had a bilateral meeting with the Samoan prime minister, Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata\u02bbafa, this morning, followed by a meeting with the prime minister of the UK, Keir Starmer. Climate change has been on the agenda at Chogm, placing pressure on Australia, with King Charles using his visit to highlight the existential threat of the fossil industry and the inequality of the climate crisis\u2019s impacts. Burney shares throwback for World Teachers\u2019 Day Today marks World Teachers\u2019 Day and politicians across the divide have marked the occasion with sharing memories to social media \u2013 including Labor\u2019s Linda Burney. Burney has shared a photo from 1978, when she began her career as a teacher, and said: A lot has changed since then, but one thing has not: how hard our wonderful teachers work every day. Let\u2019s give a big thank you to all the teachers and educators who give our children the best start in life! Qantas has promised to give employees $1,000 as it seeks to repair relations with staff. The Qantas chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, said at the annual general meeting today that the payment would be made to non-executive employees \u201cto say thank you\u201d. The company has emerged from a bruising period for its reputation and is facing a hefty compensation bill expected to exceed $100m for its decision to illegally sack almost 1,700 baggage handlers in 2020. The airline recently published an independent report into its governance that found there had been alack of board focus on non-financial issues, employees and customers. Just under 1.4m have voted early for Queensland election The Electoral Commission of Queensland has provided an update on pre-polling across the state before tomorrow\u2019s election. The total number of early votes is just under 1.4m, after roughly 150,000 people cast their votes in pre-poll yesterday. Today is the last day of early voting. More than 3.68m Queenslanders are enrolled to vote in Saturday\u2019s election. More than 100 LGAs don\u2019t have access to long day care centres More than 100 local government\u2019s across Australia do not have access to long day care centres (LDC) and there is a shortage in lower-socioeconomic areas, according to a new report from Mandala and the Front Project. Most LGAs without LDC services are in rural communities, while the ACT has the greatest amount of supply relative to its population aged 0-6 years old \u2013 with 43 places in LDC services per 100 children. Conversely, Tasmania and Western Australia only have 23 places per 100 children. The more advantaged and metropolitan areas in Australia are also those that have the greatest access to LDC centres and the sector is increasingly being dominated by large for-profit providers who charge higher fees, the report found. The Front Project\u2019s chief executive, Caroline Croser-Barlow, said if the government focuses its childcare reforms solely on increased subsidies, it would only make the problem worse: If you simply pump money into the market via subsidies without conditions beyond regulatory compliance, what you will get is a market increasingly dominated by large for-profit providers. And the research tells us these large for-profits generally provide lower-quality education, worse workforce conditions and higher prices. All the focus of our debate is around subsidies but, no matter how they\u2019re calibrated, subsidies alone mean sleepwalking into a market we don\u2019t want. Severe heatwave warnings in place for parts of Queensland, NT and WA There are a number of fire and heatwave warnings in place across the country today. In the Northern Territory, there is an extreme fire danger warning in place for Barkly North, with Fire and Rescue advising: Extreme fire dangers are forecast [today] due to very hot and dry temperatures, combined with fresh east to southeasterly winds during the late morning and into the afternoon. This comes as a heatwave warning is in place for the Daly, Tiwi and Arnhem districts across the territory. The Bureau of Meteorology says temperatures could reach the low 40s inland, with severe heatwave conditions set to persist into next week. A severe heatwave warning is also in place for parts of far north Queensland, including over the Cape York Peninsula \u2013 building further over the weekend and into next week. In Western Australia, a severe heatwave warning is also in place for the Kimberley, Pilbara and North Interior districts. Conditions are expected to persist into the weekend, impacting Port Hedland. Search for missing senior\u2019s body as murder charge laid A semi-rural property is being searched for the body of a missing elderly man on the same day his accused killer appears in court for the first time, AAP reports. Police allege Edwin Dobbin, 82, was shot dead some time after he disappeared from southwest Sydney in late September. Nearly a month later, detectives charged a 67-year-old with killing the elderly man and disposing of his body. The accused killer, who police said knew Dobbin, was arrested at a home in Smithfield yesterday after allegedly telling authorities conflicting accounts of the elderly man\u2019s disappearance. Following the arrest, police began searching a semi-rural property in the Hawkesbury region, northwest of Sydney, where they believe Dobbin\u2019s body is buried. Authorities said they would continue the search for his remains today. The accused man was also charged with hindering an investigation into a serious indictable offence and the unlawful disposal of a corpse. He was refused police bail and is due to appear at Fairfield Local Court today. Two missing-person appeals were issued for Dobbin after he was last spotted at Leppington, about 80km from where the search for his body was taking place, early on the morning of 25 September. New Qantas chair pledges to resolve future issues \u2018quickly and ethically\u2019 The new chair of Qantas, John Mullen, struck a conciliatory tone in his opening remarks at the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Hobart today, as the airline seeks to avoid a repeat of last year\u2019s tense exchanges. Mullen told shareholders that: There is no pretending that last year was anything other than a very difficult year for Qantas. You have our absolute commitment to learn from the past, correct mistakes quickly and ethically if they occur, and ensure that we earn the trust and respect of all of our stakeholders, from government to customers to employees and to everyday Australians. The airline will be hoping to avoid a second strike to its remuneration report today, after shareholders delivered one of Australia\u2019s largest ever protest votes against executive pay at last year\u2019s meeting. Last year, the meeting erupted with shareholders shouting \u201cshame on you\u201d at the board\u2019s chairman, Richard Goyder, who has since stepped down. Shareholders are expected to ask questions today about the fallout of a string of scandals that included a $100m penalty for selling thousands of tickets for cancelled flights. A man has ben arrested after a woman\u2019s body was located on a property in north-central New South Wales. About 8.20am this morning, police located the body of a woman at a Gunnedah property after reports of a concern for welfare. She is yet to be formally identified, however is believed to be aged in her 50s, police said. A 29-year-old man was arrested at the scene and taken to Gunnedah police station where he is helping police with their inquiries. No charges have been laid. Police believe the man and woman were known to each other. A crime scene has been established which will be forensically examined by specialist police, and a report will be prepared for the coroner. Miles continues challenge to visit 36 seats in 36 hours The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, is continuing his challenge to visit 36 seats in 36 hours before tomorrow\u2019s state election. He began the challenge yesterday at Maroochydore, sharing a photo to X from each stop along the way \u2013 including Caloundra, Pumicestone, Bancroft, Sandgate, Bulimba and the final stop of the day, Clayfield. This morning, he is on stop number 20 at Murrumba \u2013 his home seat. Just earlier, King Charles addressed the summit of Commonwealth leaders in Samoa, dodging calls to directly address slavery and the legacy of colonialism in the Commonwealth. During his speech to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, which is being attended by Anthony Albanese, Charles said he understood that \u201cpainful aspects of our past continue to resonate\u201d but asked Commonwealth leaders to \u201creject the language of division\u201d. None of us can change the past but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right inequalities that endure. The king has faced calls to reckon with Britain\u2019s colonial past, with many African, Caribbean and Pacific nations wanting this summit to commit to a discussion on the topic of reparatory justice, and discussion of financial compensation for slavery. The king did not directly address colonialism or slavery but, in a seeming nod to the subject and the legacies of inequality left in their wake, said: It is vital \u2026 that we understand our history to guide us to make the right choices in the future. Where inequalities exist \u2026 we must find the right ways and the right language to address them. As we look around the world and consider its many deeply concerning challenges, let us choose, within our Commonwealth family, the language of community and respect and reject the language of division. Crisafulli makes final Queensland election pitch David Crisafulli also made an election pitch to voters, who will go to the polls tomorrow, and said: The choice of the next election is very clear, and that is a choice between a majority LNP government \u2026 or a minority Labor government propped up by the extreme Greens at one end of the state and the chaotic Katters\u2019 at the other end. Think about what that means for you and the parliament. Earlier, the Labor leader, Steven Miles, ruled out deals with minor parties to form government, and said he was \u201ccampaigning for a majority government\u201d. Crisafulli commits to implementing Daniel\u2019s law at Walk for Daniel The Queensland opposition leader, David Crisafulli, is speaking to reporters from Caloundra before tomorrow\u2019s state election. As Andrew Messenger reported earlier, Crisafulli has spent the morning at the 20th Walk for Daniel \u2013 held by the Daniel Morcombe Foundation, in honour of the young murder victim. The opposition leader told reporters that, if elected, the LNP would enact Daniel\u2019s law \u2013 to see the formation of a public child sex offender register: [The family has] been campaigning for that for more than a decade and it is time \u2026 I can assure [that] if government changes, we will not let you down. Daniel\u2019s law will be law and that will be a great honour for a special little boy and a great legacy to keep Queensland kids safe. The Australian government has announced a further $10m in humanitarian assistance to conflict-affected civilians in Lebanon. In a statement from the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and the international development minister, Pat Conroy, the ministers note about 800,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon by the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Emergency shelters have been overwhelmed and humanitarian workers killed. Australia\u2019s assistance would be delivered through UN partners to \u201caddress immediate and emerging needs, including access to food, shelter, healthcare and other critical services\u201d, the statement said. Since 7 October the government has committed $94.5m in humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and Lebanon and \u201cto respond to the refugee crisis in the region worsened by those conflicts.\u201d Australia has been clear in its call for ceasefires in both Lebanon and in Gaza. We continue to call for all parties to uphold international law and protect civilians and humanitarian workers. The ministers also reiterated calls for Australians not to travel to Lebanon. King Charles opens Commonwealth heads of government meeting King Charles has just begun the opening address at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa. He said: I have met remarkable people in every conceivable walk of life and learned a great deal from so many proud cultures and traditions. All of this has given me an unshakeable faith in the special nature of our Commonwealth and the extraordinary value it holds. This is a family of countries, of organisations and of people. All nations are equal in this unique and voluntary association. We\u2019ll bring you the highlights from his speech shortly, so stay tuned. Cricket Australia (CA) has scrapped the lifetime leadership ban on David Warner that was controversially handed down after the Newlands ball-tampering incident, AAP reports. The suspension had been the last remaining sanction in place from the \u201csandpapergate\u201d saga, of which Warner was considered the architect. An independent three-member review panel unanimously determined Warner met the criteria to have his ban overturned after the former Test opener lodged an appeal with CA. The decision paves the way for Warner to hold a formal leadership role with the BBL\u2019s Sydney Thunder this summer. A police officer will face court over his alleged role in the theft of $100,000 cash from an elderly man during a home invasion in the outback town of Lightning Ridge, AAP reports. The senior constable, 36, is one of two men charged over the break and enter on the 78-year-old\u2019s residence in NSW\u2019s north-west on 3 October. The pair allegedly forced entry to the home and tied up the occupant before threatening him and stealing the cash, police have said. The victim was taken to a local hospital after sustaining arm and leg injuries in the robbery before being released. The off-duty officer and his alleged co-offender, 51, were arrested after searches on two homes in the Lake Illawarra area, south of Sydney, yesterday. The location is about 750km south of where the alleged crimes took place. Local police investigated the incident, but it was referred to the NSW Police Professional Standards Command after the officer was identified as one of the alleged culprits. Both men were charged with aggravated breaking and entering, and committing a serious indictable offence. They were refused police bail to appear at Wollongong Local Court today. Police said the employment of the officer, who was based in the southern region, was under review and investigations were ongoing. Man under guard in hospital after shots fired at police A man is in hospital under police guard after officers fired shots at a property in regional Victoria when coming under fire while attempting to search for weapons, AAP reports. Detectives went to the Dumbalk North home in Gippsland to execute a firearms warrant about 1.30pm yesterday when a man believed to live there fired shots, Victoria Police say. Officers then returned fire, the force said. A 56-year-old man was found injured at the property several hours later when it was deemed safe for police to approach the property. News footage from the scene showed armed police walking around the property as other officers blocked off surrounding roads. The man was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries and remains under police guard. No police were injured, and no charges have been laid over the incident. Anyone with information has been urged to contact investigators. Photos from the Chogm opening ceremony Here are some photos filtering through from the opening of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa: Two people dead after truck smashes into house Two people have died after a truck crashed into a house in regional Victoria, AAP reports. The truck veered off the Princes Highway and crashed into a home at Tower Hill near Warrnambool after 7am this morning. Two people who were inside the house died at the scene, with police yet to formally identify their bodies. The male truck driver was taken to hospital where he is being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said. No charges have been laid over the incident. Detectives from the major collision unit are on their way to the scene of the crash, which is about three hours drive from Melbourne. Anyone with information about what happened or relevant footage is being urged to contact police. Clare and Ley weigh in on Chalmers calls for ceasefire amid global inflation fight As Karen Middleton reported earlier, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today reiterate calls for a ceasefire in the Middle East, warning that any escalation represents a threat to the international economy and will make the fight against inflation harder. The education minister, Jason Clare, was on Sunrise earlier and weighed in on the matter: I think almost every country in the world now, from the US to the UK to the Kiwis to us, to, you know, almost every country I can think of is calling for an end to the war. We want an end to innocent people being killed in the Middle East, whether it\u2019s in Gaza or now in Lebanon. Fundamentally that\u2019s what\u2019s most important. We all see that death and destruction on our TV screens. I think the point [Chalmers is] making is, it has an economic impact. Whenever there\u2019s a war it has an economic impact. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has done that. We\u2019re now seeing evidence of that here too in terms of oil prices. The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, was also on the program and argued this is \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d from Chalmers: He\u2019s suggesting that the inflation that we\u2019re seeing at home is because of factors overseas. The problem is that the UK, the US, Canada, New Zealand are all seeing inflation come down. Queensland Fire Department issues warning amid high fire danger rating The Queensland Fire Department says that much of the state will reach a high fire danger rating today \u2013 with some reaching extreme. It said that in these conditions \u201cjust one spark to start a fire which can spread quickly into a significant bushfire\u201d, and issued this warning: If you live in an area with heightened conditions and you are planning on slashing, mowing or using machinery around vegetation, please reconsider or plan to take extra precautions. If work does need to happen, make sure you have water on hand to immediately extinguish any small fires and have someone supervising to ensure any danger is spotted early. On smoke-affected roads, please slow down and take care to keep yourself and our crews safe while they work to contain fires alongside the roadway. Early this morning, communities around the Barkly Highway at Cloncurry \u2013 between Powerhouse Road, Flinders Highway and Round Oak Road were issued a \u201cprepare to leave\u201d warning. An \u201camorous couple\u201d accused of causing major flooding and the evacuation of two Victorian train stations has been arrested, AAP reports. A water pipe and fire sprinkler at Melbourne Central station were damaged on the night of 10 October, causing extensive flooding to several platforms and triggering the automatic evacuation of both that station and nearby Flagstaff. The pair have since been arrested and interviewed, Victoria police said. A Ringwood man, 30, was remanded in custody over unrelated matters. He is expected to be charged with offences including criminal damage, public nuisance, wilful damage and interfering with fire apparatus. A St Albans woman, 32, was released pending further inquiries. The flooding was initially believed to have stemmed from an act of vandalism but the transport infrastructure minister, Danny Pearson, had said investigations found another cause. He said on 16 October: I\u2019ve been advised that Metro [Trains] have reviewed the CCTV footage and it would appear that an amorous couple in a stairwell dislodged the sprinkler. Perhaps a stairwell may not be an appropriate place to find yourself in after dinner. Miles says Crisafulli can\u2019t promise no change to abortion laws while also allowing conscience vote Earlier, the Queensland LNP leader, David Crisafulli, told ABC News Breakfast that there would be \u201cno change to abortion laws\u201d and accused Labor of running a scare campaign (see earlier post). Steven Miles was asked to respond to this on the program, and said Crisafulli had \u201cnot been able to give a straight answer to that question at all during this campaign\u201d. I think media outlets have added up, that they\u2019ve asked him more than 160 times, and the fact is that\u2019s just a promise he can\u2019t deliver. The Katter party will move a private member\u2019s bill that would give the state the power to force a woman to stay pregnant if she didn\u2019t want to be. We know that nearly all his MPs and candidates would vote for that bill because he\u2019d give them a conscience vote. Queensland women have to ask themselves \u2013 are you absolutely sure that there would be no change to your right to choose? If you\u2019re not absolutely sure, then change is a risk you can\u2019t afford. Miles defends government spending before Queensland election The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, made the rounds on breakfast television this morning and also spoke with ABC News Breakfast (we brought you his comments on the Today Show here). Miles was asked if he had given thought to potential economic impacts of \u201csplashing all this cash around\u201d in the lead-up to the election \u2013 with election promises on a free school lunch program, re-establishing a publicly owned power retailer and building state-owned petrol stations. Miles said the state could afford this because \u201cour economy is strong and because we made tough decisions, like increasing those coal royalties\u201d. The LNP opposed that, but we believe that when coal companies are making super profits, Queenslanders deserve to get a fair share of that. We will return to surplus in 2026-27. We\u2019ve just come out of two record surplus years and so this is really saying to Queenslanders that, in this period of time where we know inflation and higher interest rates are really crunching on them, that we can afford to support them because we have that strong economy and really low unemployment. Queensland LNP leader spends final morning before election at Walk for Daniel The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, has spent the final morning before Queensland election day at the Walk for Daniel, on the Sunshine Coast. The event is held by the Daniel Morcombe Foundation, in honour of the young murder victim. It is in its 20th year. He was joined by the federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, the Queensland governor, Jeannette Young, and thousands of ordinary people wearing red shirts. Albanese and Starmer meet for first time since latter took office Anthony Albanese has met with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, on the sidelines of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa. It was the first meeting between the two PMs since the election of the Starmer government. A joint statement said the leaders discussed the Australia-UK relationship, considering whether the two nations could \u201cstep-up their work together to meet common challenges and to realise new opportunities.\u201d Conversation topics included climate change and energy, with the PMs agreeing to enhance bilateral cooperation on this via the Australia-UK Climate and Energy Partnership. Grant recipients were announced under the joint hydrogen innovation partnership program, which will support six projects focused on industrial decarbonisation. The leaders discussed gains under the free-trade agreement, also discussing defence and strategic cooperation to ensure \u201cthe Aukus partnership delivers for the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific and beyond.\u201d They reaffirmed commitment to negotiating a bilateral treaty to develop the SSN-Aukus submarine for both nations, along with an approach that \u201csets the highest non-proliferation standards\u201d and centres \u201cpeace, stability and prosperity\u201d. The NDIS minister Bill Shorten has condemned independent senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s protest against King Charles as attention seeking that would not materially help the circumstances of Indigenous Australians. Thorpe shouted in protest at the king during his parliamentary reception on Monday, demanding a treaty with Indigenous Australians and declaring him \u201cnot our king\u201d: Shorten told Nine\u2019s Today show this morning that Thorpe was \u201cjust seeking attention\u201d. This is a person who thinks that performative yelling is going to extend the life expectancy of First Nations people \u2013 it won\u2019t. This is someone who thinks that swearing at the king is going to see more Aboriginal kids finish school \u2013 it won\u2019t. This doesn\u2019t help the health or job outcomes of First Nations people. It\u2019s pressure group tactics. Shorten said Thorpe was squandering \u201cthe privilege of being in the Senate\u201d by resorting to \u201clook-at-me tactics\u201d. Speaking on the same program, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, raised concerns about whether Thorpe was properly sworn into the Senate, after Thorpe raised doubts by highlighting that she had mispronounced part of it and then backtracked and said she had simply misspoken. Constitutional expert and Sydney University professor emerita Anne Twomey has said Thorpe signed the required documentation to join the Senate and that was the key. A man has been charged with domestic violence-related murder in western Sydney following an alleged fatal stabbing of a 64-year-old man, AAP reports. The 34-year-old man, known to the deceased, was denied bail and is set to face Parramatta Local Court this morning. Emergency services were called to a home on Layton Street, Wentworthville at 6.30am yesterday. Police officers found a man who had allegedly been stabbed in the neck. Paramedics were present but the man died at the scene. A 60-year-old woman at the property was not injured in the incident. Police have established a crime scene. Carr criticises government handling of Gaza conflict Wrapping up the interview, Kim Carr also argued that Labor\u2019s handling of the conflict in Gaza hasn\u2019t been good enough \u2013 and the country is \u201cdeeply divided\u201d now. Now, I know the polls will tell you that most people don\u2019t care much about it, but those that do care about it are highly concentrated \u2013 and they\u2019re concentrated in the particular electorates. And I think there is a deep, deep concern in those electorates about the issues that have now been well over a year in terms of the current war in Gaza, which of course go back way beyond the circumstances of the current conflict. Kim Carr argued that the Labor party has learnt \u201call the wrong lessons\u201d from the Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard time. He said the party caucus isn\u2019t ensuring a \u201cproper questioning\u201d of government direction, or assessment of policy options \u2013 pointing specifically to the Aukus submarine deal with the US and UK: The decision we\u2019re taking, for instance, on submarines, is one that I think is to be regretted. It is a proposition which I think shows that we\u2019ve adopted a project that actually was promoted by the conservatives, and so the conservatives are ruling from beyond the grave, particularly [Scott] Morrison\u2019s attitude. So I think the submarine program is essentially unaffordable, undeliverable and undermines our national sovereignty. Carr says Labor can\u2019t rely on \u2018identity politics\u2019 base but should fulfil \u2018historic mission\u2019 to represent whole country Continuing his ABC RN interview, former Labor senator Kim Carr argued there has been attempts by conservative media to \u201cdelegitimise the Labor party.\u201d Asked how Labor can appeal to suburban workers \u2013 and if Peter Dutton is doing a better job at this \u2013 Carr said a return to \u201chumanist universalism\u201d is needed, explaining it as: Our commitment to social justice, to economic equity, economic prosperity, to human rights \u2013 and we need to do so in a manner which we don\u2019t neglect the fact that the country is more diverse, and it is open to a whole range of different views. We simply can\u2019t rely on \u2026 an identity politics base, in terms of relying increasingly on self-isolating grievance groups, race or ethnicity, on gender and sexual orientation. We need to be able to appeal more broadly across the community to ensure that the Labor party fulfils its historic mission to represent the whole country, but particularly people that are disadvantaged by life circumstances. Carr argues that Labor lacks policy ambition Kim Carr told ABC RN that Anthony Albanese has \u201cfaced difficult circumstances\u201d as prime minister but the current predicaments facing the government are \u201cquite predictable\u201d. He said that Labor had got into office on the basis of a \u201csmall target strategy\u201d and that \u201cmany people don\u2019t seem to be able to identify the ambition that\u2019s needed to actually transform the country\u201d. It was disturbing to read recent polls that showed that most people couldn\u2019t identify the key issues that the government was pursuing. A third of people said they couldn\u2019t even remember the tax cuts, and so I\u2019m worried that we have not shown the appropriate level of ambition in terms of seeking to advance a Labor agenda which attracts support rather than that repels it, and that actually ensures that we don\u2019t adopt a censorious tone towards those people who disagree with us. In terms of the next election, Carr believes \u201cthe Labor project is in trouble\u201d and \u201cwe do need to be able to move more effectively to avoid minority government\u201d. Carr says Labor made \u2018error of judgment\u2019 in pursuing voice referendum on the back of low primary vote On the Indigenous voice referendum, Kim Carr argued that Labor \u201cmade an error of judgment\u201d going ahead with the vote \u201cwhen we understood just what the historical pattern was when you lost bipartisanship\u201d. He said that Labor went into the referendum campaign \u201cout of spirit of hubris\u201d, forgetting that the primary vote for Labor in 2022 election was the lowest since 1934. We didn\u2019t have this grand alliance to call back on. We, in fact, had just got in with a lower vote in 2022 than we got in 2019 and I think we made assumptions about how we could turn that around, particularly given the reactionary position that it was being taken by the Liberals, by the National party, which \u2013 of course \u2013 was playing up these huge divisions that occurred In the country in terms of the polarisation of political attitudes. Carr said \u201cof course it was proper that we seek the basic justice for Indigenous people\u201d but \u201cwe want to make sure we don\u2019t set back the cause\u201d. People who need government most turning to the right in \u2018disturbing\u2019 trend: Carr Former Victorian socialist left leader and senator Kim Carr has been speaking with ABC RN about his book \u2013 reflecting on 50 years of membership with the Labor party. Asked if Labor is losing touch with its blue-collar base \u2013 as he argues in his book \u2013 Carr said it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d that Labor\u2019s vote seems to be \u201cgoing up in more affluent areas and going down in areas that are more socially disadvantaged\u201d. But this wasn\u2019t unique to the Labor party, he said, arguing that people who need the government the most are moving to the right, around the world: This decoupling, if you like, is common in countries in Europe and England [and] in the United States, that the traditional form of representation through social democracy has seen that people that are better educated, better off financially, more affluent and [with] better life circumstances are turning to the left, whereas people that actually need governments the most are turning to the right. And that\u2019s a disturbing development from my point of view. \u201cIf we won the 2007 election, which we did under Kevin\u2019s leadership, he would remain as prime minister for two terms and in the third term Julia would take over. That was the agreement that had been struck [in my flat].\u201d This is how Kim Carr lays out his account of what he claims was a secret deal between Labor\u2019s \u201cdream team\u201d, in his new memoir, A Long March. Carr details how their agreement fell apart \u2013 alleging Gillard used \u201ctricked-up\u201d polling paid for by the mining industry to justify breaking the pact. Paul Daley has the whole, gripping yarn below: Carr is speaking with ABC RN now \u2013 we\u2019ll bring you the latest in a moment. A long-awaited ban on landlords evicting tenants for no reason passed the NSW parliament last night, AAP reports, along with other changes hoped to rebalance the nation\u2019s most expensive rental market. More than 2.2 million tenants have been waiting for the overhaul after Labor and the Coalition went into the 2023 state election promising to ban no-grounds evictions. The NSW Tenants\u2019 Union chief executive, Leo Patterson Ross, said the threat of eviction made tenants hesitant to ask for repairs or negotiate rent hikes: This is the single most significant change we can make to residential tenancies law, as without protection from unfair eviction in place we can\u2019t rely on other parts of the law to function properly. The Homelessness NSW CEO, Dominique Rowe, said the changes should relieve some pressure on homelessness services, which more than 68,000 people turned to for help every year. One of the main causes of homelessness is eviction from private rentals, so anything we can do to reduce evictions will keep people in housing and take pressure off our homelessness services. However, more social housing needs to be built, with 58,000 on waitlists for up to five years. The housing minister, Rose Jackson, said the changes to tenancies were straightforward and reasonable. There are millions of renters in our state \u2026 for those millions of people they have a reasonable expectation the rental market will provide them with safe and secure housing. Opponents to the bill expressed concerns it made investment less attractive and would not help increase housing supply. Miles says he won\u2019t make deals with minor parties to form government The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, also spoke with the Today show before tomorrow\u2019s election. After Annastacia Palaszczuk resigned last December, Miles has had 10 months to prove he deserves a four-year term in his own right. He said that, in this time, he has \u201cshown Queenslanders that I am pretty different\u201d: We increased those coal royalties and use them to deliver cost of living relief to every single Queenslander, as well as a comprehensive plan for healthcare, for housing and for community safety. And I\u2019m saying to Queenslanders that if you want to see more of what I\u2019ve done these last 10 months, give me a mandate in my own right tomorrow. After comments from the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, that Labor was doing deals with the Katters in the regions, Miles ruled this out: No, there\u2019ll be no deals with the minor parties to form government \u2026 I\u2019ve given that commitment. I\u2019m campaigning for a majority government, that\u2019s my goal. Miles argued the Katter party \u201cput the LNP in quite a bind \u2013 but it was a bind of their own making\u201d regarding the private member\u2019s bill on abortion: [The LNP was] trying to hide their position and Robbie [Katter] really just forced them to come clean with Queenslanders. And we know that means that most of them \u2013 almost all of them \u2013 believe that women should be forced to stay pregnant when they get pregnant. And I think that\u2019s something that a lot of Queenslanders don\u2019t agree with. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has weighed into debate over the Middle East conflict, telling global financial counterparts in Washington DC that any escalation represents a threat to the international economy and will make the fight against inflation harder. In a speech to G20 economic and finance ministers and other senior leaders gathered for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Chalmers has directly linked the now-multi-front Middle East conflict to the fate of the economy, internationally and at home. The global economy is uncertain and the global outlook is unsettling. The treasurer warned that any escalation of the conflict risked entrenching inflation problems worldwide: A broader war could put upward pressure on oil prices, prolong the fight against inflation and threaten the soft landing that we all seek. In seeking ceasefire and de-escalation, we are focused on the human catastrophe but there are economic consequences too. We know that more bloodshed is one of the biggest threats to the global economy. None of us will escape the economic consequences of an escalating war in the Middle East. The speech is Chalmers\u2019 most direct public intervention on the economic impact of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza and the associated conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon. He pointed to a 10% spike in oil prices within weeks of the conflict expanding in October and said the uncertainty about the situation had increased demand for safe-haven assets and pushed the price of gold up by 48%. Chalmers warned that a soft landing was assumed \u201cbut not assured\u201d. Dutton and Shorten weigh in on Queensland state election The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and the NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, both spoke with the Today show earlier from Queensland, before the election. Shorten was asked if he\u2019s worried by polling that Queensland could soon be LNP territory after nearly a decade. He said it was up to voters, and that Labor leader Steven Miles had \u201csurprised people [by] running a very active campaign.\u201d He\u2019s focused on the issues which affect Queenslanders: housing, health, cheaper transport and of course tackling youth crime. So we\u2019ll find out soon enough who\u2019s going to win. Shorten said he was \u201csurprised\u201d to see abortion raised through the campaign, and that it \u201cseems like someone in the LNP swallowed the Trump playbook, and we don\u2019t need that sort of division in this country\u201d. Dutton said it was \u201calways going to be a tough race\u201d and argued, as David Crisafulli did just earlier, that the Labor party\u2019s able to \u201csandbag seats\u201d. The fact is that it\u2019s time for a change in Queensland and law and order is out of control. Crisafulli questioned on prospect of Katter private member\u2019s bill on abortion David Crisafulli was also asked about the ongoing abortion debate in the state, after revealing this week he was pro-choice. So why did he vote against a move to legalise abortion in 2018? Crisafulli responded that Robbie Katter had removed his private member\u2019s bill on the matter and changed his position. However, as Ben Smee notes, some reports have claimed Katter had backtracked on introducing a bill which could lead to a conscience vote to wind back abortion access and rights \u2013 but a spokesperson for Katter said he made no such backtrack. Crisafulli was pushed on this, with host Michael Rowland saying Katter has not specifically ruled it out. But Crisafulli responded: Well, yes, he did. He did three days ago and, despite that, the government\u2019s scare campaign continues. He said \u201cthere will be no change to abortion laws and we have said that consistently and my team backed that position\u201d. The scare campaign on a sensitive issue that has been run, quite frankly, crosses the line, and we\u2019re better than that as Queenslanders \u2026 There won\u2019t be changes to abortion laws and Queenslanders need to know that. For Ben Smee\u2019s full analysis on this matter, you can read below: Queensland opposition leader responds to latest polling numbers The Queensland LNP leader, David Crisafulli, has been speaking with ABC News Breakfast before tomorrow\u2019s state election. As Ben Smee reports, although the LNP has been leading in all the polls leading up to the vote, the latest numbers show the race tightening slightly: Crisafulli said the election was \u201cgoing to be really, really close\u201d and commented on the likelihood of a minority Labor government beginning to emerge: We\u2019re hearing about deals being done with Katter in the regions and the Greens in the south-east. Asked about the latest polling numbers, the opposition leader said this shows \u201chow difficult change in government to my side of politics is in Queensland\u201d. What we\u2019re trying to do is only happened a handful of times. We\u2019ve got to try to win over a dozen seats, and we start a long way behind the eight-ball. We got a voting system that supports the Labor party being propped up predominantly by the Greens and swapping votes with the Katters\u2019 in the regions. We\u2019re up against it. AAP has more details on the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, which occurs every two years and is being hosted in the Pacific for the first time \u2013 in Samoa. Pacific island nations are pushing for more to be done to address rising sea levels, with the effects of climate change posing an existential threat to smaller island nations in the region. The heads of 56 Commonwealth nations are taking part in the summit \u2013 including the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. It is the first Chogm King Charles and Queen Camilla are presiding over since taking the throne. An opening ceremony will precede the official group photo today, and the king will then hold a reception for newly appointed heads of state before a broader reception for leaders and their partners later in the evening. A more secretive leaders retreat will take place at a beach resort tomorrow. The king will give his keynote speech around 9am AEDT. Albanese will also hold his first face-to-face meeting with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, since the latter took office. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties \u2013 thanks to Martin for getting us started this morning. I\u2019ll be with you through most of our rolling coverage today \u2013 as the Commonwealth heads of government meeting begins in Samoa, and Queensland gears up to head to the polls tomorrow. As always, you can read out with any tips, feedback or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s go. The federal minister for employment and workplace relations, Murray Watt, has responded to a Guardian Australia investigation into how employees in Woolworths-owned warehouses are being tracked and timed. He says that while there may be benefits, new workplace technology needs to be managed in a way that \u201cprotects and respects\u201d workers\u2019 rights: In some cases, there\u2019s clearly a disconnect between employers\u2019 expectations of what new technology can deliver and what is safe and sustainable for workers. At the end of the day, workers are entitled to safe workplaces and fair working conditions. Workers told Guardian Australia they are under pressure to meet time standards they say are unfair and putting safety at risk. In response to the Guardian investigation, a spokesperson for Primary Connect \u2013 Woolworths\u2019 supply chain arm \u2013 said the company was committed to ensuring its workplaces were safe and productive. Watt said the government\u2019s inquiry into the digital transformation of workplaces will look at the impact of AI: We need to ensure that automation-led management considers the circumstances of individual workers and doesn\u2019t expose them to unsafe and unfair working conditions. We need to make sure appropriate mechanisms are in place to bring unions and employers together to work collaboratively as we all grapple with the emergence of new technologies and their impacts in the workplace. Our Queensland correspondent Ben Smee has been on the campaign trail with Steven Miles as he attempts to secure a fourth successive win for Labor in the Sunshine State. He finds that although the premier started off a long way behind in the polls, he has learned to be himself on the stump and has weaponised abortion to attack his LNP opponent, David Crisafulli. That Newspoll I mentioned at the top has the LNP ahead by four points overall \u2013 but if that narrows any more Crisafulli could find himself in a minority and dependent on independents such as the Katters\u2019 to form a government. Here\u2019s Ben\u2019s piece for all the details: The NSW government has launched an LGBTQ+ advisory council, with its first task being to establish the state\u2019s first inclusion strategy. The council \u2013 made up of 16 members who will serve a two-year term \u2013 includes Ian Roberts, the first openly gay rugby league player, Nicholas Stewart from \u201cAustralia\u2019s only out loud and proud LGBTQIA+ law firm\u201d Dowson Turco Lawyers, and the Equality Australia chief executive, Anna Brown. 78er Robyn Kennedy, who will serve as co-chair, says the council\u2019s work will \u201cfocus on ensuring that all LGBTIQ+ individuals in NSW are supported, respected and have their rights upheld\u201d. This is what our community has always stood for through our decades of advocacy and resilience. Members of the council \u201cwill work closely with the NSW government to provide insights and recommendations on issues affecting LGBTIQ+ communities\u201d, as put in a government media release. The council\u2019s first task will be to work with the government to develop NSW\u2019s first LGBTIQ+ inclusion strategy. Qantas has sought to reassure the travelling public that hundreds of its engineers putting down their tools today will not lead to delays or cancellations across the country, as the airline\u2019s shareholders and executives meet in Hobart for the company\u2019s annual general meeting. Engineers from three unions voted in favour of taking industrial action, which will include two sets of four-hour stop works planned for today across Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and Hobart. Qantas has disputed the unions claim that the industrial action will cause disruptions for passengers during peak windows. A Qantas spokesperson said \u201cour teams have worked hard to put contingencies in place and we expect there to be no impact to our customers\u201d: We had a number of meetings with the unions prior to the industrial action. We want to continue to engage with them to find a way forward but they have chosen to take action. Our preference is to reach an agreement that includes pay rises and other benefits. The industrial action coincides with Qantas\u2019 AGM today, with union representatives also set to rally outside the hotel in Hobart where the airline\u2019s shareholders and executives are gathering. Today\u2019s stoppages are the latest in a series by engineers since September, as unions have been in negotiations with Qantas seeking better pay and improved conditions. Qantas\u2019s engineering workforces comprise 2,600 employees, with only members of the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union (AMWU), the Australian Workers\u2019 Union (AWU) and the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) able to take part in the industrial action. While the three unions \u2013 which make up the Qantas Engineers\u2019 Alliance \u2013 claim 600 engineers will take part in the action, Qantas believes just 400 are able to. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it\u2019ll be Emily Wind with the main action. Written off as the state election campaign began, the Queensland premier, Steven Miles, has gone from underdog to attack dog with a combative stump performance which has put LNP frontrunner David Crisafulli on the back foot. But has he left it too late? A Newspoll published today suggests he has with the LNP ahead of Labor by 52.5% to 47.5% after preferences, converting to a two-seat majority. More coming up. Qantas has sought to reassure travellers that strikes today will not lead to delays as the company\u2019s AGM takes place in Hobart. And King Charles, who yesterday took part in a traditional kava-drinking ceremony and was declared a \u201chigh chief\u201d of Samoa, will turn to perhaps less colourful duties this morning when he gives the keynote speech at the official opening of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in the Pacific nation.",

      "body": "<p>A good idea for a TV show is a precious thing and, on paper, Nautilus is a great idea. It\u2019s a prequel to Jules Verne\u2019s 1870 novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, providing a fuller backstory for Captain Nemo, the mercurial captain of the futuristic submarine Nautilus, and following the majestic craft on its first adventures.</p> <p>As per Verne\u2019s follow-up novel The Mysterious Island, Nemo here is Indian and played by Shazad Latif \u2013 who has a knack for filling small roles with lasting cult appeal (including IT genius Tariq Masood in Spooks and Clem Fandango (\u201cYes I can hear you, Clem Fandango!\u201d) in Toast of London. Now he\u2019s a dominant leading man, a naval engineering wizard who, in 1857, is working as an indentured labourer for the rapacious East India Company in Bombay. To prevent the ship he has been forced to build being used for fresh colonial evil, and to win his freedom, he steals the Nautilus and sets off on an indefinite maritime escapade, helped by a crew of fellow revolutionaries, random hangers-on and a handful of hostages.</p> <p>Most notable among the captives is the sensationally monikered Humility Lucas (Georgia Flood), a posh Englishwoman whose personal connection to the East India Company ensures that the Nautilus will be pursued by moustache-twirling Britons until Nemo is brought to justice. As well as being a headstrong type who keeps trying to escape and does not pay the submarine\u2019s skipper any respect \u2013 although perhaps she and Nemo will warm to each other eventually \u2013 she\u2019s also a clever stick, the daughter of an engineer who wants to emulate her beloved father. She hasn\u2019t been on board the Nautilus for five minutes before she\u2019s shouting: \u201cI need grease and a pipe clamp!\u201d and fixing a leak using a cloth strip torn from her petticoats.</p> <p>We\u2019re all set for a Twenty Thousand Leagues reboot \u2013 the Nautilus has encounters with giant squid and treacherous frozen waters that echo the book \u2013 boosted by a female foil and a clear antagonist in the form of \u201cthe Company\u201d, which gives the drama an explicit political bent. Out-of-control capitalism is blighting the planet and condemning millions to miserable servitude \u2013 as they bob uncertainly on, the characters debate the extent to which the drastic action favoured by Nemo is the optimal solution, but it\u2019s suggested that resistance is long overdue. And, if the salty class war starts to drag, there\u2019s always a whale to wonder at.</p>    <p>It should be ace, but the long and arduous journey Nautilus has taken to reach the screen suggests it might not be. The show has now been picked up by Prime Video, more than a year after it was made for Disney+, who declined to distribute it. Although a scaling back of budgets was cited, if Disney had wanted Nautilus, they surely could have found the remaining cash. We have to presume they saw it and balked.</p> <p>Sadly, you can see why. Latif and Flood are fine, albeit in roles where the script keeps leaving them one or two killer moments short in every episode. Beyond them, the trouble starts. The submarine\u2019s crew and passengers again sound good in theory: there\u2019s a bloviating coward, a morose wisecracker, a wily trickster who emerges victorious in every scenario, a linguistically enigmatic strongman and a dog. But the outstanding supporting performance is given by the dog.</p> <p>A show like this can forgive one or two actors who are wooden, but that virus runs through nearly everyone here. Because it already feels like Our Flag Means Death with fewer jokes, it loses whatever comic relief it\u2019s meant to have, because every light moment drops with a heavy clang. In their defence, the cast are regularly landed with difficult tasks: Nautilus loves the old cliche of cutting to members of the ensemble after an improbable escape from peril, and asking them to laugh with relief while gazing into the middle distance. There is no middle distance on a submarine, but in a show like this, that doesn\u2019t stop anyone.</p> <p>Meanwhile, with Nautilus not seeming confident about how old its target audience is, the action scenes all come out half baked. Underwater creatures are convincing enough, without provoking much awe; gun battles and knife fights have high casualty counts, without any proper air of threat. The theme of sticking it to the corporate oppressor also has the handbrake applied to it, mainly in the form of Nemo\u2019s annoying deputy, Benoit (Thierry Fr\u00e9mont), who moans whenever Nemo contemplates violent vengeance against a Company Man, even after one of them has stabbed Benoit in the guts. Nautilus could have been a monster; in the end, it barely causes a ripple.</p> <p>\u2022 Nautilus is on Prime Video now.</p>",

As per Verne\u2019s follow-up novel The Mysterious Island, Nemo here is Indian and played by Shazad Latif \u2013 who has a knack for filling small roles with lasting cult appeal (including IT genius Tariq Masood in Spooks and Clem Fandango (\u201cYes I can hear you, Clem Fandango!\u201d) in Toast of London. Now he\u2019s a dominant leading man, a naval engineering wizard who, in 1857, is working as an indentured labourer for the rapacious East India Company in Bombay. To prevent the ship he has been forced to build being used for fresh colonial evil, and to win his freedom, he steals the Nautilus and sets off on an indefinite maritime escapade, helped by a crew of fellow revolutionaries, random hangers-on and a handful of hostages. Most notable among the captives is the sensationally monikered Humility Lucas (Georgia Flood), a posh Englishwoman whose personal connection to the East India Company ensures that the Nautilus will be pursued by moustache-twirling Britons until Nemo is brought to justice. As well as being a headstrong type who keeps trying to escape and does not pay the submarine\u2019s skipper any respect \u2013 although perhaps she and Nemo will warm to each other eventually \u2013 she\u2019s also a clever stick, the daughter of an engineer who wants to emulate her beloved father. She hasn\u2019t been on board the Nautilus for five minutes before she\u2019s shouting: \u201cI need grease and a pipe clamp!\u201d and fixing a leak using a cloth strip torn from her petticoats. We\u2019re all set for a Twenty Thousand Leagues reboot \u2013 the Nautilus has encounters with giant squid and treacherous frozen waters that echo the book \u2013 boosted by a female foil and a clear antagonist in the form of \u201cthe Company\u201d, which gives the drama an explicit political bent. Out-of-control capitalism is blighting the planet and condemning millions to miserable servitude \u2013 as they bob uncertainly on, the characters debate the extent to which the drastic action favoured by Nemo is the optimal solution, but it\u2019s suggested that resistance is long overdue. And, if the salty class war starts to drag, there\u2019s always a whale to wonder at. It should be ace, but the long and arduous journey Nautilus has taken to reach the screen suggests it might not be. The show has now been picked up by Prime Video, more than a year after it was made for Disney+, who declined to distribute it. Although a scaling back of budgets was cited, if Disney had wanted Nautilus, they surely could have found the remaining cash. We have to presume they saw it and balked. Sadly, you can see why. Latif and Flood are fine, albeit in roles where the script keeps leaving them one or two killer moments short in every episode. Beyond them, the trouble starts. The submarine\u2019s crew and passengers again sound good in theory: there\u2019s a bloviating coward, a morose wisecracker, a wily trickster who emerges victorious in every scenario, a linguistically enigmatic strongman and a dog. But the outstanding supporting performance is given by the dog. A show like this can forgive one or two actors who are wooden, but that virus runs through nearly everyone here. Because it already feels like Our Flag Means Death with fewer jokes, it loses whatever comic relief it\u2019s meant to have, because every light moment drops with a heavy clang. In their defence, the cast are regularly landed with difficult tasks: Nautilus loves the old cliche of cutting to members of the ensemble after an improbable escape from peril, and asking them to laugh with relief while gazing into the middle distance. There is no middle distance on a submarine, but in a show like this, that doesn\u2019t stop anyone. Meanwhile, with Nautilus not seeming confident about how old its target audience is, the action scenes all come out half baked. Underwater creatures are convincing enough, without provoking much awe; gun battles and knife fights have high casualty counts, without any proper air of threat. The theme of sticking it to the corporate oppressor also has the handbrake applied to it, mainly in the form of Nemo\u2019s annoying deputy, Benoit (Thierry Fr\u00e9mont), who moans whenever Nemo contemplates violent vengeance against a Company Man, even after one of them has stabbed Benoit in the guts. Nautilus could have been a monster; in the end, it barely causes a ripple. \u2022 Nautilus is on Prime Video now.",

The settlement can be found within the archaeological area and could date back as far as the ninth century BC. The Romans conquered it in 283BC. I stood on the sunny hilltop, imagining that I was a Roman, spying my enemies approaching. There is far more to see in Fiesole than first appears \u2013 including a Roman theatre, Roman and Etruscan artefacts and the remains of Roman baths. This fascinating town is definitely worth a visit, to feel immersed in ancient history.<br><strong>Alison N</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Wrestling school and mosaics, Cyprus</strong></h2> \n<p>Cyprus is better known by some for its nightclubs than its Greco-Roman ancient history, but at <a href=\"https://www.visitcyprus.com/discover-cyprus/rural/sites-monuments/kourion-archaeological-site-2/\">Kourion</a>, established on the south-west coast of the island in the 12th century BC, you can find the ruins of a thriving former city. With lots of the ruins still intact, you get a real sense of how sophisticated these centuries-old civilisations were, with a central market, ancient Greek wrestling school and many bathhouses adorned in intricate mosaic tiles and underfloor heating dating back to AD1. The theatre is the jewel in the crown, with an expansive view of the Mediterranean serving as a backdrop.

This large cairn stands on a headland overlooking both the Bay of Quiberon and the entrance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/may/26/france-brittany-gulf-of-morbihan-walking-holiday-islands-vannes\">Gulf of Morbihan</a>. It contains two stone chambers with numerous Neolithic and Gallo-Roman carvings. However, it must be the only Neolithic site to have also been used as a gun emplacement and bunker during the second world war. The juxtaposition of concrete on to the ancient stones is a bizarre sight. The bunker has been converted into a small museum and the former gun turret offers a panoramic view of this outstanding area. The cairn is within walking distance of the vibrant <a href=\"https://www.francethisway.com/places/port-de-crouesty.php\">Port du Crouesty</a>. Entry is \u20ac7. <br><strong>Clare</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Ruins in the Rhodope, Bulgaria</strong></h2> \n<p>A place for gods and humans to commune through the awe of nature, Bulgaria\u2019s <a href=\"https://bulgariatravel.org/medieval-archaeological-complex-perperikon-town-of-kardzhali/\">Perperikon</a> was a sacred place even before written history, founded by Thracians in the fifth millennium BC. It is one of the biggest fortresses in Europe, and archaeological studies are continuing, but it was almost certainly a site of worship of Dionysus to rival Delphi, and later hosted Romans, Goths and Bulgarians. I found the ancient plumbing and sacrificial rites fascinating and the views of the surrounding forests on the gentle peaks of the Rhodope mountains, stunning.<br><strong>Gergana</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Roman theatre to ourselves, North Macedonia</strong></h2> \n<p>On a visit to North Macedonia my wife and I visited <a href=\"https://bitola.info/heraclea-lyncestis-bitola/\">Heraclea Lyncestis</a>, just outside the town of Bitola, a site which saw Greek, Roman and Byzantine rule. We were practically the only visitors, which surprised us given how fascinating the site was. Lyncestis boasts truly impressive remains, which include a theatre, Roman baths and a basilica with intricate mosaic floors that display vibrant scenes from early Christian iconography. The theatre, built during Roman rule, is still in remarkable condition. After exploring the ancient ruins, you can relax and enjoy the charm of beautiful Bitola.<br><strong>Michael</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Where Paul baptised Lydia, Greece</strong></h2> \n<p>Two hours from Thessaloniki by public coach, then a local hop up from Kavala, brings you to the remains of <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1517/\">Philippi</a>, a town established in 360BC and named by Philip II of Macedon. This once great city on the Via Egnatia Roman road across the Balkans, where Augustus settled his veterans, is now a Unesco world heritage site. Its rural location and vast size means it feels surprisingly uncrowded, and it has a good cafe and toilets. Don\u2019t forget to stray north to a stream beyond the walls (described in the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament) where Paul baptised Lydia, perhaps the first European Christian. Soak up the centuries of history in peace, but don\u2019t forget your sun hat.<br><strong>John Sexton</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Into the Spanish stone age</strong></h2> \n<p>In quiet <a href=\"https://antequera.co.uk/\">Antequera</a>, a small city in the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/andalucia\">Andaluc\u00eda</a>, you can find a collection of breathtaking megalithic ruins. In particular the Dolmen of Menga is one of the earliest and largest known burial monuments in western Europe, dating from about 3600BC \u2013 I spent a good amount of time just amazed at the effort and time that went into building its cavernous interior. Best of all I had the whole place to myself!<br><strong>Alex</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>The Portuguese Stonehenge</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.visitevora.net/en/almendres-cromlech-portugal/\">Cromlech of the Almendres</a> is a would-be Portuguese Stonehenge stretching out across a pronounced, sunrise-facing slope near \u00c9vora in the Alentejo region, 80 miles east of Lisbon. The giant egg-shaped megaliths, dating back to the sixth millennium BC, make up an asymmetrical figure of eight, and much like the famous Wiltshire monument, this enormous stone circle\u2019s evolution extended over 1,000 years back in the Neolithic period. Prehistoric carvings adorn many of the megaliths, adding further evidence of this being the south-western end of an expansive maritime network of trade and belief along the western European fringe.<br><strong>Matt</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Roman routines brought to life, Provence, France</strong></h2> \n<p>A triumphal arch and magnificent mausoleum mark the entrance to the Roman remains of <a href=\"https://www.site-glanum.fr/en\">Glanum</a>, situated on the outskirts of Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence just south of Avignon. In a secluded valley at the foot of the Alpilles, Glanum - a Glanic, then Greek and Roman (from about 49BC) settlement dating from around the fourth century BC - is a wonderfully atmospheric site. If you are fortunate enough to visit on a quiet day, it is perfectly possible to imagine Roman life in the villas, with their baths nearby, while the basilica, forum, and temples, including a religious sanctuary around a sacred spring, remind you of the significance of Glanum in Roman times. <br><strong>Dianne</strong></p> \n<h2>Winning tip: Jersey\u2019s Celtic coin hoard and a Neolithic gem</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.jerseyheritage.org/visit/places-to-visit/la-hougue-bie/\">La Hougue Bie</a> in Jersey is an incredible Neolithic ritual site.

      "bodyText": "Immersed in antiquity, near Florence, Italy Feeling the need for some brief respite from the crowds and snaking queues in Florence, an afternoon visit to the Etruscan hilltop town of Fiesole fit the bill. The settlement can be found within the archaeological area and could date back as far as the ninth century BC. The Romans conquered it in 283BC. I stood on the sunny hilltop, imagining that I was a Roman, spying my enemies approaching. There is far more to see in Fiesole than first appears \u2013 including a Roman theatre, Roman and Etruscan artefacts and the remains of Roman baths. This fascinating town is definitely worth a visit, to feel immersed in ancient history. Alison N Wrestling school and mosaics, Cyprus Cyprus is better known by some for its nightclubs than its Greco-Roman ancient history, but at Kourion, established on the south-west coast of the island in the 12th century BC, you can find the ruins of a thriving former city. With lots of the ruins still intact, you get a real sense of how sophisticated these centuries-old civilisations were, with a central market, ancient Greek wrestling school and many bathhouses adorned in intricate mosaic tiles and underfloor heating dating back to AD1. The theatre is the jewel in the crown, with an expansive view of the Mediterranean serving as a backdrop. It really is a special place. Yanni Pitsillides Neolithic to Nazi era, Brittany, France This summer we paid a visit to the 6,000-year-old Cairn de Petit Mont in Brittany. This large cairn stands on a headland overlooking both the Bay of Quiberon and the entrance to the Gulf of Morbihan. It contains two stone chambers with numerous Neolithic and Gallo-Roman carvings. However, it must be the only Neolithic site to have also been used as a gun emplacement and bunker during the second world war. The juxtaposition of concrete on to the ancient stones is a bizarre sight. The bunker has been converted into a small museum and the former gun turret offers a panoramic view of this outstanding area. The cairn is within walking distance of the vibrant Port du Crouesty. Entry is \u20ac7. Clare Ruins in the Rhodope, Bulgaria A place for gods and humans to commune through the awe of nature, Bulgaria\u2019s Perperikon was a sacred place even before written history, founded by Thracians in the fifth millennium BC. It is one of the biggest fortresses in Europe, and archaeological studies are continuing, but it was almost certainly a site of worship of Dionysus to rival Delphi, and later hosted Romans, Goths and Bulgarians. I found the ancient plumbing and sacrificial rites fascinating and the views of the surrounding forests on the gentle peaks of the Rhodope mountains, stunning. Gergana Roman theatre to ourselves, North Macedonia On a visit to North Macedonia my wife and I visited Heraclea Lyncestis, just outside the town of Bitola, a site which saw Greek, Roman and Byzantine rule. We were practically the only visitors, which surprised us given how fascinating the site was. Lyncestis boasts truly impressive remains, which include a theatre, Roman baths and a basilica with intricate mosaic floors that display vibrant scenes from early Christian iconography. The theatre, built during Roman rule, is still in remarkable condition. After exploring the ancient ruins, you can relax and enjoy the charm of beautiful Bitola. Michael Where Paul baptised Lydia, Greece Two hours from Thessaloniki by public coach, then a local hop up from Kavala, brings you to the remains of Philippi, a town established in 360BC and named by Philip II of Macedon. This once great city on the Via Egnatia Roman road across the Balkans, where Augustus settled his veterans, is now a Unesco world heritage site. Its rural location and vast size means it feels surprisingly uncrowded, and it has a good cafe and toilets. Don\u2019t forget to stray north to a stream beyond the walls (described in the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament) where Paul baptised Lydia, perhaps the first European Christian. Soak up the centuries of history in peace, but don\u2019t forget your sun hat. John Sexton Into the Spanish stone age In quiet Antequera, a small city in the heart of Andaluc\u00eda, you can find a collection of breathtaking megalithic ruins. In particular the Dolmen of Menga is one of the earliest and largest known burial monuments in western Europe, dating from about 3600BC \u2013 I spent a good amount of time just amazed at the effort and time that went into building its cavernous interior. Best of all I had the whole place to myself! Alex The Portuguese Stonehenge Cromlech of the Almendres is a would-be Portuguese Stonehenge stretching out across a pronounced, sunrise-facing slope near \u00c9vora in the Alentejo region, 80 miles east of Lisbon. The giant egg-shaped megaliths, dating back to the sixth millennium BC, make up an asymmetrical figure of eight, and much like the famous Wiltshire monument, this enormous stone circle\u2019s evolution extended over 1,000 years back in the Neolithic period. Prehistoric carvings adorn many of the megaliths, adding further evidence of this being the south-western end of an expansive maritime network of trade and belief along the western European fringe. Matt Roman routines brought to life, Provence, France A triumphal arch and magnificent mausoleum mark the entrance to the Roman remains of Glanum, situated on the outskirts of Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence just south of Avignon. In a secluded valley at the foot of the Alpilles, Glanum - a Glanic, then Greek and Roman (from about 49BC) settlement dating from around the fourth century BC - is a wonderfully atmospheric site. If you are fortunate enough to visit on a quiet day, it is perfectly possible to imagine Roman life in the villas, with their baths nearby, while the basilica, forum, and temples, including a religious sanctuary around a sacred spring, remind you of the significance of Glanum in Roman times. Dianne Winning tip: Jersey\u2019s Celtic coin hoard and a Neolithic gem La Hougue Bie in Jersey is an incredible Neolithic ritual site. A burial chamber in use between about 4000BC and 3500BC sits at the end of a dark underground passage, opening up to a deep chamber which aligns with the equinox sunrise. Above the chamber there is a tall prehistoric mound. Take the winding path up to a 16th-century chapel, with beautiful views. On site there\u2019s also a brilliant exhibition about Le C\u00e2tillon II, a Celtic and Roman coin hoard discovered in east Jersey in 2012 and thought to have belonged to a tribe fleeing Julius Caesar\u2019s armies. Take some local cheese, bread and Jersey cider, and enjoy a picnic in the beautiful grounds. Laura Douse",

But the Commonwealth summit is not just a place for world leaders to talk shop once every two years \u2013 it can provide an important space to shift frameworks and shape policy.

The prime minister of the Bahamas, Philip Davis, has said: \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t know that money, in and of itself, could adequately compensate for the wrongs of the past. The ghost that haunts us today cannot be, in my view, dispelled by a monetary gift.\u201d</p> <p>A draft version of the final communique <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6vy79p750o\">reported by the BBC this week</a> stated that leaders \u201cagreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The response from the summit</strong></p>    <p>There has been consternation among Caribbean leaders who were expecting a more open-minded approach from Britain\u2019s recently elected Labour government. The fact the that foreign secretary, David Lammy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/slavery-reparations-not-on-agenda-at-commonwealth-summit-says-no-10\">has in the past spoken</a> in favour of reparations gave those nations hope there would be a shift in tone from the new administration. In 2018, Lammy wrote on Twitter that Caribbean people who were enslaved, colonised and invited to Britain as citizens do not just want an apology, but \u201cwe want reparations and compensation\u201d. But there is no trace of this position among government ministers. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, doubled down yesterday, saying an <a href=\"https://x.com/faisalislam/status/1849471033243250854\">interview</a>: \u201cLook, I mean, we\u2019re not going to be paying out the reparations that some countries are speaking about.\u201d</p> <p>There was an expectation that the UK \u201cwould be more willing to move forward with the issue of reparations\u201d, Natricia says. Starmer asserted that he does not want to get stuck in a \u201cvery long endless discussion about reparations on the past\u201d and instead wishes to look forward and deal with current issues affecting the countries attending the summit, like the climate crisis, which is hitting countries in the global south, particularly smaller and island states, the hardest. But there is no way to separate these issues in the eyes of many of these states. The argument for reparations and reparatory justice is about tending to the enduring scars of transatlantic slavery on the social, economic and psychological outcomes of the region. \u201cCaribbean states are saying that this is not an issue that\u2019s in the past, it is something that is still having an impact on us,\u201d Natricia adds.</p> <p>Leaders will be heading to a retreat as part of the summit, where they will talk behind closed doors about the knottiest and most challenging issues of the summit, including reparations, away from the glare of the media.</p> <p>There is no way to know what will be said or the conclusions that will come out of these discussions, but it is clear that the initial offhand dismissal from the UK has not slowed down the movement. The Bahamas\u2019 foreign minister, Frederick Mitchell, told the BBC that it was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before Starmer \u201cchanges\u201d his position on reparations. \u201cCaribbean governments are very clear,\u201d says Natricia. \u201cThey are going to be stepping up this campaign. They feel that they have a legal and moral justification to do so.\u201d</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>As <strong>pubs and music venues</strong> increasingly shut their doors, performers are finding new ways to showcase their talent, and in this case it\u2019s by taking their music to the streets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/24/most-important-dj-uk-live-streamer-takes-music-streets-ag-skepta\">In this great piece</a>, Larne Bakare talks to the DJs building fanbases by livestreaming performances in public spaces, from tube stations to traffic islands. <em><strong>Olivia Lee, newsletters team</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>As someone who was raised on <strong>Horrible Histories</strong>, I am so glad to see that it is <em>finally</em> being given a Bafta. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/24/15-years-of-horrible-histories-kids-tv-so-good-its-getting-a-bafta\">Michael Hogan sourced</a> 15 of the best moments of one of the most enduring children\u2019s television shows of the past two decades. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>It turns out that UK mobile users have the worst average 5G download speeds of all G7 countries. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/uk-5g-connection-really-is-crap-mobile-phones\">I enjoyed reading Chris Stokel-Walker</a> on why Britain\u2019s <strong>mobile phone coverage</strong> is so \u201cdecidedly crap.\u201d <em><strong>Olivia</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>The uncommitted vote in Michigan shocked the Democrats earlier this year but it was not enough to meaningfully change their foreign policy stance on <strong>Gaza</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/michigan-democrats-failed-gaza-voices-from-the-swing-states\">Mona Mawari writes</a> that this will cost them on polling day, which is less than two weeks away. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/24/im-a-creative-military-london-embraces-ghanaian-artist-michael-blebo\">In this article</a> we find out how Ghanaian artist <strong>Michael Bleblo</strong>, who was expected to join the military, was instead given a chance to follow his passion.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, doubled down yesterday, saying an interview: \u201cLook, I mean, we\u2019re not going to be paying out the reparations that some countries are speaking about.\u201d There was an expectation that the UK \u201cwould be more willing to move forward with the issue of reparations\u201d, Natricia says. Starmer asserted that he does not want to get stuck in a \u201cvery long endless discussion about reparations on the past\u201d and instead wishes to look forward and deal with current issues affecting the countries attending the summit, like the climate crisis, which is hitting countries in the global south, particularly smaller and island states, the hardest. But there is no way to separate these issues in the eyes of many of these states. The argument for reparations and reparatory justice is about tending to the enduring scars of transatlantic slavery on the social, economic and psychological outcomes of the region. \u201cCaribbean states are saying that this is not an issue that\u2019s in the past, it is something that is still having an impact on us,\u201d Natricia adds. Leaders will be heading to a retreat as part of the summit, where they will talk behind closed doors about the knottiest and most challenging issues of the summit, including reparations, away from the glare of the media. There is no way to know what will be said or the conclusions that will come out of these discussions, but it is clear that the initial offhand dismissal from the UK has not slowed down the movement. The Bahamas\u2019 foreign minister, Frederick Mitchell, told the BBC that it was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before Starmer \u201cchanges\u201d his position on reparations. \u201cCaribbean governments are very clear,\u201d says Natricia. \u201cThey are going to be stepping up this campaign. They feel that they have a legal and moral justification to do so.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading As pubs and music venues increasingly shut their doors, performers are finding new ways to showcase their talent, and in this case it\u2019s by taking their music to the streets.

Ahead of its release, here is a nice bit of publicity for the fans: a candid(ish) hour-long interview in which he opens up to entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson about becoming a dad at 83 with his 30-year-old (now former) partner, his surprising money problems, the roles he missed out on and, of course, his Shrek phone case. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <h2>Gardeners\u2019 World</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>Monty Don\u2019s on the garlic, checking on his planted supermarket version and adding two more varieties to complement it. The team\u2019s wider travels feature gorgeous autumn colours in Suffolk and a doctor in Devon who prescribes gardening as medicine. <strong>Jack Seale</strong></p> <h2>The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon \u2013 The Book of Carol</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>Safe haven the Nest \u2013 the real-life Mont-Saint-Michel, a towering abbey on a fortified islet \u2013 has given season two of this Walking Dead offshoot some unexpected architectural grandeur. But now it has been invaded by vengeful ideologue Genet and her forces, putting Daryl and pals very much on the back foot. <strong>Graeme Virtue</strong></p> <h2>The Cleaner</h2> <p><strong>9.30pm, BBC One</strong></p>    <p><strong><br></strong>All Wicky (Greg Davies) has to do this week is clean out a dead man\u2019s bedroom at a remote lighthouse. What could possibly go wrong? He has his trousers whipped down several times on the ferry, gets attacked by a gull as he tries to make friends with nature, and meets a grumpy lighthouse keeper (Conleth Hill), for starters. <strong>Hannah Verdier</strong></p> <h2>The Last Leg</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4 </strong><strong><br></strong>Show favourite Miriam Margolyes, comedian Phil Wang and Blur\u2019s Graham Coxon are the guests kickstarting another series of the topical late-night show. As ever, hosts Adam Hills, Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker will be trying to control the chaos. <strong>HR</strong></p> <h2>The Graham Norton Show</h2> <p><strong>10.40pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>It is a blockbuster night for Norton, with a sofa lineup including Paul Mescal and Denzel Washington, who co-star in the highly anticipated Gladiator II. Saoirse Ronan, the lead actor in Steve McQueen\u2019s wartime drama Blitz, and Eddie Redmayne, who is hitting the small screen in a TV adaptation of assassin thriller The Day of the Jackal, also appear. <strong>HR</strong></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin (Benjamin Ree, 2024)</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Netflix</strong></p>    <p>Benjamin Ree\u2019s documentary is a riposte to the idea that the internet is a corruptor of young minds. Mats Steen was a Norwegian with muscular dystrophy who died at 25. His parents mourned a life unlived, but didn\u2019t realise that the long hours Steen spent playing World of Warcraft led to many deep (albeit remote) friendships \u2013 and gave him a freedom of expression not possible in person. Using archive dialogue and actual WoW imagery, animators have recreated his secret virtual history.

      "bodyText": "Al Pacino: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 9pm, BBC Two Hollywood star Al Pacino, 84, has put his extraordinary life on paper in a memoir, Sonny Boy. Ahead of its release, here is a nice bit of publicity for the fans: a candid(ish) hour-long interview in which he opens up to entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson about becoming a dad at 83 with his 30-year-old (now former) partner, his surprising money problems, the roles he missed out on and, of course, his Shrek phone case. Hollie Richardson Gardeners\u2019 World 8pm, BBC Two Monty Don\u2019s on the garlic, checking on his planted supermarket version and adding two more varieties to complement it. The team\u2019s wider travels feature gorgeous autumn colours in Suffolk and a doctor in Devon who prescribes gardening as medicine. Jack Seale The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon \u2013 The Book of Carol 9pm, Sky Max Safe haven the Nest \u2013 the real-life Mont-Saint-Michel, a towering abbey on a fortified islet \u2013 has given season two of this Walking Dead offshoot some unexpected architectural grandeur. But now it has been invaded by vengeful ideologue Genet and her forces, putting Daryl and pals very much on the back foot. Graeme Virtue The Cleaner 9.30pm, BBC One All Wicky (Greg Davies) has to do this week is clean out a dead man\u2019s bedroom at a remote lighthouse. What could possibly go wrong? He has his trousers whipped down several times on the ferry, gets attacked by a gull as he tries to make friends with nature, and meets a grumpy lighthouse keeper (Conleth Hill), for starters. Hannah Verdier The Last Leg 10pm, Channel 4 Show favourite Miriam Margolyes, comedian Phil Wang and Blur\u2019s Graham Coxon are the guests kickstarting another series of the topical late-night show. As ever, hosts Adam Hills, Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker will be trying to control the chaos. HR The Graham Norton Show 10.40pm, BBC One It is a blockbuster night for Norton, with a sofa lineup including Paul Mescal and Denzel Washington, who co-star in the highly anticipated Gladiator II. Saoirse Ronan, the lead actor in Steve McQueen\u2019s wartime drama Blitz, and Eddie Redmayne, who is hitting the small screen in a TV adaptation of assassin thriller The Day of the Jackal, also appear. HR Film choice The Remarkable Life of Ibelin (Benjamin Ree, 2024), Netflix Benjamin Ree\u2019s documentary is a riposte to the idea that the internet is a corruptor of young minds. Mats Steen was a Norwegian with muscular dystrophy who died at 25. His parents mourned a life unlived, but didn\u2019t realise that the long hours Steen spent playing World of Warcraft led to many deep (albeit remote) friendships \u2013 and gave him a freedom of expression not possible in person. Using archive dialogue and actual WoW imagery, animators have recreated his secret virtual history. It is far from slick but feels utterly genuine as Steen\u2019s online community tell his immensely poignant story. Simon Wardell Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (Thom Zimny, 2024), Disney+ It\u2019s not a diary and there is not much road to be seen, but Thom Zimny\u2019s film about the Boss\u2019s 2023-24 tour (his first with the band since 2017) is a valuable souvenir of a group of musical pals who have been together, on and off, for 50 years.

A spokesperson for AstraZeneca denied the comments were made by their representative.</p> \n<p>The genetic codes of nature \u2013 which, when stored digitally, are known as digital sequence information (DSI) \u2013 are playing a growing role in new drug development in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.</p> \n<p>But there is widespread anger among biodiverse countries about how DSI is being used by multinational companies to develop commercial products \u2013 almost always for free. Most of the world\u2019s remaining biodiversity is concentrated in poorer countries. They argue that the free use of this genetic information <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/29/nature-biodiversity-genetic-digital-sequencing-information-dsi-biopiracy-cop16-aoe\">amounts to</a> \u201cbiopiracy\u201d, and say companies should share profits when indigenous species are used to develop commercial products.</p> \n<p>Global leaders have already <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-15/cop-15-dec-09-en.pdf\">agreed in principle</a> that these benefits should be shared more fairly. They are now<strong> </strong>gathered in Cali, Colombia, at the biodiversity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-16\">Cop16</a>, in negotiations over what form that sharing should take. </p> \n<p>Ideas under consideration include a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/30/cop15-faces-copenhagen-moment-genetic-data-dispute-aoe\">1% global tax</a> on profits of goods derived from DSI, which could cost the Cambridge-based company as much as $60m if enforced by the UK government [that figure represents an estimated maximum, as not all of the firm\u2019s profit would be derived from DSI].</p> \n<p>The profit-sharing proposals have prompted significant backlash from pharmaceutical companies. In March, AstraZeneca <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/astrazeneca-plans-650-million-investment-in-uk\">announced a \u00a3650m</a> investment in its UK operations, including \u00a3450m for its vaccine research and manufacturing facility in Liverpool. According to sources present at last week\u2019s meeting, however, a representative for the company said jobs in north-west England could be affected by any levy. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d400519e-c118-4338-b11d-34d868a15855\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is DSI?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Samples of natural organisms have been collected for scientific research for a long time. Now, their genetic codes are often most useful to researchers. This information is mostly exchanged online, via huge databases that store digitised versions of genetic codes.

The reaction that powers Covid-19 tests, for example, was developed using <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC249935/\">heat-resistant</a> bacteria from a Yellowstone geyser.

Many of those countries object to companies and researchers using their native biodiversity without paying for it: they call it \u201cbio-piracy\u201d. At the Cop16 UN biodiversity summit in October 2024, world leaders are attempting to negotiate an agreement over the sharing of resources from DSI.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Without a global agreement on how revenue is shared from discoveries based on DSI, some countries have threatened to restrict access to their biodiversity \u2013 potentially a major blow for commercial and scientific research.

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has said it may cut jobs at its UK operation if the government enforces a global push to make companies share profits derived from nature\u2019s genetic codes, multiple sources have told the Guardian. The alleged comments from the company came amid a concerted lobbying push by the pharmaceutical industry against the profit-sharing measures. Sources told the Guardian that the British-Swedish biotech company \u2013 which made $5.96bn (\u00a34.59bn) profit last year \u2013 made the comments during a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs roundtable meeting last week to discuss a proposed new global levy on drugs derived from the digital forms of biodiversity. A spokesperson for AstraZeneca denied the comments were made by their representative. The genetic codes of nature \u2013 which, when stored digitally, are known as digital sequence information (DSI) \u2013 are playing a growing role in new drug development in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. But there is widespread anger among biodiverse countries about how DSI is being used by multinational companies to develop commercial products \u2013 almost always for free. Most of the world\u2019s remaining biodiversity is concentrated in poorer countries. They argue that the free use of this genetic information amounts to \u201cbiopiracy\u201d, and say companies should share profits when indigenous species are used to develop commercial products. Global leaders have already agreed in principle that these benefits should be shared more fairly. They are now gathered in Cali, Colombia, at the biodiversity Cop16, in negotiations over what form that sharing should take. Ideas under consideration include a 1% global tax on profits of goods derived from DSI, which could cost the Cambridge-based company as much as $60m if enforced by the UK government [that figure represents an estimated maximum, as not all of the firm\u2019s profit would be derived from DSI]. The profit-sharing proposals have prompted significant backlash from pharmaceutical companies. In March, AstraZeneca announced a \u00a3650m investment in its UK operations, including \u00a3450m for its vaccine research and manufacturing facility in Liverpool. According to sources present at last week\u2019s meeting, however, a representative for the company said jobs in north-west England could be affected by any levy. Without a global agreement on how revenue is shared from discoveries based on DSI, some countries have threatened to restrict access to their biodiversity \u2013 potentially a major blow for commercial and scientific research. Proceeds from the global fund would be used for nature conservation around the world in an effort to prevent the continued destruction of ecosystems. Eva Zabey, chief executive of Business for Nature, said making progress on DSI at the Cop16 negotiations was essential. \u201cNature underpins every aspect of our economy. The benefits of natural resources \u2013 including through digital sequencing \u2013 must be valued and shared fairly. Businesses have a responsibility to contribute financially and non-financially for their use of these resources,\u201d she said. While any DSI levy would be voluntary, governments are free to implement compulsory national measures, an approach that is under consideration by the UK government. At the Defra meeting on 15 October, pharmaceutical industry representatives voiced strong opposition to the idea and said a compulsory levy would damage competitiveness with countries such as the US, which is not a signatory to the UN biodiversity process and would not introduce any levy. Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, who attended the Defra meeting, said the imposition of a compulsory levy for UK-based companies was \u201ca poorly targeted and damaging response to a critical global challenge\u201d. \u201cIt would discourage the use of this vital data, stifling British research efforts into vital to public health concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cAny multilateral benefit-sharing mechanism must promote conservation objectives alongside scientific innovation and economic growth. The proposals on the table at Cop16 for a compulsory levy do not achieve this. \u201cThey will have a direct impact on UK innovation, investment and growth, made worse by the fact that key nations such as the US will not impose a levy, putting the UK at an active disadvantage in attracting cutting-edge medical research,\u201d he said. Ahead of the negotiations in Cali, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations (IFPMA), said it had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about a proposed global DSI tax, and that it could further complicate research. Steve Bates, chief executive of the UK Bioindustry Association, said: \u201cAny rules or levies that come from this summit will be imposing barriers to innovation and business growth \u2026 We have already discussed this with the UK government delegation going to Colombia.\u201d International DSI negotiations at Cop16 are expected to conclude on Friday next week. A spokesperson for AstraZeneca said it may be the case that others in the room at the meeting on 15 October who represent the industry may have made comments about the impact on companies. \u201cI can confirm that no AstraZeneca representative made threats to move operations or cut jobs. As a company we are aligned with the position set out by the IFPMA which can be found here,\u201d they said.

      "body": "<p>A council destroyed the belongings of a tenant who went missing, after banning his family from entering his flat.</p> <p>Robert Bracegirdle, 75, disappeared from his home in Goole in 2020 after struggling with mental health issues. A police search failed to find him and a coroner later ruled that he had died by drowning in the nearby River Ouse.</p> <p>His next of kin were forbidden access to his flat by East Riding council which promised to store his possessions until he was officially declared dead. However, when an inquest was held two years after his disappearance, the family discovered that the contents of his flat had been disposed of.</p> <p>\u201cThe council told us that we were not allowed to enter the flat and remove any items because my uncle could not give permission,\u201d said his niece, Charlotte Bracegirdle.</p> <p>\u201cIt said that once it had repossessed the property through the courts, it would take a full inventory of the contents and put them into storage until an inquest. My mum contacted them when an inquest date was set and received a two-line email, which didn\u2019t even address her by name, stating that the contents had been disposed of as is \u2018standard procedure\u2019 when a property has stood empty for a long period. We suspect some of the more high-value items may have been sold.\u201d</p> <p>The family, who live in London and did not have a key to the flat, say that the council has refused to tell them what happened to the items, which included family heirlooms and sensitive documents.</p> <p>Bracegirdle\u2019s niece Charlotte said personal items were destroyed that were important to the family, including a games table that Robert and his siblings had initialled and given to their father when he retired.</p> <p>\u201cThis was one item I so wanted to cherish, along with a tapestry made by my grandmother and five paintings I\u2019d given him. The police were not allowed to give us his phone and iPad until a death certificate had been issued following the inquest, so we don\u2019t know how the council was able to throw all his belongings.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian recently reported on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/08/family-of-deceased-tenant-refused-entry-to-property-containing-lifes-work\">daughters of a deceased council tenant who were barred from his flat</a> and told the contents may be disposed of.</p> <p>According to the housing law specialist Giles Peaker, partner of Anthony Gold Solicitors, relatives of council tenants who die without having made a will usually have to wait for a grant of probate before they can enter a property. However, in Bracegirdle\u2019s case, probate could not be applied for until he was officially declared dead two years later, by which time his property had been disposed of.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the Tort (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 the council would have to keep the deceased tenant\u2019s belongings secure and serve a notice on the administrator, executor and/or on the public trustee requiring collection of the belongings before disposing of them. It appears that something has gone very wrong here,\u201d Peaker said.</p> <p>East Riding council declined to respond to questions about when and how Bracegirdle\u2019s belongings were disposed of.</p> <p>It said in a statement: \u201cThe council offers our deepest condolences, and regrets that the council\u2019s actions caused distress at a difficult time for Mr Bracegirdle\u2019s family. We acknowledge, now and at the time, that matters should have been dealt in a more sympathetic way. In response to the concerns that the family members have raised, we have changed our processes to ensure that similar cases are managed in a more sensitive way. This case is currently being dealt with by our insurers so we cannot comment in more detail at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Bracegirdle\u2019s sister, Christina Bracegirlde, said she had not received an apology and had to contact the council repeatedly for answers that never came.</p> <p>\u201cTheir curt responses have shown no understanding of our loss and have added to the grief of a family whose much-loved brother and uncle probably took his own life,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have stolen memories from us as if my brother was of no value.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A council destroyed the belongings of a tenant who went missing, after banning his family from entering his flat. Robert Bracegirdle, 75, disappeared from his home in Goole in 2020 after struggling with mental health issues. A police search failed to find him and a coroner later ruled that he had died by drowning in the nearby River Ouse. His next of kin were forbidden access to his flat by East Riding council which promised to store his possessions until he was officially declared dead. However, when an inquest was held two years after his disappearance, the family discovered that the contents of his flat had been disposed of. \u201cThe council told us that we were not allowed to enter the flat and remove any items because my uncle could not give permission,\u201d said his niece, Charlotte Bracegirdle. \u201cIt said that once it had repossessed the property through the courts, it would take a full inventory of the contents and put them into storage until an inquest. My mum contacted them when an inquest date was set and received a two-line email, which didn\u2019t even address her by name, stating that the contents had been disposed of as is \u2018standard procedure\u2019 when a property has stood empty for a long period. We suspect some of the more high-value items may have been sold.\u201d The family, who live in London and did not have a key to the flat, say that the council has refused to tell them what happened to the items, which included family heirlooms and sensitive documents. Bracegirdle\u2019s niece Charlotte said personal items were destroyed that were important to the family, including a games table that Robert and his siblings had initialled and given to their father when he retired. \u201cThis was one item I so wanted to cherish, along with a tapestry made by my grandmother and five paintings I\u2019d given him. The police were not allowed to give us his phone and iPad until a death certificate had been issued following the inquest, so we don\u2019t know how the council was able to throw all his belongings.\u201d The Guardian recently reported on daughters of a deceased council tenant who were barred from his flat and told the contents may be disposed of. According to the housing law specialist Giles Peaker, partner of Anthony Gold Solicitors, relatives of council tenants who die without having made a will usually have to wait for a grant of probate before they can enter a property. However, in Bracegirdle\u2019s case, probate could not be applied for until he was officially declared dead two years later, by which time his property had been disposed of. \u201cUnder the Tort (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 the council would have to keep the deceased tenant\u2019s belongings secure and serve a notice on the administrator, executor and/or on the public trustee requiring collection of the belongings before disposing of them. It appears that something has gone very wrong here,\u201d Peaker said. East Riding council declined to respond to questions about when and how Bracegirdle\u2019s belongings were disposed of. It said in a statement: \u201cThe council offers our deepest condolences, and regrets that the council\u2019s actions caused distress at a difficult time for Mr Bracegirdle\u2019s family. We acknowledge, now and at the time, that matters should have been dealt in a more sympathetic way. In response to the concerns that the family members have raised, we have changed our processes to ensure that similar cases are managed in a more sensitive way. This case is currently being dealt with by our insurers so we cannot comment in more detail at this time.\u201d Bracegirdle\u2019s sister, Christina Bracegirlde, said she had not received an apology and had to contact the council repeatedly for answers that never came. \u201cTheir curt responses have shown no understanding of our loss and have added to the grief of a family whose much-loved brother and uncle probably took his own life,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have stolen memories from us as if my brother was of no value.\u201d",

But, as a foreign national, I would be committing a federal offence by donating, and the Harris campaign would be doing the same by accepting one. So I cheer from the sidelines and stay within the rules.</p> <p>It would be surprising if nobody at the Labour party stopped to ask themselves similar questions. But they should have done.

      "body": "<p>Worsening relations between the United Nations and Israel appear to have reached a nadir with the imminent passage of a bill in the Israeli Knesset designed to make it impossible for the UN relief and works agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) to operate in Gaza and West Bank.</p> <p>Unrwa has long been a target of Israel, predating its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/20/first-edition-israel-unrwa\">claims that up to 12 members of the group\u2019s staff took part in the 7 October attacks</a> , but the move to ban the agency altogether signals a fresh polarisation that may take years to reverse.</p> <p>The consequences of a major US ally in the Middle East being largely contemptuous of the UN and the international legal institutions it upholds are likely to be long-lasting and profound.</p> <p>In a sign of support for the bills, the former defence minister Benny Gantz accused Unrwa of choosing \u201cto make itself an inseparable component of Hamas\u2019s mechanism \u2013 and now is the time to detach ourselves entirely from it \u2026 Instead of fulfilling its purpose and improving the lives of refugees, Unrwa does the opposite and perpetuates their victimisation.\u201d</p> <p>The west has had doubts about aspects of Unrwa \u2018s neutrality but still sees it as the best body available to deliver aid, education and health to Palestinians. If the Knesset succeeds in shutting down the organisation, the question of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/22/obstacles-to-gaza-aid-deliveries-visual-guide\">how to channel aid to 2.4 million people in Gaza and the West Bank </a>will become acute. </p> <p>The crisis is imminent. Two bills passed on 6 October by the Knesset\u2019s foreign affairs and defence committee will probably go to the Knesset plenum by 28 October, according to Adalah, a legal centre for Arab minority rights in Israel. The measures look to have a cross-party majority of about 100 of the 120 members.</p> <p>One of the bills seeks to ban Unrwa from operating within Israel\u2019s sovereign territory, stating that the agency \u201cshall not establish any representation, provide any services or conduct any activities within the territory of Israel\u201d. This would lead to closure of the Unrwa headquarters in East Jerusalem and end visas for Unrwa staff. The proposal, which Adalah claims would be a breach of international court of justice orders directing Israel to cooperate with the UN over the delivery of humanitarian supplies, would come into force within three months of the bill\u2019s passage.</p> <p>Although the plan has been condemned widely \u2013 including by ambassadors from 123 member states \u2013 it is probably only Washington that can persuade Israel to rethink. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, issued a joint letter warning that \u201cenacting such restrictions would devastate the humanitarian response in Gaza at this critical moment and deny essential educational and social services to tens of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem\u201d. The statement was issued even though the US Congress has not yet agreed to restore its funding to Unrwa, unlike every other western nation.</p> <p>Ironically, until the 7 October attacks the relationship between Unrwa and Israel was one of necessary respect since, at one level, the agency carried out the relief work that an occupying power itself should do. As such it took a burden off Israel.</p>    <p>Unrwa\u2019s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, insists he acted decisively by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/05/nine-unrwa-staff-members-may-have-been-involved-in-7-october-attack\">firing the relevant staff after a review of the allegations of involvement in the attack were published</a>and in implementing the recommendations of a subsequent report by the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna.</p> <p>Unrwa also points out that successive Israeli efforts to deliver aid through alternative routes have failed.

      "bodyText": "Worsening relations between the United Nations and Israel appear to have reached a nadir with the imminent passage of a bill in the Israeli Knesset designed to make it impossible for the UN relief and works agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) to operate in Gaza and West Bank. Unrwa has long been a target of Israel, predating its claims that up to 12 members of the group\u2019s staff took part in the 7 October attacks , but the move to ban the agency altogether signals a fresh polarisation that may take years to reverse. The consequences of a major US ally in the Middle East being largely contemptuous of the UN and the international legal institutions it upholds are likely to be long-lasting and profound. In a sign of support for the bills, the former defence minister Benny Gantz accused Unrwa of choosing \u201cto make itself an inseparable component of Hamas\u2019s mechanism \u2013 and now is the time to detach ourselves entirely from it \u2026 Instead of fulfilling its purpose and improving the lives of refugees, Unrwa does the opposite and perpetuates their victimisation.\u201d The west has had doubts about aspects of Unrwa \u2018s neutrality but still sees it as the best body available to deliver aid, education and health to Palestinians. If the Knesset succeeds in shutting down the organisation, the question of how to channel aid to 2.4 million people in Gaza and the West Bank will become acute. The crisis is imminent. Two bills passed on 6 October by the Knesset\u2019s foreign affairs and defence committee will probably go to the Knesset plenum by 28 October, according to Adalah, a legal centre for Arab minority rights in Israel. The measures look to have a cross-party majority of about 100 of the 120 members. One of the bills seeks to ban Unrwa from operating within Israel\u2019s sovereign territory, stating that the agency \u201cshall not establish any representation, provide any services or conduct any activities within the territory of Israel\u201d. This would lead to closure of the Unrwa headquarters in East Jerusalem and end visas for Unrwa staff. The proposal, which Adalah claims would be a breach of international court of justice orders directing Israel to cooperate with the UN over the delivery of humanitarian supplies, would come into force within three months of the bill\u2019s passage. Although the plan has been condemned widely \u2013 including by ambassadors from 123 member states \u2013 it is probably only Washington that can persuade Israel to rethink. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, issued a joint letter warning that \u201cenacting such restrictions would devastate the humanitarian response in Gaza at this critical moment and deny essential educational and social services to tens of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem\u201d. The statement was issued even though the US Congress has not yet agreed to restore its funding to Unrwa, unlike every other western nation. Ironically, until the 7 October attacks the relationship between Unrwa and Israel was one of necessary respect since, at one level, the agency carried out the relief work that an occupying power itself should do. As such it took a burden off Israel. Unrwa\u2019s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, insists he acted decisively by firing the relevant staff after a review of the allegations of involvement in the attack were publishedand in implementing the recommendations of a subsequent report by the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna. Unrwa also points out that successive Israeli efforts to deliver aid through alternative routes have failed. No other UN agency has the ability to take on the breadth of Unrwa\u2019s work, it is argued. But, as throughout the region, Israel has signalled it is determined to change the rules of the game, and that involves no longer tolerating what it sees as UN interference. In a choice between international law and a risk to Israel\u2019s security, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, insists \u201cbetter a bad press than a good eulogy\u201d. The roots of UN-Israeli tensions go much deeper. Israel for years has accused the UN of being a cesspit of antisemitism. As long ago as 1984 Netanyahu said he regarded his mission as Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN as trying to light the candle of truth in a house of darkness. In 1987, the British diplomat Brian Urquhart, former UN under secretary for special political affairs, lamented that \u201cthe UN\u2019s involvement in the question of Palestine has twisted the organisation\u2019s image and fragmented its reputation and prestige, as no other nation has\u201d. One reason was touched upon in a reported remark by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, a fortnight ago. He was quoted as saying Israel should abide by UN resolutions since it was the UN that had created the state of Israel in 1947, an observation that led to a torrent of criticism from Netanyahu and French Jewish groups. G\u00e9rard Araud, the former French ambassador to the UN, sprang to Macron\u2019s defence by saying the reaction to the president\u2019s remarks had been \u201castonishing since it is an undeniable fact: the state of Israel was created by resolution 181 of the UN general assembly of 29 November, 1947. This perception of the birth of the creation of Israel \u2013 a birth that did not go as the UN intended \u2013 has given the body a special sense of responsibility to rectify what many member states regard as an error. By contrast it is anathema to many Israelis that they should feel the need to be grateful or even deferential to the UN. Ever since, an expanded and increasingly post-colonial UN has felt a responsibility to right what many members regard as an injustice of its own making.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has been working tirelessly to win over male voters and by some measures his efforts appear effective, but it may have come at the cost of female support. According to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll, Trump is besting Kamala Harris among men by 53% to 37%, while the Democratic candidate is winning among women 53% to 36%. But despite multiple polls showing the gender gap among voters widening to historic levels, Harris has said she doesn\u2019t see the phenomenon borne out at her rallies. \u201cWhat I am seeing is in equal measure, men and women talking about their concerns about the future of our democracy.\u201d Both Harris and her Republican challenger spent the past day at rallies across battleground states. With only days to go until the election, a poll from Bloomberg News and Morning Consult finds that the 2024 presidential race is still too close to call. Here\u2019s what else happened on Thursday: Kamala Harris election news Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama appeared alongside Harris at a star-studded campaign event in Clarkston, Georgia. The event launched the Democratic campaign\u2019s series of battleground state concerts. The actor Samuel L Jackson, director Spike Lee, senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, and actor Tyler Perry also spoke at the rally. About 20,000 people attended the Georgia event, according to the Harris campaign, which would make it her largest political rally yet. Bruce Springsteen urged voters to back Harris in the presidential election, warning that Trump is a would-be \u201ctyrant\u201d. Early voting totals have been breaking records in Georgia, with about 30% of the electorate having already cast ballots. Beyonc\u00e9 will reportedly join Harris at her rally in Houston on Friday, continuing the celebrity pile-in. Harris is rallying in Texas, a Republican stronghold, to highlight abortion rights and support the Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred, who trails the Republican Ted Cruz in opinion polls. Harris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans: one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. The former congressman Fred Upton said Trump was \u201ctotally unhinged\u201d, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t need this chaos. We need to move forward, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m where I am.\u201d Donald Trump election news Trump said he would order the immediate firing of the special counsel Jack Smith if he were re-elected in the clearest expression of his intent to shut down the two criminal cases brought against him. The power to fire the special counsel formally rests with the attorney general, but Trump has made no secret of his intention to appoint a loyalist in that role. Trump, campaigning in the border swing state of Arizona, called the country a \u201cgarbage can\u201d because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. He laid out a host of policies including invoking the death penalty for any migrant who kills an American citizen and hiring 10,000 more border agents and increasing their pay. Later, Trump appeared at another rally organised by the conservative group Turning Point Action in Nevada. The United for Change event in Las Vegas drew thousands of supporters. The group, founded by conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk to engage young conservatives, has been working to help turn out voters on Trump\u2019s behalf. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Mail-in ballots have been damaged after a man set fire to a postal collection box in Arizona. Phoenix police arrested Dieter Klofkorn, who admitted to the crime and said his actions were not politically motivated. Elon Musk gave another $44m to his pro-Donald Trump spending group during the first half of October, federal disclosures showed. The contributions, disclosed in a filing to the Federal Election Commission by Musk\u2019s America PAC group, come after a prior report showed he gave the group around $75m over three months between July and September.

      "body": "<p>Chris Stapleton has played five arenas in the UK over the past week, on a tour dubbed the All-American Road Show. Posters depicted his grandly bearded, cowboy-hatted visage framed by hills and skies in colours of red, white and blue. At first listen, his country music seems just as all-American. The 46-year-old has been writing and singing about women, heartbreak and drinkin\u2019 for more than 20 years \u2013 whiskey alone has prompted Tennessee Whiskey (originally recorded by David Allan Coe), Whiskey and You, Whiskey Sunrise and his version of Willie Nelson\u2019s Whiskey River; Stapleton recently launched his <a href=\"https://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/our-brands/traveller-whiskey.html?srsltid=AfmBOoroJnCleYKh6hcOQTt7cQDU9rlmdoXC6RNSJWU6nd10udiegptX\">own brand</a> of the stuff, Traveller. He\u2019s sung the national anthem at the Super Bowl, and duetted with Taylor Swift. When discussing the upcoming election in November, I can almost hear a bald eagle cry as he declares: \u201cI\u2019m voting for America and a good glass of whiskey.\u201d</p> <p>But Stapleton, a true American superstar with 10 Grammys and 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify, is rather more complicated than your average truck-drivin\u2019 country singer \u2013 and he\u2019s all too aware of the stereotypes. His atmospheric 2020 song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzqskyzdWJw&amp;amp;ab_channel=ChrisStapletonVEVO\">Hillbilly Blood</a> is less a country number and more a string of southern-gothic vignettes, \u201cborn out of a riff that sounded pretty mean\u201d, and inspired by his native Kentucky. \u201cThe people where I\u2019m from, sometimes we\u2019re looked down upon as not as educated or not as smart, or that we don\u2019t have much money, or any of those things,\u201d he says.</p> <p>On his biggest recent hit, White Horse, he sounds like a classically macho country-rocker \u2013 until you realise he\u2019s running away from love, too afraid to be a heroic \u201ccowboy on a white horse / ridin\u2019 off into the sunset\u201d. As well as the Swift duet, there\u2019s another with Metallica. And while country peers such as Jason Aldean have recently been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-rightwing-embrace\">dealing in aggressive nationalism</a>, Stapleton is writing songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS7vZLhwf_o&amp;amp;ab_channel=ChrisStapletonVEVO\">Watch You Burn</a>, a furious anthem about the 2017 mass shooting at Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas, where 60 people were killed.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s important that you write songs sometimes that are timely,\u201d he says, over the phone. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our duty as songwriters, to connect with people in those ways: anger and frustration.\u201d</p>    <p>He certainly has the quintessential country roots, though: while Loretta Lynn sang of being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9eHp7JJgq8\">a coalminer\u2019s daughter</a>, Stapleton is a coalminer\u2019s son, and his mother worked at the local health department. He grew up in Staffordsville, a small, \u201cthree stoplight\u201d rural town, where \u201cthe Friday night football game was the big gathering of the week, then it was church on Sundays. That was kind of it.\u201d</p> <p>His earliest musical memories are of playing guitar with his uncle, and of his dad playing outlaw country and old R&amp;B in the car. \u201cWhen my mom wasn\u2019t in the car it would be a little louder than it should have been for children, probably,\u201d says Stapleton. \u201cBut he loved to listen to music, and a lot of my love for my music probably comes from that.\u201d</p> <p>He went to Nashville to study biomedical engineering at Vanderbilt University<strong>,</strong> then switched to business school, but he \u201cjust didn\u2019t have an interest in doing any of that \u2013 a very strong disinterest, in fact\u201d. Having taught himself guitar to a decent standard, he realised he could have a career in music when he met a salaried songwriter at EMI around the turn of the millennium. \u201cI had no idea that was a job,\u201d he says. He assumed if someone was singing a song, they wrote it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there was an entire community of people who, behind the scenes, were kind of song-factories. I became enamoured with that very quickly, and said: \u2018Well, this is the job that I need to have.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>Over the next decade or so, Stapleton earned a reputation as a prolific, versatile songwriter for country stars old (Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, George Strait), and new (Luke Bryan, Dierks Bentley, Blake Shelton). In 2015, he even had the great honour of seeing a song he\u2019d co-written with Thomas Rhett, South Side, performed by animated rodents in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. Stapleton had become another of Nashville\u2019s song factories \u2013 he reckons he\u2019s written more than 1,000 of them \u2013 but he never felt \u201clike a cog in a machine. That\u2019s not very romantic or sexy, but it <em>was</em> romantic. To get to dig in with all the people that I had gotten to dig in with \u2013 the best of the best in the country music songwriter world \u2013 was a real privilege: \u2018the art behind the art\u2019 kinda thing.\u201d</p> <p>In this environment, Stapleton never felt compelled to perform himself \u2013 \u201cWhy would I? \u2013 but he had a number of \u201cperfectly good songs sitting around going to waste\u201d. So he formed a bluegrass band to play them called the SteelDrivers, followed by southern rockers the Jompson Brothers, before going solo. \u201cMy wife thought I was crazy because it was an income hit to go on tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably gave up 40% of my income just because I wasn\u2019t working as hard at songwriting.\u201d</p> <p>The title track of Stapleton\u2019s debut album, Traveller, was composed while he and his wife, the singer-songwriter <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2NMDcLqpSDPcPA3OMitdnX\">Morgane Stapleton</a>, drove through New Mexico in 2013 (they met while working in adjacent publishing houses, married in 2007 and now have five children). The road trip had been her idea: she spent $10,000 on a Jeep in Phoenix, Arizona, and the 1,600-mile drive back to Nashville would be a welcome distraction for Stapleton, whose father had just died. \u201cThe whole record in a lot of ways was dedicated to him,\u201d says Stapleton. \u201cI tried to make a record that I thought he would have liked to have heard be made. I miss my father a great deal \u2013 he never got to see what we\u2019re doing now. Never got to even have a notion of that. And you know, I find that difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Traveller initially made little headway on mainstream country radio. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t singles-based,\u201d Stapleton says. \u201cWe were just going to play shows on it, and that was unusual.\u201d But then came the 2015 Country Music Association Awards. A 37-year-old Stapleton took to the stage with Morgane and Justin Timberlake for a performance of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRyq3oGqXTQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=DennisMellon\">Stapleton\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey and Timberlake\u2019s Drink You Away</a>. Stapleton\u2019s soulful crooning and brooding stage presence were electric, and the audience were stunned.

      "bodyText": "Chris Stapleton has played five arenas in the UK over the past week, on a tour dubbed the All-American Road Show. Posters depicted his grandly bearded, cowboy-hatted visage framed by hills and skies in colours of red, white and blue. At first listen, his country music seems just as all-American. The 46-year-old has been writing and singing about women, heartbreak and drinkin\u2019 for more than 20 years \u2013 whiskey alone has prompted Tennessee Whiskey (originally recorded by David Allan Coe), Whiskey and You, Whiskey Sunrise and his version of Willie Nelson\u2019s Whiskey River; Stapleton recently launched his own brand of the stuff, Traveller. He\u2019s sung the national anthem at the Super Bowl, and duetted with Taylor Swift. When discussing the upcoming election in November, I can almost hear a bald eagle cry as he declares: \u201cI\u2019m voting for America and a good glass of whiskey.\u201d But Stapleton, a true American superstar with 10 Grammys and 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify, is rather more complicated than your average truck-drivin\u2019 country singer \u2013 and he\u2019s all too aware of the stereotypes. His atmospheric 2020 song Hillbilly Blood is less a country number and more a string of southern-gothic vignettes, \u201cborn out of a riff that sounded pretty mean\u201d, and inspired by his native Kentucky. \u201cThe people where I\u2019m from, sometimes we\u2019re looked down upon as not as educated or not as smart, or that we don\u2019t have much money, or any of those things,\u201d he says. On his biggest recent hit, White Horse, he sounds like a classically macho country-rocker \u2013 until you realise he\u2019s running away from love, too afraid to be a heroic \u201ccowboy on a white horse / ridin\u2019 off into the sunset\u201d. As well as the Swift duet, there\u2019s another with Metallica. And while country peers such as Jason Aldean have recently been dealing in aggressive nationalism, Stapleton is writing songs like Watch You Burn, a furious anthem about the 2017 mass shooting at Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas, where 60 people were killed. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you write songs sometimes that are timely,\u201d he says, over the phone. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our duty as songwriters, to connect with people in those ways: anger and frustration.\u201d He certainly has the quintessential country roots, though: while Loretta Lynn sang of being a coalminer\u2019s daughter, Stapleton is a coalminer\u2019s son, and his mother worked at the local health department. He grew up in Staffordsville, a small, \u201cthree stoplight\u201d rural town, where \u201cthe Friday night football game was the big gathering of the week, then it was church on Sundays. That was kind of it.\u201d His earliest musical memories are of playing guitar with his uncle, and of his dad playing outlaw country and old R&amp;B in the car. \u201cWhen my mom wasn\u2019t in the car it would be a little louder than it should have been for children, probably,\u201d says Stapleton. \u201cBut he loved to listen to music, and a lot of my love for my music probably comes from that.\u201d He went to Nashville to study biomedical engineering at Vanderbilt University, then switched to business school, but he \u201cjust didn\u2019t have an interest in doing any of that \u2013 a very strong disinterest, in fact\u201d. Having taught himself guitar to a decent standard, he realised he could have a career in music when he met a salaried songwriter at EMI around the turn of the millennium. \u201cI had no idea that was a job,\u201d he says. He assumed if someone was singing a song, they wrote it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there was an entire community of people who, behind the scenes, were kind of song-factories. I became enamoured with that very quickly, and said: \u2018Well, this is the job that I need to have.\u2019\u201d Over the next decade or so, Stapleton earned a reputation as a prolific, versatile songwriter for country stars old (Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, George Strait), and new (Luke Bryan, Dierks Bentley, Blake Shelton). In 2015, he even had the great honour of seeing a song he\u2019d co-written with Thomas Rhett, South Side, performed by animated rodents in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. Stapleton had become another of Nashville\u2019s song factories \u2013 he reckons he\u2019s written more than 1,000 of them \u2013 but he never felt \u201clike a cog in a machine. That\u2019s not very romantic or sexy, but it was romantic. To get to dig in with all the people that I had gotten to dig in with \u2013 the best of the best in the country music songwriter world \u2013 was a real privilege: \u2018the art behind the art\u2019 kinda thing.\u201d In this environment, Stapleton never felt compelled to perform himself \u2013 \u201cWhy would I? \u2013 but he had a number of \u201cperfectly good songs sitting around going to waste\u201d. So he formed a bluegrass band to play them called the SteelDrivers, followed by southern rockers the Jompson Brothers, before going solo. \u201cMy wife thought I was crazy because it was an income hit to go on tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably gave up 40% of my income just because I wasn\u2019t working as hard at songwriting.\u201d The title track of Stapleton\u2019s debut album, Traveller, was composed while he and his wife, the singer-songwriter Morgane Stapleton, drove through New Mexico in 2013 (they met while working in adjacent publishing houses, married in 2007 and now have five children). The road trip had been her idea: she spent $10,000 on a Jeep in Phoenix, Arizona, and the 1,600-mile drive back to Nashville would be a welcome distraction for Stapleton, whose father had just died. \u201cThe whole record in a lot of ways was dedicated to him,\u201d says Stapleton. \u201cI tried to make a record that I thought he would have liked to have heard be made. I miss my father a great deal \u2013 he never got to see what we\u2019re doing now. Never got to even have a notion of that. And you know, I find that difficult.\u201d Traveller initially made little headway on mainstream country radio. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t singles-based,\u201d Stapleton says. \u201cWe were just going to play shows on it, and that was unusual.\u201d But then came the 2015 Country Music Association Awards. A 37-year-old Stapleton took to the stage with Morgane and Justin Timberlake for a performance of Stapleton\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey and Timberlake\u2019s Drink You Away. Stapleton\u2019s soulful crooning and brooding stage presence were electric, and the audience were stunned. The day prior, he still had a number of gigs with half-sold tickets. \u201cThe next day, they were all gone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe knew there was a different ballgame, for sure.\u201d Traveller re-entered the Billboard album chart at No 1, and has now sold more than 6m copies in the US. Stapleton\u2019s breakthrough came at a time when Nashville was dominated by bro-country; the upbeat, poppy sub-genre preoccupied with trucks, women, beer and partying, sung by young men in double denim. Labels and listeners longed for something fresh, and Stapleton\u2019s music \u2013 a cocktail of rock, Americana, bluegrass, R&amp;B and soul, with a rare vulnerability in his lyrics and a raw expressiveness in his voice \u2013 was what everyone was looking for, as was his look: part biker, part throwback to the outlaw country stars of the 70s. He believes the essence of country music is \u201cstories\u201d, and the Grammy-winning You Should Probably Leave is one example of his own talent in that regard: as two former lovers try and fail to resist temptation, the song crackles with shame and erotic tension. Stapleton became that rare thing: a crossover country superstar. Ed Sheeran and Adele called on him as a collaborator. Bus-loads of tourists began arriving outside his house in Nashville twice a day (\u201cthat felt a little unnerving\u201d), while one fan drove two states over \u201cand just kind of showed up in my driveway.

She has an overabundance of pride.\u201d And did you win that night? \u201cProbably!\u201d he says, laughing. By 2023, a GQ headline was asking \u201cIs Chris Stapleton the one thing America could agree on?\u201d, and for all that he trades in occasionally angry and even subversive songwriting, he has cultivated universal admiration by being very even-handed. Of the pressure celebrities are under to endorse a presidential candidate, he says: \u201cI\u2019m not saying celebrities shouldn\u2019t endorse people \u2013 that\u2019s American.

Asked whether country music has issues with intolerance or sexism \u2013 last year country chart-topper Maren Morris distanced herself from the scene because of its misogyny and participation in culture wars \u2013 he has a politician\u2019s non-specific condemnation: \u201cThere\u2019s intolerance and sexism everywhere \u2026 you\u2019re kidding yourself if you think those things don\u2019t exist.\u201d To Stapleton, American values are about \u201cfairness and defending those who can\u2019t defend themselves, or standing up for each other\u201d, he says. \u201cAbout coming together, understanding points of view that aren\u2019t yours.

      "body": "<p>Maria Sole Giardini was campaigning outside the Italian parliament in 2021 for surrogacy to be legalised when she encountered Giorgia Meloni.</p> <p>The current prime minister\u2019s Brothers of Italy party, in opposition at the time, was frantically drumming up support <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159570020367645&amp;id=38919827644&amp;set=a.10151958645677645&amp;locale=hi_IN\">for a bill</a> to extend Italy\u2019s outright ban on domestic surrogacy by making it a universal crime that transcends borders.</p> <p>This would have put people like Giardini, who was born without a womb and whose only means of having a baby was to access surrogacy abroad, on a par with terrorists, paedophiles and war criminals.</p> <p>Meloni, who refers to surrogacy using the derogatory term \u201cutero in affitto\u201d (womb for rent), had described it that year as an \u201cabomination\u201d that sought to reduce human life \u201cto a bargaining chip\u201d.</p> <p>Still, she took a moment to speak to Giardini, who is among the estimated 6,000 women in Italy with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome, a condition that affects the female reproductive system.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I explained the condition and asked her \u2018Why won\u2019t you let me become a mother?\u2019, she seemed open to wanting to evaluate surrogacy in certain situations, and we both agreed that women shouldn\u2019t be exploited and that the service should be voluntary,\u201d Giardini said.</p> <p>Last week, almost two years to the day that Meloni\u2019s far-right government came to power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/italy-makes-it-to-seek-surrogacy-treatment-abroad\">parliament approved</a> the west\u2019s<strong> </strong>most restrictive law against international surrogacy. Under the terms of the law, which makes surrogacy the universal crime Meloni had campaigned for, couples who go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy risk up to two years in jail and fines of between \u20ac600,000 and \u20ac1m.</p> <p>\u201cThe moment she became prime minister [in 2022] she pushed ahead with this inhumane and wicked law without any consultation with the people it affects,\u201d Giardini said.</p>    <p>The measure, which is expected to be enacted in November, is among several socially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/31/meps-condemn-italy-move-stop-registering-children-same-sex-parents#:~:text=MEPs%20condemn%20Italy's%20move%20to%20stop%20registering%20children%20of%20same%2Dsex%20parents,-This%20article%20is&amp;text=The%20European%20parliament%20has%20condemned,LGBTQ%2B%20rights%20since%20taking%20power.\">conservative policies</a> pursued by Meloni\u2019s government in its quest to promote traditional family values. However, the law has been ill-thought out, with little clarity on how it will be applied.</p> <p>Meloni, a self-described Christian mother who believes that children should be raised only by heterosexuals, has previously spoken out against surrogacy involving same-sex couples. But while critics argue that the law unfairly targets this cohort, especially gay men, the reality is that nine out of 10 of <a href=\"https://www.corriere.it/politica/23_marzo_23/i-numeri-maternita-surrogata-italia-almeno-250-coppie-l-anno-ma-nove-dieci-sono-eterosessuali-acfa81ac-c8ea-11ed-85b6-6207f76c958d.shtml\">the estimated</a> 250 couples a year who seek surrogacy overseas are straight.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority are heterosexual couples, who for health reasons turn to surrogacy,\u201d said Filomena Gallo, a family lawyer and national secretary of the Luca Coscioni Association, which is campaigning for the decriminalisation of altruistic surrogacy, where women offer to be surrogates without being paid.</p> <p>Giardini had tried through a Rome court to be granted permission to proceed with an altruistic surrogacy after several women volunteered their services. But the request was rejected, and so she and her husband found a surrogate mother abroad. They now have a daughter, aged 14 months.</p> <p>Giardini did not want to share the details of the surrogacy, in order to protect her child, but she has otherwise spoken publicly about her case.</p> <p>It is a lonely battle: most straight couples conceal the fact that they have had a child through surrogacy due to fear of their children being taken away and a deeply entrenched social stigma. Same-sex couples, who are banned from accessing IVF in Italy and from adopting, have, on the other hand, been more vocal in their campaigning as they have no choice but to resort to surrogacy abroad, even if they too live in fear of the potential consequences.</p> <p>Those fears have been amplified now that surrogacy is a universal crime.</p> <p>Gallo said she had received messages from 30 extremely worried couples, 26 of them straight, who had already begun the procedure, some of whose children were about to be born, and who now risk being criminalised.</p> <p>Surrogacy is legal and well regulated in 66 countries, although most Italian couples access the procedure in the US or Canada, where surrogacy is not specified on the birth certificate and where their child can obtain immediate citizenship.</p>    <p>In countries that do not grant citizenship at birth, parents must seek a temporary passport for their baby before returning home, and if the Italian embassy suspects surrogacy then it must report the case to Italy\u2019s public prosecutor\u2019s office. Until now, any reported cases have been shelved because no crime was committed in Italy.</p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of question marks over how this law will be applied,\u201d said Gallo. \u201cItaly can pursue the crime but how will it proceed?

      "bodyText": "Maria Sole Giardini was campaigning outside the Italian parliament in 2021 for surrogacy to be legalised when she encountered Giorgia Meloni. The current prime minister\u2019s Brothers of Italy party, in opposition at the time, was frantically drumming up support for a bill to extend Italy\u2019s outright ban on domestic surrogacy by making it a universal crime that transcends borders. This would have put people like Giardini, who was born without a womb and whose only means of having a baby was to access surrogacy abroad, on a par with terrorists, paedophiles and war criminals. Meloni, who refers to surrogacy using the derogatory term \u201cutero in affitto\u201d (womb for rent), had described it that year as an \u201cabomination\u201d that sought to reduce human life \u201cto a bargaining chip\u201d. Still, she took a moment to speak to Giardini, who is among the estimated 6,000 women in Italy with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome, a condition that affects the female reproductive system. \u201cWhen I explained the condition and asked her \u2018Why won\u2019t you let me become a mother?\u2019, she seemed open to wanting to evaluate surrogacy in certain situations, and we both agreed that women shouldn\u2019t be exploited and that the service should be voluntary,\u201d Giardini said. Last week, almost two years to the day that Meloni\u2019s far-right government came to power, parliament approved the west\u2019s most restrictive law against international surrogacy. Under the terms of the law, which makes surrogacy the universal crime Meloni had campaigned for, couples who go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy risk up to two years in jail and fines of between \u20ac600,000 and \u20ac1m. \u201cThe moment she became prime minister [in 2022] she pushed ahead with this inhumane and wicked law without any consultation with the people it affects,\u201d Giardini said. The measure, which is expected to be enacted in November, is among several socially conservative policies pursued by Meloni\u2019s government in its quest to promote traditional family values. However, the law has been ill-thought out, with little clarity on how it will be applied. Meloni, a self-described Christian mother who believes that children should be raised only by heterosexuals, has previously spoken out against surrogacy involving same-sex couples. But while critics argue that the law unfairly targets this cohort, especially gay men, the reality is that nine out of 10 of the estimated 250 couples a year who seek surrogacy overseas are straight. \u201cThe majority are heterosexual couples, who for health reasons turn to surrogacy,\u201d said Filomena Gallo, a family lawyer and national secretary of the Luca Coscioni Association, which is campaigning for the decriminalisation of altruistic surrogacy, where women offer to be surrogates without being paid. Giardini had tried through a Rome court to be granted permission to proceed with an altruistic surrogacy after several women volunteered their services. But the request was rejected, and so she and her husband found a surrogate mother abroad. They now have a daughter, aged 14 months. Giardini did not want to share the details of the surrogacy, in order to protect her child, but she has otherwise spoken publicly about her case. It is a lonely battle: most straight couples conceal the fact that they have had a child through surrogacy due to fear of their children being taken away and a deeply entrenched social stigma. Same-sex couples, who are banned from accessing IVF in Italy and from adopting, have, on the other hand, been more vocal in their campaigning as they have no choice but to resort to surrogacy abroad, even if they too live in fear of the potential consequences. Those fears have been amplified now that surrogacy is a universal crime. Gallo said she had received messages from 30 extremely worried couples, 26 of them straight, who had already begun the procedure, some of whose children were about to be born, and who now risk being criminalised. Surrogacy is legal and well regulated in 66 countries, although most Italian couples access the procedure in the US or Canada, where surrogacy is not specified on the birth certificate and where their child can obtain immediate citizenship. In countries that do not grant citizenship at birth, parents must seek a temporary passport for their baby before returning home, and if the Italian embassy suspects surrogacy then it must report the case to Italy\u2019s public prosecutor\u2019s office. Until now, any reported cases have been shelved because no crime was committed in Italy. \u201cThere are lots of question marks over how this law will be applied,\u201d said Gallo. \u201cItaly can pursue the crime but how will it proceed? How will couples be identified? Will they carry out investigations? Will there be different processes for heterosexuals and homosexuals? It will be extremely difficult to apply, hence why it seems more like a way to terrify people \u2013 the declarations made so far depict a police state in our country.\u201d Eugenia Roccella, the families minister, provoked fury on Monday after suggesting that doctors should be obliged to report surrogacy violations. In response, Filippo Anelli, president of the Italian order of doctors, said. \u201cOur job is to heal, not to denounce.\u201d Riccardo Magi, president of the leftwing party Pi\u00f9 Europa (More Europe), described the law as \u201ca big operation of propaganda\u201d. \u201cLike a good deal of the bills passed by the Meloni government, it is fragile from a judicial point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cMoreover, we have a superordinate EU norm which clearly states that no citizen can be indicted for an act which is not a crime in the country where it occurred.\u201d Although the law will not apply retroactively, Giardini worries about raising her daughter in a country where she will be considered \u201cthe product of a crime\u201d. \u201cItalians have bigger concerns, such as work and healthcare, and instead of focusing on these issues the government has targeted a small group of people with a law which, more than anything, is spiteful towards children.

He goes to a therapist weekly and refuses to talk about it. He\u2019s in denial, she says. \u201cOf course I\u2019m in denial,\u201d he responds. \u201cCan\u2019t I just enjoy it for now?\u201d Despite the odd moment of clunking exposition, it is a pleasingly sharp script for what is in many ways a horror story, which often does without them. Lynn appears to him in unforgiving visions which suggest deeper secrets between the two of them and around her death than his therapist has any inkling of.</p> <p>Then a strange, silent boy starts turning up at his house late at night \u2013 first making literal scratches at the door, then making his way inside via the dog flap. Is he a former patient or someone he has crossed paths with in his work? Eli\u2019s assistant Cleo (Ava Lalezarzadeh) can find no link between them. Eventually Eli follows the child home to discover that his name is Noah (Jacobi Jupe) and he is living with a foster mother, Denise (Rosie Perez), who can\u2019t get him to speak either. He does, however \u2013 and of course \u2013 draw brilliant, haunting pictures that no one can quite understand. Yet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Eli\u2019s colleague Gail (Sakina Jaffrey) is trying to tempt him out of semi-retirement with a difficult case \u2013 a boy who is nearly out of foster care options due to his behavioural problems and whose next placement threatens to be the state hospital. Guess who?</p> <p>So Eli becomes Noah\u2019s therapist and thereafter all sorts of mysterious connections between them, suffused by the knowledge of Lynn\u2019s death, start to emerge. Eli has a photo of a farmhouse on his fridge that Noah has been drawing repeatedly for months before they met. Eli\u2019s recurring nightmare of diving into an empty swimming pool are mirrored in Noah\u2019s hallucinations of black, awful waters creeping down the walls and forming tentacles that seem to reach out to strangle others.</p>    <p>Traditional horror tropes abound: birds cannon into windows and fall to the ground dead; music begins playing without a human hand (albeit on a laptop instead of record player \u2013 such are the affectless times we live in); Noah speaks in tongues (it turns out to be 17th-century Dutch, and he is pleading to be saved); Eli has a pot-smoking friend (Robert Townsend) who is more open than his super-rationalist pal to the possibilities of past lives and intermingled consciousnesses, and so on. For horror fans, pencils are stuck in necks and baths are filled with rusty water/blood. Bridging the gap we have Noah\u2019s whispered insistence that the pair have met before and that Eli hurt him when they did.</p> <p>Gradually (possibly too gradually \u2013 it\u2019s 10 half-hour episodes and that\u2019s a lot of time to have to fill with ambiguity) the visions and the facts \u2013 and the farmhouse \u2013 coalesce.

      "bodyText": "As someone who has always been faintly unsettled by Billy Crystal \u2013 if I had been Sally faced with the prospect of getting into Harry\u2019s car for a trip from Chicago to New York, I would have said I would rather walk \u2013 it is profoundly relaxing to see him embrace his innately spooky side at last. He plays child psychiatrist Eli Adler, who is mired in grief after the loss of his wife Lynn (Judith Light) to suicide. He goes to a therapist weekly and refuses to talk about it. He\u2019s in denial, she says. \u201cOf course I\u2019m in denial,\u201d he responds. \u201cCan\u2019t I just enjoy it for now?\u201d Despite the odd moment of clunking exposition, it is a pleasingly sharp script for what is in many ways a horror story, which often does without them. Lynn appears to him in unforgiving visions which suggest deeper secrets between the two of them and around her death than his therapist has any inkling of. Then a strange, silent boy starts turning up at his house late at night \u2013 first making literal scratches at the door, then making his way inside via the dog flap. Is he a former patient or someone he has crossed paths with in his work? Eli\u2019s assistant Cleo (Ava Lalezarzadeh) can find no link between them. Eventually Eli follows the child home to discover that his name is Noah (Jacobi Jupe) and he is living with a foster mother, Denise (Rosie Perez), who can\u2019t get him to speak either. He does, however \u2013 and of course \u2013 draw brilliant, haunting pictures that no one can quite understand. Yet. Meanwhile, Eli\u2019s colleague Gail (Sakina Jaffrey) is trying to tempt him out of semi-retirement with a difficult case \u2013 a boy who is nearly out of foster care options due to his behavioural problems and whose next placement threatens to be the state hospital. Guess who? So Eli becomes Noah\u2019s therapist and thereafter all sorts of mysterious connections between them, suffused by the knowledge of Lynn\u2019s death, start to emerge. Eli has a photo of a farmhouse on his fridge that Noah has been drawing repeatedly for months before they met. Eli\u2019s recurring nightmare of diving into an empty swimming pool are mirrored in Noah\u2019s hallucinations of black, awful waters creeping down the walls and forming tentacles that seem to reach out to strangle others. Traditional horror tropes abound: birds cannon into windows and fall to the ground dead; music begins playing without a human hand (albeit on a laptop instead of record player \u2013 such are the affectless times we live in); Noah speaks in tongues (it turns out to be 17th-century Dutch, and he is pleading to be saved); Eli has a pot-smoking friend (Robert Townsend) who is more open than his super-rationalist pal to the possibilities of past lives and intermingled consciousnesses, and so on. For horror fans, pencils are stuck in necks and baths are filled with rusty water/blood. Bridging the gap we have Noah\u2019s whispered insistence that the pair have met before and that Eli hurt him when they did. Gradually (possibly too gradually \u2013 it\u2019s 10 half-hour episodes and that\u2019s a lot of time to have to fill with ambiguity) the visions and the facts \u2013 and the farmhouse \u2013 coalesce. But Before remains more of a mood piece than a full-on ghost or gory horror story. It is at least as interested in the manifestations of guilt in real life as it is using them as fuel for the supernatural narrative, and maintains the grief-stricken atmosphere as well as it does the spine-tingling stuff. And Crystal is brilliant. His commitment to the part and this new mode is total. He never takes refuge in his comedy persona, and he utterly convinces as a man struggling with experiences he never imagined he would have to go through. His pain is both acute and chronic as he learns more about his wife, how he failed her, and how she turned to others to help her process what he could not. What kind of man, what kind of husband, what kind of therapist would allow that are questions that haunt him as deeply as Noah\u2019s visions do him.

      "body": "<p>Like the pangs of romance or the pull of melodrama, adolescent angst proves timeless. Sam Gold, the director of a newly revived Romeo + Juliet on Broadway, knows this \u2013 the production, an admirably diverse, comfortably queer and aggressively zillennial version featuring original music from the pop maestro Jack Antonoff, leans hard into the text\u2019s hot-blooded, definitively teenage impulsivity. But he doesn\u2019t seem to trust it. Romeo + Juliet, so styled after the 1996 Baz Luhrmann film with which it shares an ultra-contemporary, lusty ethos, feels from the jump overeager to assure today\u2019s youths that the stir-crazy teens of Verona were just like them \u2013 stressed, pressed and bursting at the seams with feeling, as told by a Netflix heartthrob (Heartstopper\u2019s Kit Connor) and a Spielberg leading lady (West Side Story\u2019s Rachel Zegler), both in their Broadway debuts.</p> <p>Fresh off his critically acclaimed spin on Henrik Ibsen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/18/an-enemy-of-the-people-review-jeremy-strong-henrik-ibsen-drama\">An Enemy of the People</a> this spring, Gold has returned to the Circle in the Square Theatre, this time energetically styled as a cross between a cutesy arcade (stuffed teddy bears abound) and a Brooklyn rave. As viewers take their seats, the cast, dressed somewhere within the Venn diagram of Bushwick (bustiers, baggy shorts, crop tops) and Netflix high school drama (shark onesie, intense bisexual lighting) rove about the fittingly loose stage \u2014 the round, the stairs, the rafters. (Scenic design by the recently prolific collective dots, costume design by Enver Chakartash.) They grind, grope, vape, caress with the hungry, supple movements of youth, the limb tangles of a basement party.</p> <p>The effect of Shakespeare, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol9CCM240Ag\">bumpin\u2019 that</a>, can be mesmerizing, such as when Gabby Beans, as the actor playing Mercutio, the friar and the prince, introduces the other actors via hand mic and hypebeast-y cheering, all staccato movements and bravado. More often than not, it irks, like an overly enthusiastic theater teacher straining to get equally enthusiastic kids interested in the classics by whatever means necessary, be it overt eroticism, Doc Martens, a couple of mid original pop songs by Antonoff, or the jarring presence of the TikTok binge drinking phenomenon known as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/style/borg-drinking-tiktok.html\">Borg</a> (Blackout Rage Gallon).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsejNojwctQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jsejNojwctQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>In contrast from the overly dour and minimalist rendition starring fellow Brit crush Tom Holland on the West End this summer, Gold\u2019s Romeo + Juliet, like Luhrmann\u2019s, errs on the side of maximalism: glitter, throbbing synth beats, strobe lights, all characters frequently yelling or, at least, always in motion. Some of the decisions feel recklessly, rebelliously unserious, such as a fourth-wall break to sing the former Antonoff band Fun\u2019s We Are Young, by the comic standout G\u00edan P\u00e9rez, who plays Samson, Paris and Peter.</p> <p>The mostly by-the-book production (with text consultations by the Shakespeare scholars Michael Sexton and Ayanna Thompson) strains, and sometimes succeeds, to wring whatever humor and horniness exists in this tale of woe \u2013 the frequent jostling (movement direction by Sonya Tayeh, with violence coordinated by Drew Leary) always toeing the line of erotic (and sometimes giving way to outright titillation); the actors (with the exception of Connor and Zegler) each playing multiple roles, with often murky delineation and a refreshingly modern fluidity of gender. When Connor\u2019s chiseled, dissembling Romeo lunges at Juliet\u2019s balcony (a minimalist, overhanging twin bed), he does a pull-up to kiss her. Cue wolf-whistles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/01/mcneal-robert-downey-jr-play-review\">McNeal review \u2013 Robert Downey Jr shines in muddled AI-themed play</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is all, as one can probably imagine, a lot, at once disarming and confusing. And held together, to the extent that it is, by the remarkable performances of its star-crossed lovers.

      "bodyText": "Like the pangs of romance or the pull of melodrama, adolescent angst proves timeless. Sam Gold, the director of a newly revived Romeo + Juliet on Broadway, knows this \u2013 the production, an admirably diverse, comfortably queer and aggressively zillennial version featuring original music from the pop maestro Jack Antonoff, leans hard into the text\u2019s hot-blooded, definitively teenage impulsivity. But he doesn\u2019t seem to trust it. Romeo + Juliet, so styled after the 1996 Baz Luhrmann film with which it shares an ultra-contemporary, lusty ethos, feels from the jump overeager to assure today\u2019s youths that the stir-crazy teens of Verona were just like them \u2013 stressed, pressed and bursting at the seams with feeling, as told by a Netflix heartthrob (Heartstopper\u2019s Kit Connor) and a Spielberg leading lady (West Side Story\u2019s Rachel Zegler), both in their Broadway debuts. Fresh off his critically acclaimed spin on Henrik Ibsen\u2019s An Enemy of the People this spring, Gold has returned to the Circle in the Square Theatre, this time energetically styled as a cross between a cutesy arcade (stuffed teddy bears abound) and a Brooklyn rave. As viewers take their seats, the cast, dressed somewhere within the Venn diagram of Bushwick (bustiers, baggy shorts, crop tops) and Netflix high school drama (shark onesie, intense bisexual lighting) rove about the fittingly loose stage \u2014 the round, the stairs, the rafters. (Scenic design by the recently prolific collective dots, costume design by Enver Chakartash.) They grind, grope, vape, caress with the hungry, supple movements of youth, the limb tangles of a basement party. The effect of Shakespeare, but bumpin\u2019 that, can be mesmerizing, such as when Gabby Beans, as the actor playing Mercutio, the friar and the prince, introduces the other actors via hand mic and hypebeast-y cheering, all staccato movements and bravado. More often than not, it irks, like an overly enthusiastic theater teacher straining to get equally enthusiastic kids interested in the classics by whatever means necessary, be it overt eroticism, Doc Martens, a couple of mid original pop songs by Antonoff, or the jarring presence of the TikTok binge drinking phenomenon known as a Borg (Blackout Rage Gallon). In contrast from the overly dour and minimalist rendition starring fellow Brit crush Tom Holland on the West End this summer, Gold\u2019s Romeo + Juliet, like Luhrmann\u2019s, errs on the side of maximalism: glitter, throbbing synth beats, strobe lights, all characters frequently yelling or, at least, always in motion. Some of the decisions feel recklessly, rebelliously unserious, such as a fourth-wall break to sing the former Antonoff band Fun\u2019s We Are Young, by the comic standout G\u00edan P\u00e9rez, who plays Samson, Paris and Peter. The mostly by-the-book production (with text consultations by the Shakespeare scholars Michael Sexton and Ayanna Thompson) strains, and sometimes succeeds, to wring whatever humor and horniness exists in this tale of woe \u2013 the frequent jostling (movement direction by Sonya Tayeh, with violence coordinated by Drew Leary) always toeing the line of erotic (and sometimes giving way to outright titillation); the actors (with the exception of Connor and Zegler) each playing multiple roles, with often murky delineation and a refreshingly modern fluidity of gender. When Connor\u2019s chiseled, dissembling Romeo lunges at Juliet\u2019s balcony (a minimalist, overhanging twin bed), he does a pull-up to kiss her. Cue wolf-whistles. It is all, as one can probably imagine, a lot, at once disarming and confusing. And held together, to the extent that it is, by the remarkable performances of its star-crossed lovers. The waifish, doe-like Zegler, who broke through as a deceptively steely ingenue in Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story, stumbles over some iambic pentameter but maintains a lambent, increasingly urgent inner spark, especially as she rebukes her parents (both played with relish by Sola Fadiran). Connor, who excelled at tentative sensitivity in Heartstopper, plays Romeo with amiable laddishness, more soft-hearted, hot-blooded brawn than underdeveloped brain. He is the only cast member who demonstrated a natural grasp on the tricky rhythm of Shakespeare; I palpably relaxed whenever he began to speak, so much better does the dialogue sound from his mouth: intentional, loaded, somewhere never obtuse. For everyone else, the line delivery was spotty: a zinger here, a quip there, and plenty of throwaways to get through performances that were just as much pacing, stomping, strutting and preening and speaking, particularly in the case of Tommy Dorfman\u2019s nurse/Tybalt and Beans\u2019s overdone Mercutio, drawling in a distractingly low, grating octave. Though to be fair, intense over-acting may be for the sake of the crowd, for whom Shakespeare remains a dense and daunting endeavor (\u201cI have soooo much algebra tonight,\u201d said a girl behind me as I exited).

      "bodyText": "King Charles acknowledged \u201cpainful aspects\u201d of Britain\u2019s past while sidestepping calls to directly address reparations for slavery at the summit of Commonwealth leaders, saying \u201cnone of us can change the past, but we can commit \u2026 to learning its lessons\u201d. Charles was speaking to leaders representing 56 Commonwealth nations at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in the Pacific nation of Samoa, his first time attending the summit since taking the throne. In his speech, the king also addressed the climate crisis, development challenges and paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth. Some leaders attending Chogm had hoped that Charles might use his address as an opportunity to issue an apology for Britain\u2019s colonial past, and that this year\u2019s summit would commit to a discussion on the topic of reparatory justice. Charles seemed to acknowledge the concerns of leaders, but did not directly engage with the issue. \u201cI understand from listening to people across the Commonwealth how the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate. It is vital therefore, that we understand our history to guide us to make the right choices in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere inequalities exist \u2026 we must find the right ways and the right language to address them. As we look around the world and consider its many deeply concerning challenges, let us choose within our Commonwealth family, the language of community and respect and reject the language of division.\u201d There have been calls from some African and Caribbean nations for Britain \u2013 and other European powers \u2013 to pay financial compensation for slavery. The Bahamas\u2019 prime minister Philip Davis told AFP that a debate about the past was vital. \u201cThe time has come to have a real dialogue about how we address these historical wrongs,\u201d he said. \u201cReparatory justice is not an easy conversation, but it\u2019s an important one,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe horrors of slavery left a deep, generational wound in our communities, and the fight for justice and reparatory justice is far from over.\u201d On Thursday, British prime minister, Keir Starmer appeared to open the door to non-financial reparations for the UK\u2019s role in the transatlantic enslavement, as he came under pressure from Commonwealth leaders to engage in a \u201cmeaningful, truthful and respectful\u201d conversation about Britain\u2019s past. While Starmer has ruled out paying reparations or apologising for the UK\u2019s role in the transatlantic slave trade, a Downing Street source indicated that the UK could support some forms of reparatory justice, such as restructuring financial institutions and providing debt relief. They also accepted that some reference to reparations was likely to be included in the end-of-summit communique. Responding to Starmer\u2019s decision to discuss \u201cnon-financial\u201d reparations, the St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves \u2013 who was one of the founding leaders of the current reparations committee \u2013 stressed the importance of a reparative justice plan that addressed the enduring psychological and socioeconomic impact of slavery. Arguing that the British had committed genocide against and traumatised both the Indigenous people and enslaved Africans in SVG, he added that while enslavers were compensated with millions at abolition, nothing was given to those who had been enslaved and oppressed. \u201cThere was nothing for them to start with and build on \u2013 no land, no money, no training, no education,\u201d he told the Guardian. This damaging legacy of enslavement and oppression, he added, has continued to plague Caribbean nations. Patricia Scotland, the outgoing secretary-general of the Commonwealth, also nodded to the concerns about colonial legacies in her speech at the summit\u2019s opening, saying: \u201cFor 75 years, we have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to confound the painful history which brought us together and sit together as equals.\u201d Davis said the call for reparations \u201cisn\u2019t simply about financial compensation; it\u2019s about recognising the enduring impact of centuries of exploitation and ensuring that the legacy of slavery is addressed with honesty and integrity.\u201d Joshua Setipa from Lesotho, who is one of three candidates vying to be the next Commonwealth\u2019s secretary-general, said reparations could include non-traditional forms of payment such as climate financing. \u201cWe can find a solution that will begin to address some injustices of the past and put them in the context happening around us today,\u201d he said. In his speech on Friday, Charles also paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth and her commitment to the Commonwealth, which he said \u201chas helped to shape my own life for as long as I can remember.\u201d It also took in development challenges and the climate crisis. \u201cLives, livelihoods and human rights are at risk across the Commonwealth, I can only offer every encouragement for action with unequivocal determination \u2026 If we do not, then inequalities across the Commonwealth and beyond would only be exacerbated with the potential to fuel division and conflict.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Lidia Thorpe\u2019s outburst dominated the headlines this week and while most of the British press saw the dramatic moment an Indigenous senator heckled King Charles in Parliament House as front-page material, not all the local press did. In the UK, the Guardian, Telegraph, Express and the very pro-independence National in Scotland published front-page photographs of Lidia Thorpe shouting: \u201cYou are not our king.\u201d Back home, Murdoch\u2019s The Australian put the confrontation on page one with the headline \u201cA royal pain in the house\u201d. But the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age\u2019s front pages eschewed the dramatic photograph of Thorpe wearing a traditional possum-skin cloak and shaking her fist at Charles, although the Melbourne paper did carry the story. No, it was a sneezing alpaca greeting Charles which graced the front page of the Herald with the headline: \u201cNothing to sneeze at, unless you\u2019re an alpaca.\u201d \u201cThe highlights or lowlights, depending on your point of view, were the sneezing alpaca, who gave his majesty a right royal spray, and Lidia Thorpe, who gave him an even bigger spray\u201d, one Herald reader wrote. The other major breaking royal news was that an Anzac biscuit was referred to as a cookie on a royal menu. For the record, King Charles did not visit the Everest at Royal Randwick on Saturday, despite the Daily Telegraph\u2019s \u201cbig tip\u201d last week about the king\u2019s \u201cRoyal Randwick visit\u201d. Not to matter, apparently he sent a very gracious apology letter for his non-attendance. Gas warfare Speaking of front pages, anti-gas activists in Western Australia were celebrating on Thursday after their campaign slogan \u201cFuck Woodside\u201d made it on to the front page of The Australian. Disrupt Burrup Hub claim Woodside has destroyed thousands of sacred rock art sites as part of the development of a large-scale gas development known as the Burrup Hub. The group was behind the spray-painting of a Woodside Energy logo on to a transparent sheet protecting the Art Gallery of Western Australia\u2019s renowned painting Frederick McCubbin\u2019s Down on his luck. Their wildest dreams came true when The Australian ran a photo of the activist who defaced the logo, artist Joana Partyka, wearing the T-shirt, to illustrate a story about the museum acquiring the graffitied perspex cover for its collection. As part of its merchandise range, the group sells for $35 a cropped white T-shirt with the words \u201cFuck Woodside\u201d printed on the front in tiny print. \u201cPerth society has been left shocked and appalled that the museum has acquired the graffitied perspex glass that protected Frederick McCubbin\u2019s iconic masterpiece \u2018Down on his luck\u2019 from permanent damage when Disrupt Burrup Hub activists sprayed the Woodside logo on it in January last year,\u201d The Australian exclusively reported. No attempt was made to cover the words so we presume no one noticed. Cheque\u2019s in the Mail Daily Mail Australia and the words \u201cpremium content\u201d don\u2019t commonly sit next to each other but a new offering from the Daily Mail is set to change all that. The Daily Mail Australia editor, Felicity Hetherington, says that, driven partially by \u201ca difficult time in the industry\u201d, the company is offering a new subscription service at the end of the month. The new Mail+ is a partial paywall for Australian users who sign up to receive \u201cdaily premium stories\u201d and a \u201cBest of The Mail\u201d weekly newsletter for $1.99 a month. Sign up to get Guardian Australia\u2019s weekly media diary as a free newsletter Hetherington said paywalled stories will be \u201chigh-quality content on subjects that are of the most interest to our readers\u201d. The Daily Mail\u2019s 10 years in Australia have been marked by a business model which relies on ripping off stories from rival media and publishing them alongside as many photographs as possible. Brooks hooked It was UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks who News Corp Australia turned to to deliver a video address from London at this week\u2019s in-house journalism awards. According to a report in The Australian, Brooks presented the award for investigation of the year to The Australian\u2019s media team for coverage of the sexual harassment allegations at Nine Entertainment. One member of the team was former paparazzo Liam Mendes, who claimed he was knocked to the ground at Canberra airport by the former Nine chair Peter Costello. Costello resigned \u201ceffective immediately\u201d, days after the former federal treasurer was accused of assaulting Mendes, who had approached him for comment. Mendes was singled out for praise by Brooks, who said News Corp had \u201cfound a champion with this year\u2019s winner\u201d. The Sunday Telegraph columnist Peta Credlin, who was overlooked for a Kennedy award for the same story, picked up the \u201cbest specialist\u201d News award for her revelations \u201cthat the Uluru statement was longer and had more attachments than pro-voice referendum activists had let on\u201d. Does the award mean Credlin is a fully fledged journalist and can drop the label of Liberal party activist? Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff was exposed by Liberal MP Moira Deeming as a \u201cLiberal party mentor\u201d at Deeming\u2019s defamation trial against John Pesutto. More than 30 pages of texts tendered at the trial show Credlin advising Deeming on how to wrangle the Liberal party and the media. A long way down The Australian was awarded \u201cnews brand of the year\u201d by the publisher of The Australian, News Corp Australia. \u201cEditor-in-chief Michelle Gunn highlighted the energy and excitement the paper\u2019s younger journalists brought to the newsroom,\u201d the Oz reported of its big win. Readers don\u2019t seem to be important when considering the success of a newspaper if the latest Ipsos rankings for the most-read Australian news sites is any indication. For the third consecutive month The Australian was not in the top 20 \u2013 a big fall from 10th in June last year and even its 15th ranking spot in September last year. The ABC News website, which has just been redesigned, re-claimed the top spot, followed closely by Murdoch\u2019s news.com.au. For the record, Guardian Australia occupies the seventh spot ahead of the Age, the Daily Telegraph, the Herald Sun and skynews.com.au. Project marked down ABC technology reporter James Purtill was annoyed when he watched Ten\u2019s The Project after being interviewed for the show\u2019s lead story. Purtill had reported for ABC News that 23andMe, valued at $US6bn in 2021, was on the verge of bankruptcy and The Project was keen to follow up. He had a personal interest in the fate of the company because he had bought a 23andMe DNA kit in 2016 for his San Francisco-based brother. \u201cIts CEO, [Anne] Wojcicki, is considering selling the company, which means the DNA of its 15 million customers would be up for sale, too,\u201d Purtill reported. Purtill said The Project\u2019s story was very similar to his, he was the main talent interviewed and The Project did not mention the original ABC story or the fact that Purtill was a reporter.

      "bodyText": "Israeli strikes hit Beirut on Thursday evening, after the US warned against Israel being led into a \u201cprotracted\u201d campaign in Lebanon and efforts got under way to hold renewed talks over a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. Lebanese state media said several strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on Thursday, about half an hour after Israel issued evacuation warnings for the Hezbollah bastion after intense strikes the night before. In the south of the country, an Israeli strike killed at least three media staff staying at a guesthouse where several other reporters were staying, Lebanese media said. A month into Israel\u2019s military assault on Iranian-backed Hezbollah, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said he hoped Iran was getting a clear message that any further attacks on Israel risked its own interests. Israel has vowed retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on 1 October. Israel unleashed its Lebanon offensive with the declared aim of securing the return of tens of thousands of people evacuated from homes in northern Israel during a year of cross-border hostilities with Hezbollah. \u201cAs Israel conducts operations to remove the threat to Israel and its people along the border with Lebanon, we have been very clear that this cannot lead, should not lead, to a protracted campaign,\u201d Blinken said in Doha on his 11th trip to the region in the last year. Blinken said the US was working on a diplomatic deal which would allow civilians on both sides on the border to return to their homes. Later, the head of Israel\u2019s military said an end to the conflict with Hezbollah now looked possible. \u201cIn the north [of Israel], there\u2019s a possibility of reaching a sharp conclusion. We thoroughly dismantled Hezbollah\u2019s senior chain of command,\u201d Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said in a video statement. Blinken is set to meet with Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati in London on Friday, as well as with the foreign ministers of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, two key US partners in a postwar plan for Gaza, the state department said. US and Israeli negotiators will gather in Doha to prepare for renewed talks on a Gaza ceasefire deal which would also entail release of hostages in the Palestinian territory, Qatar and Washington said on Thursday. Israel said its Mossad intelligence agency head David Barnea will travel to Doha on Sunday to try to restart talks, and meet with CIA director William Burns and Qatar\u2019s prime minister. \u201cThe parties will discuss the various options for starting negotiations for the release of the hostages from Hamas captivity, against the backdrop of the latest developments,\u201d the office of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Hamas senior official Osama Hamdan told pro-Iranian channel Al Mayadeen there was no change in the group\u2019s position. \u201cThe hostages held by the resistance will only return by stopping the aggression and completely withdrawing,\u201d Hamdan said. Previous attempts to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal have failed. Blinken, who held talks with Qatar\u2019s prime minister, has been on his first trip to the region since Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the group\u2019s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered conflict across the Middle East. Washington, Israel\u2019s close ally, has expressed hope his death can provide an impetus for an end to the fighting. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse",

Mancini, who won the European Championship as Italy coach in 2021, has left his post by \u201cjoint agreement\u201d, the Saudi Arabian Football Federation said. The 59-year-old was hired by Saudi Arabia in August 2023 \u2013 two weeks after he resigned as Italy manager \u2013 and led the side to seven wins in 18 matches during an underwhelming 14-month reign. Saudi Arabia sit outside the automatic qualification spots for the 2026 World Cup after a 2-0 defeat to Japan at home was followed by a goalless draw with Bahrain earlier this month. The Saudis are third in Group C of Asia\u2019s third round of World Cup qualifiers with five points after four matches. Japan lead the group with 10 points while Australia are ahead of Saudi Arabia on goal difference. The top two in each group advance automatically to the World Cup while the third and fourth-placed sides go into another round of qualifiers with the bottom two finishers eliminated. Australia will host Saudi Arabia in a World Cup qualifier in Melbourne on 14 November, with the Saudis then facing Indonesia in Jakarta five days later. Under Mancini, the Saudis were knocked out of the Asian Cup in the last 16 earlier this year after losing in a penalty shootout to South Korea. The Italian came under fire for walking down the tunnel before South Korea had taken their final penalty and later apologised for his early exit. \u201cThe board of directors of the Saudi Football Federation and the coach of the national team, Roberto Mancini, reached a joint agreement today, which includes the end of the contractual relationship,\u201d the SAFF posted on social media platform X. The former Internazionale and Manchester City manager has won multiple titles in a decorated career as both player and coach. As manager of Inter, Mancini won three Italian league titles and went on to win the Premier League with Manchester City in 2012 thanks to Sergio Aguero\u2019s dramatic late goal on the final day of the season.",

Over the course of the evening, speakers repeatedly criticized Donald Trump for comments made by past members of his administration who said Trump fits the definition of fascist. </p></li> \n   <li><p>The family of <strong>Amber Nicole Thurman, </strong>a Black 28-year-old mother who died just weeks after Georgia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion\">abortion</a> ban went into effect, was in attendance at the rally. Tomorrow, Harris is expected to make another high profile appearance, this time alongside <strong>Beyonc\u00e9</strong> in Houston, where the vice-president hopes to rally support for Senate candidate <strong>Colin Allred</strong>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump </strong>rallied supporters in Tempe, Arizona, today, where he spoke alongside Senate candidate <strong>Kari Lake</strong>. Earlier in the day, Trump made news when he vowed that, if elected, he would immediately fire <strong>Jack Smith</strong>, the justice department special counsel who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Phoenix police</strong> arrested a man suspected of setting fire to a mailbox there, damaging mail-in ballots.<strong> </strong>The news comes just days after Tempe police arrested another man in connection with three shootings at Democratic party campaign offices in Tempe. An Arizona prosecutor said the second man had more than 120 guns and more than 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home, leading law enforcement to believe he may have been planning a mass casualty event.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Harris</strong> picked up the endorsement of two Republicans, one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/24/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-politics-democrats-republicans?page=with:block-671a43a28f08791c139f6a05#block-671a43a28f08791c139f6a05\">a former congressman from Michigan</a>, the other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/24/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-politics-democrats-republicans?page=with:block-671a48368f08e8a9846d1797#block-671a48368f08e8a9846d1797\">a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin</a>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Joe Biden </strong>announced he will issue an apology tomorrow for the US government\u2019s role in forcing thousands of Indigenous American children to attend Indian boarding schools \u2013 a policy which has been widely recognized as an element of genocide. The news comes as Harris is trailing in the polls in Arizona, a state that Biden famously won in 2020, largely due to the support of Indigenous American voters.</p></li> \n   <li><p>More than 29 million people have voted already in the 2024 election, at least partly driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> embracing early voting at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump\u2019s</a> direction.

      "bodyText": "Closing Summary This blog is closing now, thanks for following along. You can read our US elections coverage here. Here are the major developments from today: Barack Obama campaigned alongside Kamala Harris at a star-studded rally in Atlanta today. The ex-president and vice-president were joined on stage by Samuel L Jackson, Spike Lee, senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossof, Bruce Springsteen and Tyler Perry. Over the course of the evening, speakers repeatedly criticized Donald Trump for comments made by past members of his administration who said Trump fits the definition of fascist. The family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black 28-year-old mother who died just weeks after Georgia\u2019s abortion ban went into effect, was in attendance at the rally. Tomorrow, Harris is expected to make another high profile appearance, this time alongside Beyonc\u00e9 in Houston, where the vice-president hopes to rally support for Senate candidate Colin Allred. Donald Trump rallied supporters in Tempe, Arizona, today, where he spoke alongside Senate candidate Kari Lake. Earlier in the day, Trump made news when he vowed that, if elected, he would immediately fire Jack Smith, the justice department special counsel who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents. Phoenix police arrested a man suspected of setting fire to a mailbox there, damaging mail-in ballots. The news comes just days after Tempe police arrested another man in connection with three shootings at Democratic party campaign offices in Tempe. An Arizona prosecutor said the second man had more than 120 guns and more than 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home, leading law enforcement to believe he may have been planning a mass casualty event. Harris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans, one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. Joe Biden announced he will issue an apology tomorrow for the US government\u2019s role in forcing thousands of Indigenous American children to attend Indian boarding schools \u2013 a policy which has been widely recognized as an element of genocide. The news comes as Harris is trailing in the polls in Arizona, a state that Biden famously won in 2020, largely due to the support of Indigenous American voters. More than 29 million people have voted already in the 2024 election, at least partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Donald Trump\u2019s direction. So far, Republicans have cast 32% of ballots, up from 27% at this point in 2020. Whereas Democrats have cast 42% of the votes, down from 47% at this point in the last presidential election. JD Vance, who is currently speaking with Chris Cuomo on News Nation, called John Kelly a \u201cdisgrunted ex-employee\u201d at a campaign event in Waterford, Michigan earlier today. \u201cJohn Kelly was fired by Donald Trump, and he\u2019s pissed off about it and won\u2019t stop talking about it,\u201d Vance said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got three or four people who were allegedly in the room when it happened saying he\u2019s making it up. Even Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff said that John Kelly is making up a bunch of crap about Donald J. Trump.\u201d Kamala Harris has concluded her rally in Atlanta by evoking the legacy of the late Congressman John Lewis. \u201cAs the great Congressman John Lewis reminded us, Democracy is not a state, it is an act,\u201d Harris said. Georgia senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who spoke earlier in the evening, were close confidants of Lewis. Warnock was Lewis\u2019 pastor and Ossoff served as an intern in Lewis\u2019 office early in his career. Lewis, who represented Georgia in the House, was a civil rights leader most famous for organizing the March on Washington. The family of Amber Nicole Thurman is in attendance at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Atlanta. Thurman, a Black 28-year-old mother to a young son, died just weeks after Georgia\u2019s abortion ban went into effect. Thurman\u2019s death was only recently identified as a result of the state\u2019s abortion ban in September when ProPublica published an investigation into her death. For more on Thurman\u2019s death: Kamala Harris has praised ex-president Barack Obama throughout her speech in Atlanta, tapping into their close friendship and the Obamas\u2019 casting of Harris as their political heir. Early in her speech, Harris led the crowd in a chant of \u201cYes we can,\u201d evoking Obama\u2019s own campaign for presidency. Later, she began a chant of \u201cWe\u2019re not going back.\u201d She also noted the ex-president\u2019s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. \u201cDonald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act, or like we like to call it Obamacare,\u201d she said. At a campaign event in North Carolina today, Tim Walz praised former vice-president Dick Cheney for endorsing Kamala Harris \u2013 while also acknowledging his own past criticism of Cheney. \u201cTrust me on this. I have expressed my opinions over the years very strongly toward former vice-president Cheney on where I felt. But when the time came to protect the constitution, he\u2019s making the right decision,\u201d Walz said. \u201cAnd I have no illusion on this. Dick Cheney is protecting the Constitution, but the minute he gets to vote for a true Republican, he will vote for a true Republican. And we will welcome that. The minute that they do that \u2013 he will do that, and he will not vote for me \u2013 and I understand that.\u201d Kamala Harris is now speaking at her rally in Atlanta. The vice-president was introduced by Barack Obama. Harris has begun her remarks by recalling her early friendship with Obama. \u201cIt was over 17 years ago when I took a trip to Springfield. It was a cold February day, and I went there to support this brilliant young senator who was running for president of the United States,\u201d she said. Harris also thanked Samuel L Jackson, Spike Lee, Tyler Perry and \u201cthe great American poet Bruce Springsteen\u201d before launching into a familiar version of her stump speech. Barack Obama has reiterated many of the points he has made in previous stump speeches for Kamala Harris \u2013 including denouncing Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and economy \u2013 while also criticizing the ex-president\u2019s comments following Hurricane Helene. \u201cDonald Trump lies about about hurricane aid,\u201d Obama said, adding that Trump \u201cdeliberately circulate[d] rumors that that money is being given to illegal aliens, illegal immigrants, as opposed to people who are desperate\u201d. New filings with the Federal Election Commission show that Elon Musk gave $10m to campaigns for Senate Republicans in October. Musk has donated millions to political action committees working to elect Republican candidates this election cycle, including about $75m to his pro-Trump America Pac. This latest filing shows that Musk donated $10m to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super Pac working to flip the Senate to Republican control. The fund has spent at least $210m supporting Repubican candidates for Senate this year. Barack Obama has referenced John Kelly\u2019s comments about Donald Trump\u2019s authoritarian tendencies. \u201cThe other day, General John Kelly, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, said that Trump told him he wanted his generals be like Hitler\u2019s generals,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIn politics, a good rule of thumb is don\u2019t say you want to do anything like Hitler. \u201cThese are serious people,\u201d Obama added, speaking of Kelly and Mark Meadows, who both served as Trump\u2019s chiefs of staff. \u201cThey are not, quote, unquote, woke liberals. They are people who have never in the past even talked about politics, because they believe that the military should be above politics. But the reason they\u2019re speaking up is because they have seen that in Donald Trump\u2019s mind, the military does not exist to serve the constitution or the American people. He doesn\u2019t see being commander in chief as a solemn, sacred responsibility, just like everything else. He thinks the military exists to do his bidding, to serve his interests.\u201d Barack Obama is now speaking at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Atlanta. The ex-president acknowledged the line-up of celebrity guests that preceded him and then encouraged the crowd to go vote, before giving a version of the stump speech he has given at other Harris campaign events. \u201cNow we know this election is going to be tight because a lot of Americans are still struggling,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo I get why people are looking to shake things up. What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you.\u201d Speaking at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Atlanta, actor Tyler Perry has denounced Donald Trump and says that today he voted for Harris. \u201cI watched [Trump] from the Central Park Five to Project 2025. What I realized is in this Donald Trump\u2019s America, there is no dream that looks like me. We want a president who believes the American dream is for everyone. That president is Kamala Harris,\u201d Perry said. Noting the close margin of votes in Georgia\u2019s 2020 presidential election, Perry added: \u201cEvery vote counts.\u201d A star-studded line-up of politicians and celebrities have rallied attendees of Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, this evening. Harris and Barack Obama are expected to speak at 7.30 ET. Ahead of them, actor Samuel L Jackson, director Spike Lee, senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossof, and actor Tyler Perry have spoken to voters. \u201cLet me say that I do not believe that significant numbers of Black men are going to vote for the likes of Donald Trump,\u201d Warnock said, referencing data that has shown young Black men are increasingly leaning toward the ex-president. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. Now, we are not a monolith. There will be some. But there won\u2019t be this wave. After all, we know who Donald Trump is.\u201d Earlier, Bruce Springsteen \u2013 who has endorsed Harris - performed Land of Hope and Dreams and Dancing in the Dark. The musician warned the audience that Trump was running to become \u201can American tyrant\u201d. Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren \u2013 whose grandmother was taken to an Indian boarding school in Riverside, California \u2013 has released a statement thanking President Joe Biden for his expected apology for the US government\u2019s role in the boarding school system. \u201cFor generations, Native children, including many from the Navajo Nation, were subjected to an education system that sought to erase our languages, cultures and identities,\u201d Nygren said. \u201cBy recognizing this tragic legacy, President Biden honors the resilience of the survivors and their families, many of whom carry the weight of these experiences. He sends a message that healing and truth are central to building a just future. The Navajo Nation stands ready to work with his administration, as well as the next administration, to continue uncovering the truth, honoring those who were lost, and ensuring that these atrocities are never repeated.\u201d More than 29 million people have voted already in the 2024 election, CNN reports, as Donald Trump calls for his supporters to vote ahead of election day. So far, Republicans have cast 32 percent of ballots, up from 27 percent at this point in 2020. Whereas Democrats have cast 42 percent of the votes, down from 47 percent at this point in the last presidential election. In recent weeks, Trump and his supporters have increasingly called for Republicans to vote early \u2013 a strategy Republicans have not typically embraced. JD Vance published an essay in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette today calling Kamala Harris \u201canti-Catholic\u201d. The news comes just a day after Donald Trump attended a campaign event at a church in Zebulon, Georgia yesterday, where he claimed Catholics are \u201cthreated worse than anybody.\u201d Later, at a CNN town hall yesterday evening, Harris spoke openly about her Christian faith, noting that she prays every day. In the Post-Gazette essay, Vance argues that Harris and other Democrats have \u201cmocked\u201d Catholics and that her support of progressive policies \u2013 like same-sex marriage and gender-affirming healthcare \u2013 is anti-Catholic. Kamala Harris is polling slightly ahead of Donald Trump in the swing state of Michigan, according to recently released survey results from Michigan State University. As of 17 October, our polling showed Trump leading the state by a narrow one-point margin. According to Michigan State University, Harris is leading Trump at 52 percent to 48 percent among likely voters. Michigan, which holds 16 electoral votes, voted for Joe Biden in 2020 \u2013 but the state is hotly contested this year, in part as the state\u2019s large Arab American community grapples with which candidate to support following the war in Gaza. Actor Samuel L Jackson and director Spike Lee \u2013 two graduates of Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse college \u2013 spoke to a crowd of thousands at a stadium in Clarkston, Georgia ahead of the appearance of vice-president Kamala Harris and former president Barack Obama. \u201cDo not wait until election day to show your support,\u201d Jackson said, exhorting voters to go to the polls early. \u201cShowing up at the polls is the only way.\u201d Early voting totals have been breaking records in Georgia, with about 30% of the electorate having already cast a ballot. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard her favorite curse word is a favorite of mine too,\u201d Jackson said, pointedly avoiding the use of the actual offensive term he is famous for. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of president I can stand behind.\u201d Spike Lee reminded people that he is a \u201cGrady baby\u201d, born at Atlanta\u2019s Grady Memorial hospital and three generations deep in the city. \u201cPower is knowing your past,\u201d he said. \u201cGeorgia is where the future is being written. Georgia is showing up and showing out, no matter what kind of shenanigans, skullduggery and subterfuge.\u201d Referring to Donald Trump as \u201cagent orange\u201d, Lee said that \u201ctoday, we cannot be hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray\u201d. Opening his rally in Tempe, Arizona, Donald Trump said he watched Kamala Harris\u2019 town hall on CNN last night and called her performance \u201cpathetic\u201d. Later, he denounced reporters in the building for focusing their cameras on his face and not the charts he shows at his rallies. His comments that journalists are \u201cbad people\u201d and \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d spurred a chorus of chants from his supporters, who booed the reporters in the building. In the final days of the 2024 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris is gearing up for another podcast interview, this time with former NFL player Shannon Sharpe for his show Club Shay Shay. The interview, which will tape in Atlanta, will air on Monday, 28 October. Harris has embraced podcast interviews in the final weeks of the election, with appearances on Call Her Daddy and All The Smoke. Guardian reporter Jesse Hassenger has more on Harris\u2019 and Trump\u2019s podcast appearances: Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Tempe, Arizona, is starting late. Meanwhile, his running mate JD Vance is expected to take the stage shortly at a separate event in Waterford, Michigan. We\u2019ll alert you of any developments as the events get underway. Trump is expected to hold another rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, this evening after Kamala Harris campaigns alongside ex-president Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen in Atlanta this afternoon. In a rare post on X, Donald Trump is denouncing his former chief of staff John Kelly, who recently made news for saying Trump meets the definition of a fascist. In the post, Trump calls Kelly a \u201cbad general\u201d, an apparent reference to a separate interview Kelly gave the Atlantic where he described Trump lamenting that he did not have generals who were loyal in the way he believed German military commanders had been to Hitler. Robert Tait has more on Kelly\u2019s comments about Trump\u2019s authoritarian leanings: As Joe Biden travels to Arizona and Donald Trump prepares to take the stage at two rallies there today, Phoenix police have arrested a man suspected of setting fire to a mailbox there where mail-in ballots were damaged this morning. The news comes just days after Tempe police arrested a separate man in connection with three shootings at Democratic party campaign offices in Tempe. The Arizona Republic reports that Phoenix police arrested Dieter Klofkorn, who told investigators he lit the fire because he wanted to be arrested, this morning. Before firefighters could extinguish the fire, the New York Times reports, approximately 20 ballots were damaged. Arizona secretary of state Adrian Fontes told the paper that voters whose ballots were damaged will receive a new ballot. Donald Trump will be taking the stage at his rally in Tempe, Arizona, shortly, where he is expected to return to the issue that has defined his campaign: immigration. According to his prepared remarks, Trump will argue that Kamala Harris\u2019s handling of the border should disqualify her from the presidency. Trump will be joined on stage by Kari Lake, a former television news anchor and dedicated follower of Trump\u2019s who is running for the state\u2019s open Senate seat. Ahead of her appearance in Tempe, Lake told the Associated Press that she would use the CBP One app, which allows migrants to request asylum at the south-west border, to deport people if elected. \u201cThat app works both ways,\u201d Lake said. \u201cIn January 2025, we\u2019re gonna control that app and we\u2019re gonna find the people who invaded our country and we\u2019re going to send them home.\u201d Hilary Clinton will appear on CNN this evening in an interview with Kaitlan Collins, host of The Source. The interview comes just a day after the network aired its town hall with Kamala Harris, an event that Donald Trump declined to attend. Joe Biden will travel to Arizona today and is expected to formally apologize tomorrow for the US government\u2019s role in forcing thousands of Native American children to attend Indian boarding schools \u2013 a policy which has been widely recognized as an element of genocide. The news comes as Kamala Harris is trailing in the polls in Arizona, a state that Biden famously won in 2020, largely due to the support of Native American voters. \u201cI would never have guessed in a million years that something like this would happen,\u201d the secretary of interior, Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, told the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal to me. I\u2019m sure it will be a big deal to all of Indian Country.\u201d As the first Native American to lead the Department of the Interior, Haaland launched an investigation into the boarding school system, which found that at least 18,000 children were removed from their parents and forced to attend the schools, which sought to assimilate them into white American culture. The investigation documented about 1,000 deaths of children that occurred at the boarding schools. On Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, the Democratic National Committee announced that it had launched a \u201csix-figure ad campaign\u201d aimed at turning out Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska. It is the party\u2019s third Native-focused campaign this year, and \u201cthe most the DNC has ever spent on a campaign targeting Native voters\u201d. Phoenix mayor Kate Gallego has announced the arrest of a suspect involved in setting a fire at a USPS mailbox that damaged a small number of mail-in ballots: Phoenix is the largest city in swing state Arizona, and many residents are returning ballots by mail. Here\u2019s more of what we know about the incident: Things aren\u2019t looking terrible everywhere for Democrats. The party grew nervous earlier this year in Maryland when Republican former governor Larry Hogan jumped into the race for the open Senate seat in what is typically a Democratic bastion. Maryland voters had twice elected Hogan to the governor\u2019s mansion, and he is viewed as perhaps the only Republican in the state with a shot at winning the Senate seat. But a poll from the Washington Post and the University of Maryland released today shows the Democratic nominee, Prince George\u2019s county executive Angela Alsobrooks, with a commanding lead of 52% among likely voters, and Hogan at a mere 40%. That\u2019s sure to quell some jitters in the party, though winning the seat, which is currently occupied by Democrat Ben Cardin, is not enough to get the party the majority in the chamber. Democratic senator Jon Tester\u2019s bid for re-election in Montana is a mirror of the party\u2019s wider struggles to maintain the support of voters in rural areas across the country, which have grown increasingly Republican in recent years, threatening the party\u2019s ability to win races up and down the ballot. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith traveled to Big Sky Country to see if Tester\u2019s circumstances are as dire as they appear from afar: He was a young and little-known underdog. So Max Baucus, candidate for Congress, decided to trek 630 miles across Montana and listen to people talk about their problems. \u201cAs luck would have it, on the first day, I walked into a blizzard,\u201d he recalls, pointing to a photo of his young self caked in snow. \u201cIt was cold! But the blizzard didn\u2019t last that long.\u201d Baucus shed 12lb during that two-and-a-half month journey in 1974. He also made friends. The Democrat defeated a Republican incumbent and would soon go on to serve as a Montana senator for 36 years. He never lost an election but saw his beloved home state undergo many changes. Among them is the prospect that Democrats like him are now facing political extinction. Jon Tester, a moderate Democrat who is one of Montana\u2019s current senators, is fighting for his political life in the 5 November election. Opinion polls suggest that he is trailing his Republican rival, Tim Sheehy. Control of the closely divided Senate, and the ability to enable or stymie the ambitions of a President Kamala Harris or President Donald Trump, could hinge on the outcome. The Senate race in Montana is widely seen as a litmus test of whether Democrats can still win in largely rural states that have embraced Trump\u2019s Republican party. It is also a study in whether the type of hyperlocal campaigning that Baucus practised half a century ago can outpace shifts in demographics, media and spending that have rendered all politics national. Democrats are fighting to keep their majority in the Senate, and evidence continues to mount that Jon Tester, the Montana senator whose re-election is viewed as essential to doing that, is struggling. The party has already conceded a seat in deep-red West Virginia, but is hoping Kamala Harris\u2019s victory combined with those of Tester and Sherrod Brown in Ohio, along with several other incumbents, will renew its majority. Polls have lately shown Tester trailing his Republican opponent, and the political advertising trackers at Medium Buying report a Republican group has cancelled television ads in Montana \u2013 a sign the party views the seat as theirs for the taking: Here\u2019s more on the calculations behind the quest for control of Congress\u2019s upper chamber: Harris then took a few questions from the press, but didn\u2019t make news. Asked for more details of the Philadelphia concert scheduled for Monday where Bruce Springsteen will perform and Barack Obama will speak in support of her candidacy, Harris demurred. \u201cI have nothing to report at this moment. Stay tuned,\u201d the vice-president said, after noting that Springsteen was \u201can American icon\u201d. She dodged a question about whether she would allow construction of a wall on the border with Mexico, and how she would vote on a California ballot proposition to heighten penalties for shoplifters and drug dealers. Harris did share some thoughts on the gender divide pollsters say they are observing ahead of the election, with women breaking for Democrats and men for Republicans by increasingly wide margins: It\u2019s not what I see, in terms of my rallies, in terms of interactions I\u2019m having with people in communities and on the ground. What I\u2019m seeing is, in equal measure, men and women talking about their concerns about the future of our democracy, talking about the fact that they want a president who leads with optimism and takes on the challenges that we face, whether it be grocery prices or investing in small businesses or home ownership. In brief remarks to the press in Philadelphia before departing for a campaign event in Georgia, Kamala Harris thanked the two Republican politicians who announced they would be voting for her. Former congressman Fred Upton of Michigan and Waukesha, Wisconsin mayor Shawn Reilly both cited their concerns with Donald Trump in announcing their endorsement of Harris. \u201cThis continues to be, I think, evidence of the fact that people who have been leaders in our country, regardless of their political party, understand what\u2019s at stake. And they are weighing in courageously, in many cases, in support of what we need to have, which is a president of the United States who understands the obligation to uphold the constitution of the United States and our democracy,\u201d Harris said. She also hit out at Donald Trump, who declined to participate in a second debate with Harris hosted by CNN that would have happened last night. Instead, the vice-president to appeared solo at a town hall the network organized with undecided voters in Philadelphia. Here\u2019s what Harris said: As for last night, yet again, Trump not showing up, refused to be a part of a CNN debate, and clearly his staff has been saying he\u2019s exhausted. And the sad part about that is, he\u2019s trying to be president of the United States, probably the toughest job in the world, and he\u2019s exhausted. I said last night what I mean, which is the American people are being presented with a very serious decision, and it includes what we must understand will happen starting on January 20, in this choice. Either you have the choice of a Donald Trump will sit in the Oval Office stewing, plotting revenge, retribution, writing out his enemies list, or what I will be doing, which is responding to folks like the folks last night with a to-do list, understanding the need to work on lifting up the American people, whether it be through the issue of grocery prices and bringing them down, or investing in our economy, investing in our small businesses, investing in our families. Voto Latino, a top civic engagement non-profit aimed at empowering Latino voters, has launched a new campaign to raise awareness about what Project 2025 means for Latinos. The organization identified parts of Project 2025 that would have the most negative effect on the Latino community, and translated these portions into Spanish. Voto Latino is launching paid ads in Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Michigan to publicize this initiative, in a $3.5m campaign. Remember: Trump has tried to distance himself from the Heritage Foundation-backed initiative to overhaul the US government, which includes plans to outlaw abortion and fire civil servants en masse, as polling indicated it was a political liability for him. The Vera Institute for Justice said that provisions relating to immigration were \u201cdesigned to initiate mass deportations.\u201d \u201cAs much as former President Trump tries to distance himself from Project 2025, we will not be fooled: We know that he will implement this extremist agenda if he wins. It is clear that Project 2025 will set us back by dismantling the fabric of our country through extreme conservative efforts to impose a regressive vision for our nation,\u201d Maria Teresa Kumar, Voto Latino President and Co-Founder, said in a press release announcing the campaign. \u201cThe threats posed to our community by Project 2025 are clear and present. Latino voters and other voters of color will be affected the most by Project 2025.\u201d \u201cWe have the power to ensure that an extremist agenda does not go into place by making our voices heard at the ballot box in November,\u201d Kumar also said. \u201cIn this election, over 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote. We have a responsibility to inform one another of the potential dangers related to Trump\u2019s agenda as seen in Project 2025, and the impact that it will have on ourselves, our communities, and our families.\u201d Donald Trump has been working tirelessly to win over male voters and by some measures, his efforts appear effective. Trump is besting Kamala Harris among men 53 to 37 percent, according to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll, while the vice president is winning women 53 percent to his 36 percent. Trump\u2019s far-right politics seem especially appealing to white male voters, and there have been various explanations for this trend. Some have opined that it\u2019s sheer sexism; others believe that it\u2019s due to a purported male loneliness epidemic and uncertainty about their role in American society. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland and Tom Silverstone spoke with residents of Middletown, Ohio--GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance\u2019s hometown-- in an effort to learn why gender is a watershed issue in this election. Here is their eye-opening report. With less than two weeks to go before election day, data indicates that early voting has hit massive numbers in several key swing states. Some 25 million Americans have already cast their ballots. At least part of this surge was prompted by Republicans deciding to vote early due to Donald Trump\u2019s direction. In the battleground state of Georgia, which Trump lost by just 11,779 votes in 2020, more than 1.9 million Americans have either cast their votes via mail-in ballots or in person. North Carolina saw 1.7 million voting early in spite of the disastrous Hurricane Helene in September. While Trump has emphatically urged his supporters to hit the polls, saying at a Georgia rally \u201cjust vote \u2013 whichever way you want to do it,\u201d Democrats and progressives are also encouraging early voting. Senate Democrats on Tuesday released a report urging Americans to vote as early as possible, and to answer questions about why the results might not be known on election night. On college campuses, advocates are working to increase early voting access for students. At the University of Minnesota on Tuesday, for example, the undergraduate student government organized a one-day pop-up polling site. Donald Trump made clear that he would end the effort to hold him legally accountable for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents, saying in an interview that he would fire special counsel Jack Smith \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d, if elected. The comment drew an uproar from Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign, which is seeking to convince voters that Trump would govern as a dictator in a second term. Meanwhile, the vice-president is gearing up for her rally in Houston tomorrow, where she will reportedly be joined by Beyonc\u00e9. We will see her later today in Georgia at a campaign event scheduled for 7pm, while Trump holds a rally in Arizona at 4pm. Here\u2019s what else has been going on today: Harris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans, one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. Yet another former Trump administration official has reportedly warned of his dictatorial streak, specifically his \u201cauthoritarian tendencies\u201d. A thorough poll from Bloomberg News and Morning Consult finds the same thing many before it has: the race is too close to call. Later on in Donald Trump\u2019s interview with conservative broadcaster Hugh Hewitt, the former president attacked special counsel Jack Smith as \u201ca scoundrel\u201d, and says he does not think he would be impeached for firing him. \u201cNow, they will impeach you again on day one if you fire Jack Smith or you pardon yourself. Are you prepared to be impeached again and again and again if they have the House, because they just will?\u201d Hewitt asked, referring to the Democrats who could recapture that majority in Congress\u2019s lower chamber in the upcoming election. Trump responded: No, I don\u2019t think they will impeach me if I fire Jack Smith. Jack Smith is a scoundrel, he\u2019s a very dishonest man in my opinion, very dishonest man, and he\u2019s a mean man, a mean man, but his problem is he\u2019s so mean that he always goes too far, like the raid of Mar-a-Lago. The latter part is a reference to the second case Smith brought against Trump, for allegedly hiding classified materials at his properties, including Mar-a-Lago in south Florida. Over the summer, Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed federal judge who was assigned to the case, threw out Smith\u2019s indictment, which the special counsel is appealing. In his interview with Hewitt, Trump said, \u201cWe had a brave, brilliant judge in Florida\u201d, apparently a reference to Cannon. ABC News reports that his feelings go deeper than that: Cannon\u2019s name is on a list of potential attorney general candidates for his second administration, and was added after she dismissed the classified documents indictment. Special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s case against Donald Trump for allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 election was delayed for months as the supreme court dealt with the former president\u2019s claim of immunity, and is only now getting back on track. As the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reported earlier this month, Smith\u2019s team appears to want to center its case on how Trump\u2019s vice-president Mike Pence handled the then-president\u2019s effort to keep Joe Biden out of the White House. Here\u2019s more: Special counsel prosecutors intend to make Donald Trump\u2019s vice-president Mike Pence and efforts to recruit fake Trump electors the centerpiece of the criminal prosecution against the former president, according to a sprawling legal brief that was partly unsealed on Wednesday. The redacted brief, made public by the presiding US district judge Tanya Chutkan, shows prosecutors are relying extensively on Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Pence to support the charge that Trump conspired to obstruct the January 6 certification of the election results. And prosecutors used an equally voluminous portion of the 165-page brief to express their intent to use evidence of Trump trying to get officials in seven key swing states to reverse his defeat to support the charges that he conspired to disenfranchise American voters. The brief\u2019s principal mission was to convince Chutkan to allow the allegations and evidence buttressing the superseding indictment against Trump to proceed to trial, arguing that it complied with the US supreme court\u2019s recent ruling that gave former presidents immunity for official acts. As part of the ruling, the court ordered Chutkan to sort through the indictment and decide which of the allegations against Trump should be tossed because of the immunity rules and which could proceed to trial. Democrats have been loudly condemning Donald Trump for rhetoric they call dictatorial, as well as steering voters\u2019 attention to his former White House chief of staff John Kelly\u2019s comment that he meets the definition of a fascist. In an interview with the New Republic, Ben Wikler, who as chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party is hoping to deliver the electoral votes of one of the swingiest swing states to Kamala Harris, explains why he believes such allegations may tip the scales in the vice-president\u2019s favor: This is critical because this is the genuine article that stakes in this election. Now we\u2019ve got Mark Milley, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Kelly, former President Trump\u2019s chief of staff, who was a four-star general\u2014and Harris amplifying it\u2014making clear that the nation\u2019s cameras are pointed directly at this reality. For the voters that are on the fence, who often feel deeply conflicted in the final weeks of this election, people who maybe have voted Republican in the past, but are not quite sure if they can vote for Trump again, this gives them a very clear reason to break against Trump. And that could be the entire ball game. Wisconsin is a jump ball right now. There\u2019s a poll today that finds 2 percent of Wisconsin, or 4 percent of Wisconsin voters, undecided, and 48-48 for Harris and for Trump. That means that the decisions made by those last 4 percent could tip the entire election here and probably, frankly, in all the other battleground states. There\u2019s seven states that are jump balls in the final stretch. And what we know\u2014I know this from directly knocking on doors and talking to voters; we know this from polls; we know this from models; we know this from focus groups; we know from every method of research that we have\u2014is that there\u2019s a share of the undecided electorate who have been traditionally Republican, who can\u2019t stand the idea of Trump and are trying to decide for themselves whether they can overcome their aversion to Trump and still vote for him, or whether that is just so unacceptable that even if they disagree with Kamala Harris about a bunch of stuff, they\u2019re going to vote for her in the final stretch. That is probably the election-defining question. A spokesman for Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign said Donald Trump\u2019s comment about firing Jack Smith and his brags about the supreme court giving presidents immunity is proof he would govern as a dictator. \u201cDonald Trump thinks he\u2019s above the law, and these latest comments are right in line with the warnings made by Trump\u2019s former Chief of Staff that he wants to rule as a dictator with unchecked power,\u201d said Ammar Moussa, the campaign\u2019s director of rapid response. \u201cA second Trump term, where a more unstable and unhinged Trump has essentially no guardrails and is surrounded by loyalists who will enable his worst instincts, is guaranteed to be more dangerous. America can\u2019t risk a second Trump term.\u201d Donald Trump has vowed that if he returns to the White House, he will swiftly fire Jack Smith, the justice department special counsel who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents. In an interview today, conservative broadcaster Hugh Hewitt asked Trump if he would pardon himself or fire Smith. Trump meandered in his reply, before saying: It\u2019s so easy. I would fire him within two seconds. Trump also noted that \u201cwe got immunity at the Supreme Court,\u201d a reference to the ruling by the court\u2019s conservative majority this summer finding that presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. That complicated Smith\u2019s election meddling case against the former president, and played a part in it not going to trial prior to the 5 November election. Perhaps more interesting is this survey that the Guardian\u2019s Robert Tait wrote up yesterday showing that Arab Americans are now narrowly leaning towards Donald Trump, after strongly backing Joe Biden in 2020. That shift is likely a consequence of Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza following the 7 October attack, and could imperil Kamala Harris\u2019s chances of winning the White House. Here\u2019s more: Arab Americans are slightly more likely to vote for Donald Trump than Kamala Harris, according to a new poll, in a worrying sign for the Democratic nominee\u2019s chances of carrying the battleground state of Michigan, which is home to a large Arab American population. The survey, conducted by the Arab News Research and Studies Unit along with YouGov, shows 43% supporting Trump compared with 41% for Harris, and 4% backing the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein. The figures are broadly in line with a previous poll carried out this month by the Arab American Institute. Together they suggest that Harris\u2019s support in the community has been undermined by the Biden administration\u2019s backing for Israel\u2019s year-long war against Hamas in Gaza. The latest poll also shows Trump leading Harris by 39% to 33% on the question of which candidate would be most likely resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while the candidates were tied at 38% apiece on who would be \u201cbetter for the Middle East in general\u201d. Support for Trump is particularly striking given that the same poll shows twice as many respondents \u2013 46% to 23% \u2013 think anti-Arab racism and hate crimes are likely to increase under a Trump presidency compared with under Harris. Yesterday, Bloomberg News and Morning Consult released polling that found, like so many before it have, an essentially tied race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The survey heard from voters in all seven swing states, and found Trump leading by 1.5 percentage points in Georgia, 1.2 percentage points in North Carolina and 0.3 percentage points in Wisconsin. Harris was up by 0.4 percentage points in Arizona, 3.1 percentage points in Michigan, 0.5 percentage points in Nevada and 1.7 percentage points in Pennsylvania. Many of these findings are within the poll\u2019s one percentage point margin of error. Should the swing states end up voting the way they are leaning in this poll \u2013 and there\u2019s no telling that they will \u2013 Harris would win. For more of what polls are telling us, or not telling us, check out our tracker: NBC News has a little more detail on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s event with Kamala Harris in Houston tomorrow, specifically that she will be performing: Beyonc\u00e9 will appear with Kamala Harris in Houston on Friday, the Washington Post reports, when the vice-president visits the pop star\u2019s hometown to rally with Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred and attack abortion bans passed by Republicans. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song \u201cFreedom\u201d is regularly played at Harris\u2019s campaign events, though the singer has not appeared with the vice-president since she launched her campaign. Harris has been picking up the endorsements of a number of prominent musicians in recent weeks, including Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, who will do concerts with the campaign starting today in Atlanta. In addition to attempting to impeach Joe Biden, House Republicans have fixated on his legally troubled son Hunter Biden, looking for evidence of corruption by the president. They have not turned up much, despite issuing a flurry of subpoenas to Biden administration officials that have led to lengthy and complex litigation. Yesterday, one of the last outstanding matters came before a federal judge who became so frustrated with the squabble she invoked her dog. The hearing led to an agreement that will likely delay the release of any new information the Republicans are seeking until next year \u2013 at which point, there will be a new Congress, and Biden will no longer be in the White House. Politico was at the hearing, and explains more: A highly unusual ultimatum from a frustrated judge caused House Republican investigators to postpone their demand for testimony from two Justice Department tax attorneys in a probe of Hunter Biden\u2019s finances. \u201cI\u2019m willing to bet everything I own, plus my dog Scout, that these two line attorneys are going to have zero information to confirm your suspicion,\u201d U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes told a lawyer representing the House GOP on Wednesday. Reyes threatened to order Attorney General Merrick Garland and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to show up next week in her Washington courtroom for legal arguments on the dispute. \u201cDon\u2019t test me on this \u2026 I\u2019m not bluffing,\u201d said Reyes, an appointee of President Joe Biden who is often seen around the federal courthouse with her golden retriever. The fight emerged from House Republicans\u2019 long-running search for evidence that the White House exerted political pressure on officials who investigated the younger Biden\u2019s failure to pay income taxes. As part of that inquiry, the House Judiciary Committee tried to obtain testimony from two Justice Department tax lawyers who worked on the case. When the Justice Department resisted the House GOP\u2019s subpoenas to the two lawyers, the fight ended up before Reyes, who has been refereeing the dispute for months with increasing exasperation. During a two-hour hearing on Wednesday, she pressed lawyers for both sides to punt the dispute until next year. If they refused, she said, she would summon their bosses into court. After a brief recess, the House\u2019s top lawyer, Matthew Berry, and veteran Justice Department lawyer Elizabeth Shapiro told the judge they had agreed to shelve the matter until early next year. By that point, a new Congress and a new president will have been sworn in \u2014 developments likely to diminish both sides\u2019 appetite for a fight linked to an all-but-defunct effort to impeach Joe Biden. You don\u2019t hear so much about Congress these day, and there\u2019s a good reason for that. Both houses are in recess, and many lawmakers are back in their districts campaigning for re-election. But the Republican-led House judiciary committee will today convene in Milwaukee for a hearing titled \u201cThe Biden-Harris Border Crisis: Wisconsin Perspectives\u201d. It\u2019s not an accident that they are focusing on one of the issues Donald Trump is campaigning on in one of the swing states he needs to win. Led by his ally Jim Jordan, the committee has been at the forefront of ultimately fruitless effort to impeach Joe Biden, and quickly shifted to attacking Kamala Harris when she became the Democratic candidate in July. Expect this hearing to be a continuation of that offensive. Yesterday, another former Trump administration official told Politico that she agrees with John Kelly\u2019s assessment that the former president is a fascist, and said he has \u201cauthoritarian tendencies\u201d. \u201cDoes he have authoritarian tendencies? Yes,\u201d said Elizabeth Neumann, a former deputy chief of staff in the homeland security department. \u201cIs he kind of leaning towards that ultra-nationalism component? Absolutely. That is kind of his brand, right? He\u2019s made nationalism the new definition of the Republican Party.\u201d Neumann has already endorsed his opponent, Kamala Harris. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign spent yesterday hitting back at John Kelly, his former White House chief of staff who went public with his thoughts that his one-time boss was a fascist. While the president angrily condemned Kelly as \u201ca bad general\u201d in a Truth Social post, he didn\u2019t bring the subject up much at a Georgia rally in the evening, instead publicly insulting Kamala Harris. \u201cThis woman is crazy,\u201d he told an arena full of supporters in the Atlanta suburb of Duluth. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst ever. There\u2019s never been anybody like you. You can\u2019t put two sentences together. The world is laughing at us because of you.\u201d And more: She\u2019s not a smart person. She\u2019s a low IQ individual. It was all part of a campaign speech that was, in typical Trump 2024 form, lengthy and meandering, touching on everything from Richard Nixon to McDonald\u2019s. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin watched the whole thing, so you don\u2019t have to: A Republican city mayor in a Wisconsin county that has often swung elections in the battleground state has endorsed Kamala Harris, FOX6 News Milwaukee reports. Shawn Reilly is the mayor of Waukesha, the largest city in the county of the same name, which is also the most-populous Republican-voting county in the state that is viewed as crucial to Harris\u2019s hopes of winning the White House. He told the broadcaster that he\u2019s voting for the vice-president because he does not want Donald Trump to return to the White House: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult. The easy thing to do is just not say anything and cast my vote the way I want, but I think we\u2019re at a crossroads now,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cI feel in my heart that this is something that I need to come out and say: I am going to be voting for Vice President Harris to become our next president.\u201d Reilly voted third party in 2016 and for President Joe Biden in 2020 but kept that to himself. For other officers, he said he votes Republican \u201cmore often than not.\u201d Now this red city mayor is publicly endorsing blue for president. \u201cIt is a vote against Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI am terrified of Donald Trump becoming our next president for all the reasons I have indicated: he\u2019s already been impeached twice. He\u2019s been convicted of felonies and this is not what the United States needs.\u201d The chair of the state Democratic party, Ben Wikler, cheered Reilly\u2019s break from the GOP: Fred Upton, a Republican former congressman who represented a western Michigan district for 36 years, has endorsed Kamala Harris, the Detroit News reports. Upton, who was one of 10 Republicans to vote for Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment after January 6, said he had voted Democratic in a presidential election for the first time in his life because he is turned off by the former president\u2019s extremism and believes Harris will be more successful at governing with bipartisan support. \u201cWatching Trump day after day, he\u2019s ignored the advice of many senior, respected Republicans to stay on the issues,\u201d Upton said in an interview with the Detroit News. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s still talking about the election being stolen, trashing women left and right. He\u2019s just totally unhinged. We don\u2019t need this chaos. We need to move forward, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m where I am.\u201d The endorsement comes as Harris steps up her outreach to Republicans who she believes can be swayed against voting for Trump. Earlier this week, she campaigned alongside Liz Cheney, another Republican former congresswoman who lost her seat after breaking with the former president: When he speaks in Tempe, Arizona later today, one wonders if Donald Trump will address the allegation made by former model Stacey Williams in an interview with the Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner and Lucy Osborne that he groped her in 1993. She\u2019s the latest woman to come forward and say the then-real estate mogul put his hands on her without permission. Here\u2019s more: A former model who says she met Donald Trump through the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein has accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993, in what she believed was a \u201ctwisted game\u201d between the two men. Stacey Williams, who worked as a professional model in the 1990s, said she first met Trump in 1992 at a Christmas party after being introduced to him by Epstein, who she believed was a good friend of the then New York real estate developer. Williams said Epstein was interested in her and the two casually dated for a period of a few months. \u201cIt became very clear then that he and Donald were really, really good friends and spent a lot of time together,\u201d Williams said. The alleged groping occurred some months later, in the late winter or early spring of 1993, when Epstein suggested during a walk they were on that he and Williams stop by to visit Trump at Trump Tower. Epstein was later convicted on sex offenses and killed himself in prison in 2019. Moments after they arrived, she alleges, Trump greeted Williams, pulled her toward him and started groping her. She said he put his hands \u201call over my breasts\u201d as well as her waist and her buttocks. She said she froze because she was \u201cdeeply confused\u201d about what was happening. At the same time, she said she believed she saw the two men smiling at each other. Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, provided a statement denying the allegations, which said in part: \u201cThese accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false. It\u2019s obvious this fake story was contrived by the Harris campaign.\u201d The two lead actors in US politics (soon there will be only one) are scheduled to make a single appearance each today, as they look to clinch the support of swing state voters with little time left before the election. Kamala Harris will head to Georgia for a campaign event in Clarkston, outside Atlanta, at 7pm ET. She flies from there to Houston, Texas, where tomorrow, she\u2019s set to attack Donald Trump\u2019s abortion policy in a state that is not a swing state, but which moved swiftly to ban the procedure after Roe v Wade was overturned. She will also campaign with Colin Allred, the Democratic Senate candidate whose victory could allow the party to maintain its control of Congress\u2019s upper chamber, which the GOP is otherwise viewed as having a good shot at taking. As for Trump, he\u2019s having one of his usual rallies in a Tempe, Arizona arena at 4pm. Based on how his campaign advertised it, the former president will attack Harris and the Democrats over inflation, but Trump, of course, rarely stays on topic. An Arizona prosecutor said the man arrested in the shooting of a Democratic national committee office in suburban Phoenix had more than 120 guns and more than 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home, leading law enforcement to believe he may have been planning a mass casualty event. The Associated Press (AP) reports that Maricopa county prosecutor Neha Bhatia said at Jeffrey Michael Kelly\u2019s initial court appearance on Wednesday that federal agents told her about the large seizure made after Kelly\u2019s arrest. Scopes, body armour and silencers were also found, she said. A machine gun was discovered in the car he was driving. The sheer size of the cache led authorities to believe \u201cthis person was preparing to commit an act of mass casualty,\u201d Bhatia said. Police said Kelly, 60, allegedly fired BB pellets and then gunshots at the glass front door and a window of the Arizona Democrats\u2019 field office in Tempe. Police found three .22-caliber bullet casings while searching Kelly\u2019s trash, according to court documents, reports the AP. Nobody was inside during the shootings in the early morning hours of 16 September, 23 September and 6 October. The Tempe location was one of 18 Harris field offices in Arizona where Democrats gathered to organise Harris campaign efforts. It was shut down after the last shooting, police said. Kelly is also accused of hanging several political signs lined with razor blades on Tuesday in Ahwatukee, an affluent suburb of Phoenix where most voters have chosen Democrats in recent elections. Authorities said he also hung plastic bags holding a white powder labeled \u201cbiohazard\u201d from those signs. The AP reports that authorities said the hand-painted signs were attached to palm trees and appeared to criticise Democrats and their presidential nominee, vice-president Kamala Harris. Kelly was being held on three felony counts of acts of terrorism and four other counts related to the shootings, according to police. A $500,000 cash bond was set with a requirement for house arrest and an ankle monitor in the event he is able to raise that amount. His attorney Jason Squires said Kelly was a retired aerospace engineer who at one time had top security clearance, had no criminal record and was not a flight risk. Kelly\u2019s next appearance was set for the morning of 29 October in Maricopa county superior court. Political violence has already marred the campaign season, with the Republican presidential nominee being targeted by assassination attempts at a campaign rally and at one of Trump\u2019s Florida golf courses. Kamala Harris praised Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff for sending a \u201c911 call\u201d to the nation about the former president\u2019s unfitness to serve a second term, attacking her opponent as a \u201cfascist\u201d who would send the nation down a dangerous path. Harris participated in a CNN town hall with undecided voters in Delaware county, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, as the battleground state appears poised to play a potentially decisive role in the presidential race. While taking voters\u2019 questions on everything from the cost of living to abortion access, Harris repeatedly steered the conversation back to questions over Trump\u2019s fitness for office. The town hall came a day after the Atlantic published a story detailing former Trump advisers\u2019 accounts of the then president expressing a wish for \u201cthe kind of generals that Hitler had\u201d. The article quoted Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, John Kelly, who described the former president\u2019s consistent pattern of demeaning members of the military. The Trump campaign has denied these accounts. \u201cI do believe that Donald Trump is unstable, increasingly unstable, and unfit to serve,\u201d Harris told the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper at the town hall. She added: The people who know Donald Trump best, the people who worked with him in the White House \u2026 they have said explicitly he has contempt for the constitution of the United States. They have said he should never again serve as president of the United States.\u201d Harris predicted that, if elected to a second term, Trump would not have advisers like Kelly who might help put guardrails around the former president\u2019s behaviour in office. \u201c[Kelly] is just putting out a 911 call to the American people,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd this time, we must take very seriously, those folks who knew him best and were career people are not going to be there to hold him back.\u201d When asked explicitly by Cooper whether she considered Trump to be a fascist, Harris said, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d Here are some of the latest images on the newswires: Project 2025, the 900-page ultra-conservative roadmap that details how the former president Donald Trump and his allies would restructure the US government if he is elected, has specific implications for Black Americans, according to a new report. The Legal Defense Fund (LDF), an organisation that fights for racial justice, recently released the most in-depth legal analysis of Project 2025\u2019s impact on Black communities. It highlights how Black Americans would be harmed due to policies that would weaken anti-discrimination laws; dismantle the Department of Education; threaten Black political power; increase the use of the death penalty (which disproportionately affects Black people); and exacerbate health disparities caused by environmental racism. Karla McKanders, the director of the LDF\u2019s Thurgood Marshall Institute (TMI), the in-house research thinktank that produced the report, said she wanted people to understand the \u201clarger impact that Project 2025 will have on our democracy and undermining our democracy\u201d. The report is written in plain language and has been shared on social media, McKanders said, as the organization wants it to be available to a wide audience. \u201cThe most important part of the report is how Project 2025 will have an impact on individual lives and how those individual lives will be upended through the policy proposals.\u201d Of note, she said, are the report\u2019s chapters on education equity and political participation. Donald Trump implored supporters at a Georgia rally to vote for him \u2013 with an early ballot or in-person on election day \u2013 in a state that will be crucial in the presidential election. \u201cJust vote \u2013 whichever way you want to do it,\u201d Trump said at the event on Wednesday organised by conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk and the group he founded, reports the Associated Press (AP). But the rest of former president\u2019s speech and the lineup that preceded him framed the 2024 presidential election in stark terms. The Republican nominee insulted Kamala Harris while Kirk and other speakers used religious references and described the vice-president and her Democratic party as evil, reports the AP. Democrats \u201cstand for everything God hates,\u201d Kirk said, calling the Trump v Harris choice \u201ca spiritual battle\u201d. \u201cThis is a Christian state. I\u2019d like to see it stay that way,\u201d Kirk told the 10,000 or so Georgians, who at one point, the AP reports, joined Kirk in a deafening chant of \u201cChrist is King! Christ is King!\u201d Harris, who is a Baptist, used a CNN town hall in Philadelphia to describe Trump as fascistic, further crystallizing the nation\u2019s polarized posture with less than two weeks before the 5 November election. The Trump campaign strategy of encouraging supporters to consider every voting method is a turn from when blamed his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden on mail ballots; the number of people voting early has surged this year. Over 1.9 million voters have cast early ballots in Georgia, where Trump lost by a mere 11,779 votes four years ago to Biden. Voters nationwide have returned more than 23 million advance ballots in the 2024 general election. That has broken records in multiple states, partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Trump\u2019s direction. \u201cYou need to go to every single person you know and say, \u2018Are you voting for Trump?\u2019\u201d Kirk told the crowd. The AP reports that the 31-year-old Kirk has an outsize role in this year\u2019s election, using his online presence and the organisation he founded, Turning Point Action, to make himself one of the nation\u2019s most recognisable conservatives and a central part of Trump\u2019s operation. The former president has put a particular emphasis on courting younger men, the \u201cbro vote,\u201d trying to reach them through podcasts, social media and influencers such as Kirk. The rally, at the Gas South arena in Duluth, was filled with Turning Point\u2019s signature pyrotechnics, reports the AP. Trump used it to feature three figures who represent the populist coalition he is trying to assemble: Robert F Kennedy Jr, who ran his own campaign for president this year before endorsing Trump; former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat who announced this week that she is joining the Republican Party; and Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News commentator who has attracted millions of followers with his bravado-heavy social media presence. He added country music singer Jason Aldean, whose Try That in a Small Town single was a reaction to urban protests. Carlson whipped the crowd into a frenzy by reassuring them that liberals and political elites were the \u201cbizarre minority\u201d in US politics, while Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d supporters comprise a \u201cgentle, tolerant\u201d movement. According to the AP, Carlson cast Trump as America\u2019s \u201cDad\u201d and said a Trump victory over Harris would mean \u201cDad\u2019s home! And he\u2019s pissed!\u201d \u2013 while also being a \u201cbig middle finger wagging\u201d at \u201cthe worst people in the English-speaking world.\u201d Later in the night as Trump spoke, some in the crowd shouted out, \u201cDaddy\u2019s home!\u201d With less than two weeks until the US election, Madeleine Finlay speaks to climate activist and author Bill McKibben for the Guardian\u2019s Science Weekly podcast to find out what a win for Donald Trump could mean for the environment and the world\u2019s climate goals. You can listen to it here: Keir Starmer\u2019s hopes of meeting Kamala Harris before the US presidential election have faded, Downing Street has said. The UK prime minister said last month he aimed to meet both presidential candidates before American voters go to the polls on 5 November. He told reporters who had travelled with him to New York that it would be \u201cvery good to meet both [Trump and Harris] at some stage\u201d before the US election. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see what\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. Starmer did secure a meeting with Donald Trump while in New York for the UN general assembly in September. He and the former US president had a two-hour dinner, where they were joined by David Lammy, the foreign secretary. A government source said on Thursday that hopes of arranging a meeting between Starmer and Harris had faded. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously a number of days out from the campaign and I suspect both candidates are focused on the election,\u201d they said. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, refused to allow the newspaper\u2019s editorial board to endorse Kamala Harris for president, the former editor of the paper\u2019s opinion section told a media news outlet on Wednesday. Mariel Garza, a veteran California journalist who has worked for the Times\u2019 editorial board for nearly a decade, resigned from the paper in protest of Soon-Shiong\u2019s decision, she told the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR). \u201cIn dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I\u2019m standing up,\u201d Garza told CJR. Harris is the first presidential nominee from California in any political party since Ronald Reagan. In a long social media post on X, apparently written in response to Garza\u2019s comments, Soon-Shiong wrote that the Los Angeles Times editorial board had rejected a proposed alternative to a typical presidential endorsement editorial, which he described as \u201ca factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House, and how these policies affected the nation\u201d. Soon-Shiong wrote that the paper\u2019s opinion editors, who typically endorse one candidate each for a range of local and national offices and explains why each candidate is the best pick, were asked to instead present \u201cclear and non-partisan information side-by-side, [so] our readers could decide who would be worthy of being President for the next four years. \u201cInstead of adopting this path as suggested, the Editorial Board chose to remain silent and I accepted their decision,\u201d Soon-Shiong wrote. He ended with the words: \u201cPlease #vote.\u201d A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nearly 25 million Americans have already voted, less than two weeks out from the US election, with records broken in multiple battleground states, at least partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Donald Trump\u2019s direction. Either through in-person early voting or mail-in ballots, more than 1.9 million voters have cast early votes in Georgia, where Trump lost by a mere 11,779 votes four years ago to Democrat Joe Biden, while North Carolina also set a new record of more than 1.7m despite the chaos caused by Hurricane Helene last month. At an event in Georgia, Trump celebrated the state\u2019s record-breaking vote levels, and at a separate rally urged his supporters to \u201cjust vote \u2013 whichever way you want to do it.\u201d Donald Trump is expected to address Kamala Harris\u2019s economic policy at an afternoon rally in Tempe, Arizona, his campaign announced in a statement that said the vice-president had \u201cmade the American Dream of home ownership unreachable for young Americans and families.\u201d According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the pro-Trump Turning Point political action committee will then host the Republican ex-president at a Las Vegas rally aimed at recruiting volunteers and celebrating the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. \u201cThese are voters whose values closely align with the conservative platform but have been given too little attention by our movement,\u201d Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk said in a statement. AFP reports that Trump told supporters in North Carolina on Tuesday that former president Barack Obama was \u201ca real jerk\u201d and shrugged off his support for Harris. \u201cOver the last couple of days I\u2019ve watched him campaign,\u201d said the Republican, who held a spate of stops across Georgia on Wednesday. Trump said: What a divider he is. He divides this country. He couldn\u2019t care less, him and his little group of people.\u201d Harris and former first lady Michelle Obama are set to hold a rally this Saturday in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Kamala Harris will stage a star-studded rally on Thursday alongside Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen, as she launches a series of battleground state concerts to juice support in the final days of a nail-biting US presidential election. The Atlanta rally, Harris\u2019s first campaign stop with the only black president in US history, comes as an already bitter campaign is reaching new heights with the Democrat openly calling her Republican rival, Donald Trump, a \u201cfascist\u201d who presents a clear and present danger to US national security, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The contest remains a toss-up, with polling in all the swing states within the margin of error, and both campaigns have been pulling out the stops to win over undecided Americans and bank early votes ahead of 5 November. According to AFP, the Harris campaign said it planned gigs in all seven of the swing states expected to determine who wins the White House, with Springsteen back out on the campaign trail Monday in Philadelphia with Obama. The rock legend, whose socially conscious paeans to working-class struggle have made him one of the most popular artists in the US, has long lent his blue-collar appeal to Democratic campaigns. Joe Biden walked out to the Springsteen song \u201cWe Take Care of Our Own\u201d when he accepted victory in the 2020 election. The rocker \u2013 known as \u201cThe Boss\u201d \u2013 has campaigned for John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Obama in the past. Obama has been making his own headlining appearances in support of Harris and other Democrats in Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, five of the country\u2019s most closely-fought states. Party officials hope the former president, still one of the most popular Democrats on the national stage eight years after leaving office, will reverse eroding support among black voters, which is behind where it was for Biden in 2020. In other developments: Nearly 25 million Americans have already voted, less than two weeks out from the US election, with records broken in multiple battleground states, at least partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Donald Trump\u2019s direction. Pennsylvania\u2019s highest court allowed people whose mail ballots were rejected on technicalities to cast provisional ballots, likely affecting thousands of early voters. The decision was another defeat for the Republican National Committee\u2019s legal campaign, after it argued some provisional ballots cast during the April primary should have been rejected. A former model who says she met Donald Trump through the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein has accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993, in what she believed was a \u201ctwisted game\u201d between the two men. The Trump campaign called the allegations by Stacey Williams \u201cunequivocally false\u201d, calling it a fake story \u201ccontrived by the Harris campaign\u201d. Trump appeared in Zebulon, Georgia, with lieutenant governor and 2020 election denier Burt Jones, at a faith-focused event his campaign dubbed a \u201cBelievers and Ballots town hall\u201d. Trump praised tech mogul Elon Musk, for providing hurricane relief where he claimed the federal government did not. Writing on Truth Social, Trump assailed John Kelly as a \u201ca bad general\u201d gripped by \u201cpure Trump Derangement Syndrome Hatred\u201d. Kelly, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff and a retired Marine general, on Tuesday said he believed Trump met the definition of \u201cfascist\u201d and was \u201ccertainly an authoritarian\u201d. Two retired army officers said they agreed with Kelly, while Republicans including the governor of New Hampshire dismissed the comments. Kamala Harris denounced Trump as a \u201cfascist\u201d who wants \u201cunchecked power\u201d and a military personally loyal to him. In a surprise speech from her Washington DC residence, the Democratic nominee jumped on Kelly\u2019s claims. Joe Biden\u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said the president also agreed with those calling Trump a fascist. Harris repeated the fascist claim during a televised town hall with undecided voters in Delaware County, outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In response to CNN moderator Anderson Cooper asking her: \u201cLet me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?\u201d, Harris answered: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d Trump was invited to attend the same town hall but declined. Trump stayed in Georgia for a rally in Duluth with guests Tucker Carlson, Robert F Kennedy Jr, and former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. He escalated his personal insults against Kamala Harris, saying she was \u201ccrazy\u201d and inviting voters to tell his opponent: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re the worst ever. There\u2019s never been anybody like you. You can\u2019t put two sentences together. The world is laughing at us because of you.\u2019\u201d China-linked social media bots are targeting Republicans including Marco Rubio, according to new research from Microsoft, while a senior US intelligence official said groups in Russia created and helped spread viral disinformation targeting Tim Walz. The US justice department warned Musk\u2019s Super Pac that the billionaire and Tesla CEO\u2019s $1m-a-day giveaways may violate federal law, according to multiple reports. Musk, who has thrown his support behind Trump, announced on Saturday while speaking before a crowd in Pennsylvania that he was giving away $1m each day until election day to someone who signs his online petition supporting the US constitution. Harris\u2019s campaign announced she will deliver a major \u201cclosing argument\u201d address next week in the same location that Donald Trump rallied January 6 rioters before they stormed the US Capitol in 2021. Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz voted early along with his wife, Gwen, and son, Gus. Leaving the voting booth in St Paul, Minnesota, Walz said his vote was \u201can opportunity to turn the page on the chaos of Donald Trump and a new way forward\u201d. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, Harris\u2019s husband, rallied Democrats in Florida, marking a break from his recent stumping in more competitive states including Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Both parties expect the Sunshine state to once more swing for Trump, but the Harris campaign\u2019s rare foray drew attention to the close Senate race between the Republican incumbent and Democratic challenger. The Los Angeles Times opinion editor resigned after the newspaper\u2019s owner blocked the masthead from endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Mariel Garza said she was standing up against the decision by Patrick Soon-Shiong, the paper\u2019s billionaire owner.
