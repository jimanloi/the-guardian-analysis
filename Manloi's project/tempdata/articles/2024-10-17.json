      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris has hailed the death of Yahya Sinwar as an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza and prepare for \u201cthe day after\u201d when Hamas no longer dominates the territory. The US vice-president and Democratic nominee said \u201cjustice has been served\u201d with the death of the Hamas leader, adding that the US, Israel and the wider world were \u201cbetter off as a result\u201d. Locked in a titanic election contest with Donald Trump to win the battleground state of Michigan, home to a large Arab-American voting bloc sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, Harris also pressed for an end to the year-long hostilities that have killed more than 42,000 people in Gaza and left a trail of destruction in the territory. \u201cHamas is decimated and its leadership is eliminated,\u201d she said. \u201cThis moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza.\u201d The end of the conflict had to be accompanied by security for Israel, the release of the remaining hostages and an end to suffering in Gaza, she said. She also hinted at her support for Palestinian statehood by saying it should herald Palestinians\u2019 rights to \u201cdignity, security, freedom and self-determination\u201d. Her comments chimed with those of Joe Biden, who has been criticised by progressives for unstinting support for Israel even while Benjamin Netanyahu had ignored his entreaties to avoid civilian casualties and ease humanitarian suffering in the tiny coastal territory. \u201cIsrael has had every right to eliminate the leadership and military structure of Hamas,\u201d Biden said in comments that appeared designed to answer criticisms of his support. He said Sinwar had represented an \u201cinsurmountable obstacle\u201d to a better future for Israelis and Palestinians. \u201cThat obstacle no longer exists. But much work remains before us,\u201d he said. Biden said he would talk to Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders about \u201cending this war once and for all\u201d. After the two leaders spoke late on Thursday, the White House said they \u201cdiscussed how to use this moment to bring the hostages home and to bring the war to a close with Israel\u2019s security assured and Hamas never again able to control Gaza\u201d. However, Netanyahu \u2013 who has been accused of stalling a ceasefire deal \u2013 hinted that the conflict was far from over. \u201cThe war is still ongoing,\u201d he said in a televised speech late on Thursday. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, called Sinwar \u2013 the architect of the 7 October attack on Israel \u2013 a \u201cvicious and unrepentant terrorist\u201d and said he had repeatedly torpedoed agreements that would have ended the conflict. \u201cOn multiple occasions over the past months, Sinwar rebuffed efforts by the United States and its partners to bring this war to a close through an agreement that would return the hostages to their families and alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people,\u201d Blinken said. The news was also welcomed by US congressional leaders. The Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, said Sinwar\u2019s life was \u201cthe embodiment of evil and marked by hatred for all that is good in the world\u201d. \u201cHis death brings hope for all those who seek to live in freedom, and relief to Israelis he has sought to oppress,\u201d Johnson said. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader, said he hoped the event would lead to \u201can end to hostilities that will ensure the security of the Israeli people and provide full humanitarian relief and a new path forward for the people of Gaza\u201d. The former CIA director David Petraeus told the BBC that Sinwar\u2019s death was \u201cbigger than\u201d the assassination of Osama bin Laden by US special forces in 2011, being \u201cboth hugely symbolic \u2026 but also hugely operational\u201d because Sinwar was the overall leader of Hamas.

      "body": "<h2>Spurs seek to avoid Postecoglou strain</h2> <p>If Ange Postecoglou refuses to change his style, and Tottenham simply cannot change their culture, where does that leave both parties? Spurs are still some way off a crisis, but it\u2019s an impasse that could cause combustion. \u201cI didn\u2019t get here by doing what everyone else is doing,\u201d Postecoglou told Australian media this week, saying that \u201csitting\u201d on the Brighton loss \u2013 in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/never-underestimate-the-true-spursiness-of-this-tottenham-team\">Spurs completely collapsed</a> in the second half \u2013 has made for an agonising international break. Despite winning five on the bounce before the trip to the south coast, anything less than victory against West Ham will put further strain on the relationship between Tottenham\u2019s manager and their supporters, which can increasingly lurch from one extreme to the other. <strong>Dominic Booth</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Tottenham v West Ham, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Thrilling Traor\u00e9 needs finishing touch</h2> <p>Not many wingers can make Kyle Walker eat dust. Then again, not many wingers are as quick or strong as Adama Traor\u00e9. However, the 28-year-old is still searching for an end product to match his coruscating speed. Getting into goalscoring positions is not the problem. Traor\u00e9 had three clear opportunities during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/manchester-city-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">Fulham\u2019s defeat by Manchester City</a> earlier this month but was unable to produce a clinical finish on each occasion. It was frustrating to watch and Fulham will hope to see an improvement from the Spain international when they host Aston Villa. Traor\u00e9, who has one goal this season, has so much going for him. He would be devastating if he could find more composure. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Fulham v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Stakes high for Ipswich and Everton</h2> <p>Eight games in and it\u2019s already relegation six-pointer time. Ipswich in 17th are one of the Premier League\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/17/winless-but-not-hopeless-what-is-going-on-at-premier-leagues-bottom-four\">four winless wonders</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/28/everton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">beating Crystal Palace on 28 September</a> Everton, 16th, exited that select club, and next <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/everton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">held Newcastle to a draw</a> thanks to Jordan Pickford saving a penalty from Anthony Gordon. Evertonians will hope for more of the same, rather than the chaotic performance Pickford delivered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/10/england-greece-nations-league-match-report\">against Greece for England</a> last week. Ipswich will seek to bounce back from their first poor performance of the season at West Ham, who drove a bus through Kieran McKenna\u2019s adventurous tactics in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/west-ham-ipswich-premier-league-match-report\">winning 4-1</a>, particularly during a ruinous second half full of poor defending. Axel Tuanzebe\u2019s continued absence after cutting his hand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/08/ipswich-axel-tuanzebe-layoff-after-freak-accident-while-washing-up\">in the depths of a washing-up bowl</a> is a significant blow to Ipswich\u2019s defence. Similarly, Everton have missed Jarrad Branthwaite, whose comeback in that Palace game visibly improved the team before he then tweaked a thigh muscle. He is back in training. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Ipswich </em><em>v Everton, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>United\u2019s questions and doubts pile up</h2> <p>All eyes on the executive box at Old Trafford to see if Sir Alex Ferguson, his lucrative ambassador stipend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/15/manchester-united-alex-ferguson-ambassador-role-cuts-ineos-ratcliffe\">chopped by Sir Jim Ratcliffe</a>, takes his seat. Meanwhile, Erik ten Hag fights on, his employment prospects probably improved by Thomas Tuchel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/16/thomas-tuchel-confirmed-as-new-england-manager-from-2025\">becoming England manager</a>. United\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/aston-villa-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">dour, forgettable draw at Aston Villa</a> also becalmed the whirl of speculation if not the run of injuries that have plagued the Dutchman\u2019s reign. The loss of Harry Maguire has added to selection problems, as have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/10/manchester-uniteds-mazraoui-sidelined-after-procedure-for-palpitations\">Noussair Mazraoui\u2019s heart palpitations</a> requiring minor corrective surgery. Manuel Ugarte is also reported to have a sustained a muscle problem while on international duty with Uruguay. The midfielder is an expensive signing supposed to anchor the midfield but has completed 90 minutes for United only once, his new manager seemingly reluctant to use him. Has something similar occurred with Matthijs de Ligt, who was dropped for the game against Villa? <strong>JB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Manchester United v Brentford, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Minteh out to prove point on Tyneside</h2> <p>Yankuba Minteh makes his first return to Newcastle since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/29/liverpool-remain-interested-in-anthony-gordon-with-psg-circling-too\">joining Brighton for \u00a333m</a> in late June. In reality the 20-year-old Gambia right winger was very rarely on Tyneside after signing from Odense for just under \u00a36m in the summer of 2023. Almost immediately after arriving, a purchase driven by the club\u2019s former sporting director Dan Ashworth, Minteh went out on a season-long loan to Feyenoord. After starring under Arne Slot last term, Eddie Howe harboured high hopes for Minteh but, instead, PSR concerns prompted a rushed sale that some at St James\u2019 Park fear will prove a huge mistake. So far this season he has started five of Brighton\u2019s seven league games, scoring his first goal for Fabian H\u00fcrzeler\u2019s side in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/brighton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">the 3-2 comeback win against Tottenham</a>. The winger is said to have been extremely reluctant to leave Newcastle but now he threatens to show his former public, manager and teammates precisely what they are missing. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Newcastle v Brighton, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Will pragmatic Foxes stymie Saints?</h2> <p>Southampton seek to break their Premier League duck after a pair of very different 3-1 defeats. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/30/bournemouth-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">losing at Bournemouth</a>, Russell Martin laid into his players, \u201churt by the lack of spirit and fight\u201d while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">after Arsenal</a> he had \u201ctaken a lot of heart, encouragement and belief from the performance\u201d. Despite Saints\u2019 results, a significant proportion of fans are supportive of Martin\u2019s commitment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/14/is-it-naive-for-a-promoted-side-to-play-possession-football-in-the-premier-league\">to his style of football</a>. The same may not be true of Leicester\u2019s supporters for their manager. Perhaps it is the Nottingham Forest connection, perhaps it\u2019s that Steve Cooper\u2019s pragmatism means Leicester no longer play in the adventurous fashion they did under Enzo Maresca. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/leicester-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">win over Bournemouth</a> last time out was Leicester\u2019s first victory in the league. Cooper\u2019s star man has been Facundo Buonanotte, the Brighton loanee. It is hoped his journey back from Argentina\u2019s World Cup qualifiers is comfortable enough for him to be included. <strong>JB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Southampton v Leicester, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Merino in but Saka out for Gunners?</h2> <p>The break was both a blessing and a curse for Mikel Arteta. He will have been buoyed by the sight of Mikel Merino turning out for Spain in their Nations League victories over Denmark and Serbia, the summer signing playing 90 minutes across the two fixtures. It will surely give Merino\u2019s club manager the green light to unleash him alongside Declan Rice at Bournemouth in his preferred midfield pairing. Yet the break also brought pain for Arsenal as Bukayo Saka hobbled off in England\u2019s Nations League nightmare against Greece. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/12/bukayo-saka-ruled-out-england-game-back-to-arsenal-treatment-injury\">The winger\u2019s injury</a> may provide another hurdle for Arteta to clear in his quest to topple Pep Guardiola and Manchester City. The Gunners have been largely fortunate with injuries in the past two seasons as they\u2019ve challenged for the title, but the busy schedule means that was unlikely to last for ever. <strong>DB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bournemouth v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>City\u2019s McAtee making moves</h2> <p>Few players had a more bittersweet international break than James McAtee. The 21-year-old Manchester City midfielder scored three times for England Under-21s, including twice against Ukraine, the first of which was a rasping free-kick. After the game McAtee dedicated his double <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/10/george-baldock-greek-police-no-evidence-criminal-activity-caused-death\">to George Baldock</a>, whom he spent two years alongside while on loan at Sheffield United. \u201cWhen I was there he welcomed me with open arms, he looked after me,\u201d said McAtee, who celebrated by lifting his shirt to reveal a message which read: \u201cGB 2 REST EASY BROTHER X.\u201d McAtee, a fixture in City\u2019s squads this season, is unlikely to start at Wolves on Sunday but, having scored on his last club appearance, in a 4-0 Champions League win <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/01/slovan-bratislava-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">against Slovan Bratislava</a> at the start of this month, if required Pep Guardiola knows he can turn to a man in form. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Wolves v Manchester City, Sunday 2pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Shuffled backlines for Anfield clash</h2> <p>Arne Slot and Enzo Maresca have benefited from relatively settled defences throughout their impressive starts to life at Liverpool and Chelsea, with the former boasting the best defensive record in the Premier League at present, but both face disruption to their backlines for what should be a revealing contest at Anfield. The visitors will be without the suspended Wesley Fofana and Marc Cucurella after each collected a fifth booking of the season in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/chelsea-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">the feisty draw</a> with Nottingham Forest before the international break. Mohamed Salah\u2019s duel with Renato Veiga, Cucurella\u2019s potential replacement at left-back, could be intriguing. Liverpool\u2019s loss is limited to one, but a hugely influential one nonetheless, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/09/liverpool-hit-with-huge-injury-setback-as-alisson-is-ruled-out-for-six-weeks-hamstring\">with Alisson sidelined</a> until after November\u2019s international break with his second hamstring injury of the campaign. Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher proved an able deputy in the wins over Bournemouth and West Ham, as the Republic of Ireland international usually does, and possesses the temperament to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/13/greece-seal-win-over-republic-of-ireland-after-caoimhin-kelleher-blunder\">Sunday\u2019s mistake against Greece</a> immediately behind him. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Liverpool v Chelsea, Sunday 4.30pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Forest facing out-of-sorts Eagles</h2> <p>It\u2019s a battle between two of the surprise packages under the Monday night lights. But while Nottingham Forest have defied most pre-season predictions by losing just one of their first seven games, Crystal Palace have confounded expectations for the wrong reasons. It\u2019s too early to suggest Oliver Glasner\u2019s job is in danger given the impact he had last season, but the fact Palace have failed to win a league game so far cannot simply be explained by the summer sale of Michael Olise. There\u2019s been a bluntness to the Eagles, a lack of cohesion the Austrian must address, starting with this trip. With games against Tottenham and Aston Villa lurking around the corner, it won\u2019t get any easier. The glimmer of hope for Glasner is Forest\u2019s home form; they\u2019ve not won at home in four attempts in all competitions this season. <strong>DB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Nottingham Forest v

      "bodyText": "Spurs seek to avoid Postecoglou strain If Ange Postecoglou refuses to change his style, and Tottenham simply cannot change their culture, where does that leave both parties? Spurs are still some way off a crisis, but it\u2019s an impasse that could cause combustion. \u201cI didn\u2019t get here by doing what everyone else is doing,\u201d Postecoglou told Australian media this week, saying that \u201csitting\u201d on the Brighton loss \u2013 in which Spurs completely collapsed in the second half \u2013 has made for an agonising international break. Despite winning five on the bounce before the trip to the south coast, anything less than victory against West Ham will put further strain on the relationship between Tottenham\u2019s manager and their supporters, which can increasingly lurch from one extreme to the other. Dominic Booth Tottenham v West Ham, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST) Thrilling Traor\u00e9 needs finishing touch Not many wingers can make Kyle Walker eat dust. Then again, not many wingers are as quick or strong as Adama Traor\u00e9. However, the 28-year-old is still searching for an end product to match his coruscating speed. Getting into goalscoring positions is not the problem. Traor\u00e9 had three clear opportunities during Fulham\u2019s defeat by Manchester City earlier this month but was unable to produce a clinical finish on each occasion. It was frustrating to watch and Fulham will hope to see an improvement from the Spain international when they host Aston Villa. Traor\u00e9, who has one goal this season, has so much going for him. He would be devastating if he could find more composure. Jacob Steinberg Fulham v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm Stakes high for Ipswich and Everton Eight games in and it\u2019s already relegation six-pointer time. Ipswich in 17th are one of the Premier League\u2019s four winless wonders. In beating Crystal Palace on 28 September Everton, 16th, exited that select club, and next held Newcastle to a draw thanks to Jordan Pickford saving a penalty from Anthony Gordon. Evertonians will hope for more of the same, rather than the chaotic performance Pickford delivered against Greece for England last week. Ipswich will seek to bounce back from their first poor performance of the season at West Ham, who drove a bus through Kieran McKenna\u2019s adventurous tactics in winning 4-1, particularly during a ruinous second half full of poor defending. Axel Tuanzebe\u2019s continued absence after cutting his hand in the depths of a washing-up bowl is a significant blow to Ipswich\u2019s defence. Similarly, Everton have missed Jarrad Branthwaite, whose comeback in that Palace game visibly improved the team before he then tweaked a thigh muscle. He is back in training. John Brewin Ipswich v Everton, Saturday 3pm United\u2019s questions and doubts pile up All eyes on the executive box at Old Trafford to see if Sir Alex Ferguson, his lucrative ambassador stipend chopped by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, takes his seat. Meanwhile, Erik ten Hag fights on, his employment prospects probably improved by Thomas Tuchel becoming England manager. United\u2019s dour, forgettable draw at Aston Villa also becalmed the whirl of speculation if not the run of injuries that have plagued the Dutchman\u2019s reign. The loss of Harry Maguire has added to selection problems, as have Noussair Mazraoui\u2019s heart palpitations requiring minor corrective surgery. Manuel Ugarte is also reported to have a sustained a muscle problem while on international duty with Uruguay. The midfielder is an expensive signing supposed to anchor the midfield but has completed 90 minutes for United only once, his new manager seemingly reluctant to use him. Has something similar occurred with Matthijs de Ligt, who was dropped for the game against Villa? JB Manchester United v Brentford, Saturday 3pm Minteh out to prove point on Tyneside Yankuba Minteh makes his first return to Newcastle since joining Brighton for \u00a333m in late June. In reality the 20-year-old Gambia right winger was very rarely on Tyneside after signing from Odense for just under \u00a36m in the summer of 2023. Almost immediately after arriving, a purchase driven by the club\u2019s former sporting director Dan Ashworth, Minteh went out on a season-long loan to Feyenoord. After starring under Arne Slot last term, Eddie Howe harboured high hopes for Minteh but, instead, PSR concerns prompted a rushed sale that some at St James\u2019 Park fear will prove a huge mistake. So far this season he has started five of Brighton\u2019s seven league games, scoring his first goal for Fabian H\u00fcrzeler\u2019s side in the 3-2 comeback win against Tottenham. The winger is said to have been extremely reluctant to leave Newcastle but now he threatens to show his former public, manager and teammates precisely what they are missing. Louise Taylor Newcastle v Brighton, Saturday 3pm Will pragmatic Foxes stymie Saints? Southampton seek to break their Premier League duck after a pair of very different 3-1 defeats. After losing at Bournemouth, Russell Martin laid into his players, \u201churt by the lack of spirit and fight\u201d while after Arsenal he had \u201ctaken a lot of heart, encouragement and belief from the performance\u201d. Despite Saints\u2019 results, a significant proportion of fans are supportive of Martin\u2019s commitment to his style of football. The same may not be true of Leicester\u2019s supporters for their manager. Perhaps it is the Nottingham Forest connection, perhaps it\u2019s that Steve Cooper\u2019s pragmatism means Leicester no longer play in the adventurous fashion they did under Enzo Maresca. The win over Bournemouth last time out was Leicester\u2019s first victory in the league. Cooper\u2019s star man has been Facundo Buonanotte, the Brighton loanee. It is hoped his journey back from Argentina\u2019s World Cup qualifiers is comfortable enough for him to be included. JB Southampton v Leicester, Saturday 3pm Merino in but Saka out for Gunners? The break was both a blessing and a curse for Mikel Arteta. He will have been buoyed by the sight of Mikel Merino turning out for Spain in their Nations League victories over Denmark and Serbia, the summer signing playing 90 minutes across the two fixtures. It will surely give Merino\u2019s club manager the green light to unleash him alongside Declan Rice at Bournemouth in his preferred midfield pairing. Yet the break also brought pain for Arsenal as Bukayo Saka hobbled off in England\u2019s Nations League nightmare against Greece. The winger\u2019s injury may provide another hurdle for Arteta to clear in his quest to topple Pep Guardiola and Manchester City. The Gunners have been largely fortunate with injuries in the past two seasons as they\u2019ve challenged for the title, but the busy schedule means that was unlikely to last for ever. DB Bournemouth v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm City\u2019s McAtee making moves Few players had a more bittersweet international break than James McAtee. The 21-year-old Manchester City midfielder scored three times for England Under-21s, including twice against Ukraine, the first of which was a rasping free-kick. After the game McAtee dedicated his double to George Baldock, whom he spent two years alongside while on loan at Sheffield United. \u201cWhen I was there he welcomed me with open arms, he looked after me,\u201d said McAtee, who celebrated by lifting his shirt to reveal a message which read: \u201cGB 2 REST EASY BROTHER X.\u201d McAtee, a fixture in City\u2019s squads this season, is unlikely to start at Wolves on Sunday but, having scored on his last club appearance, in a 4-0 Champions League win against Slovan Bratislava at the start of this month, if required Pep Guardiola knows he can turn to a man in form. Ben Fisher Wolves v Manchester City, Sunday 2pm Shuffled backlines for Anfield clash Arne Slot and Enzo Maresca have benefited from relatively settled defences throughout their impressive starts to life at Liverpool and Chelsea, with the former boasting the best defensive record in the Premier League at present, but both face disruption to their backlines for what should be a revealing contest at Anfield. The visitors will be without the suspended Wesley Fofana and Marc Cucurella after each collected a fifth booking of the season in the feisty draw with Nottingham Forest before the international break. Mohamed Salah\u2019s duel with Renato Veiga, Cucurella\u2019s potential replacement at left-back, could be intriguing. Liverpool\u2019s loss is limited to one, but a hugely influential one nonetheless, with Alisson sidelined until after November\u2019s international break with his second hamstring injury of the campaign. Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher proved an able deputy in the wins over Bournemouth and West Ham, as the Republic of Ireland international usually does, and possesses the temperament to put Sunday\u2019s mistake against Greece immediately behind him. Andy Hunter Liverpool v Chelsea, Sunday 4.30pm Forest facing out-of-sorts Eagles It\u2019s a battle between two of the surprise packages under the Monday night lights. But while Nottingham Forest have defied most pre-season predictions by losing just one of their first seven games, Crystal Palace have confounded expectations for the wrong reasons.

A poll last weekend by the Kyodo news agency put the LDP on 26.4%, well ahead of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party on 12.4%.</p> <p>However, a new poll by the Nikkei suggests the party could fail to secure a majority \u2013 a result that the business newspaper says would \u201cpotentially set the stage for political turmoil not seen since 2009\u201d, which is the last time the party lost a lower house election.</p> <p>The LDP is aiming to retain at least 233 seats to secure an outright majority \u2013 a modest ambition given its current total of 256 seats. </p> <h2>A PM under pressure</h2> <p>The party\u2019s dominance of Japan\u2019s postwar political landscape has not been absolute. In 2009, voters ousted the LDP in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/31/japan-elections-yukio-hatoyama\">shock result</a> that saw the left-of-centre Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) take office under prime minister Yukio Hatoyama. For once, the traditionally fragmented opposition had achieved a level of unity that made the DPJ a serious electoral prospect.</p> <p>Analysts attributed the DPJ\u2019s victory to fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis, a growing income gap, a damaging scandal over the loss of millions of pension records and the LDP\u2019s deeply unpopular prime minister, Taro Aso, whose cabinet approval rating going into the election sank to just over 16%.</p> <p>The LDP\u2019s time in the wilderness was short lived, however.

      "bodyText": "Bruised by months of financial scandals, a cost-of-living crisis and unpopular leaders, some might be forgiven for expecting to see the end of Japan\u2019s beleaguered ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), which has been in office for most of the past seven decades. The election on 27 October will take place a year earlier than many had expected, following the surprise resignation of the former prime minister, Fumio Kishida, following record low approval ratings and public anger over his party\u2019s apparent addiction to in \u201cmoney politics\u201d. His successor, Shigeru Ishiba, was selected last month by party MPs and rank-and-file member to revive the LDP\u2019s fortunes and douse the flames of a factional war that saw Ishiba narrowly fend off a challenge from the party\u2019s right. Yet even at a time of political turmoil, polling suggests many believe the party will go into the 465-seat lower house election reasonably confident it would be returned to office for the fifth time in succession. Some polls even showed the LDP would retain its majority, aided by a projected low turnout and a divided opposition. A poll last weekend by the Kyodo news agency put the LDP on 26.4%, well ahead of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party on 12.4%. However, a new poll by the Nikkei suggests the party could fail to secure a majority \u2013 a result that the business newspaper says would \u201cpotentially set the stage for political turmoil not seen since 2009\u201d, which is the last time the party lost a lower house election. The LDP is aiming to retain at least 233 seats to secure an outright majority \u2013 a modest ambition given its current total of 256 seats. A PM under pressure The party\u2019s dominance of Japan\u2019s postwar political landscape has not been absolute. In 2009, voters ousted the LDP in a shock result that saw the left-of-centre Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) take office under prime minister Yukio Hatoyama. For once, the traditionally fragmented opposition had achieved a level of unity that made the DPJ a serious electoral prospect. Analysts attributed the DPJ\u2019s victory to fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis, a growing income gap, a damaging scandal over the loss of millions of pension records and the LDP\u2019s deeply unpopular prime minister, Taro Aso, whose cabinet approval rating going into the election sank to just over 16%. The LDP\u2019s time in the wilderness was short lived, however. Hatoyama lasted less than a year, forced out by his failure to realise a campaign pledge to reduce the US military burden on the southern island of Okinawa. His two successors fared little better, and at the end of 2012 normal service resumed with the election of an LDP government led by Shinzo Abe. Tobias Harris, founder of the advisory firm Japan Foresight, said Ishiba could struggle to introduce legislation if the LDP and Komeito together lose enough seats to weaken the coalition\u2019s control of key parliamentary committees. That would \u201cnot only fundamentally undermine his claims to be an electoral asset for the party \u2026 but would also compromise any efforts to clean up and modernise the party and unify it under his leadership\u201d, Harris said. Ishiba\u2019s victory in the LDP leadership race raised hopes that a gentler version of LDP would emerge from the upheaval of recent months. He is widely seen as a moderate alternative to the ultra-conservative Sanae Takaichi, his main rival. The 67-year-old, a softly spoken former banker whose hobby is making model warplanes and ships, had indicated he supported same-sex marriages, reigning empresses and the right of married couples to use different surnames \u2013 social and cultural shifts his party has opposed, in defiance of public opinion. Ishiba had also vowed to take tough action against LDP lawmakers who plunged the party into crisis after revelations they had siphoned unreported profits from the sale of tickets for party events into secret slush funds. Concerns linger, too, over his party\u2019s ties to the scandal-hit Unification church. But in an apparent attempt to placate his rightwing opponents inside the LDP, Ishiba has backpedalled since becoming prime minister, telling parliament last week that changing the law on married surnames \u2013 in which women almost always take their husband\u2019s name \u2013 and the ban on gay marriages \u201crequire further examination\u201d. He refused to comment on any reforms to Japan\u2019s male-only succession laws. Critics have also accused him of abandoning promises to address the funding scandal. The LDP has refused to endorse 12 candidates found to have committed the most serious misdemeanours but will not oppose them at the election. Ishiba has said they may even be welcomed back into the LDP fold if they win. And while a record 314 women will be competing for seats \u2013 female MPs currently make up just over a tenth of all lower house members \u2013 the lower house is not expected to look dramatically different. About 10% of all candidates hail from political families, including Ishiba, who \u201cinherited\u201d his father\u2019s former seat in rural Tottori prefecture in 1986.",

(Yurick drew on his experience working for the city\u2019s welfare department.)

The gang members are vividly portrayed by Kenita Miller, Sasha Hutchings, Phillipa Soo, Aneesa Folds, Amber Gray, Gizel Jim\u00e9nez, Jasmine Cephas Jones, many of them Hamilton alumni, as is Julia Harriman who plays their new recruit, Mercy. In the film, Mercy is all mouth, demeaned by the men and mostly reduced to a love interest; the album gets to her heart and gives Harriman a standout solo, Call Me Mercy, whose poignant yearning is all the more striking for following a very funny interlude with the resentful, small-fry Orphans (Casey Likes and Utkarsh Ambudkar).</p> <p>One of the album\u2019s joys is its unexpected pairings, especially how musical theatre stars are matched with acts from other genres. Broadway\u2019s Alex Boniello teams up with Australian metalcore artist Kim Dracula as the Rogues on a rat-a-tat-tat duet, Going Down, that manages to veer from monstrous destruction to soaring anthem and back again. Dracula channels the toddler rage of the film\u2019s arch-villain Luther (original star David Patrick Kelly gets an album cameo as a cop), and as you\u2019d expect his taunt \u201ccome out to play\u201d becomes a thunderous hook.</p> <p>Liberally repeating other catchphrases, as well as the Riffs\u2019 military cadences and even Norman Mailer\u2019s \u201carmies of the night\u201d from the film\u2019s poster, this pacy album also namechecks US sprinter Wilma Rudolph but really it judders along like the film\u2019s graffiti-sprayed subway trains.

Listeners are given just enough meaningful time hanging out with the gang through snippets of sparky dialogue, while the songs carry sound effects of sirens, thunder and spray paint.

The project draws on the experiences of drug users to create tailored 3D experiences, such as being alone in a flat or at a party with friends, where people can be immersed via a VR headset in realistic situations that trigger the urge to take drugs. Studies have shown that \u201ccue exposure treatment\u201d can substantially reduce cravings and relapse in recovering alcoholics, but the approach has not been fully tested as a potential treatment for cocaine addiction. Paolo Deluca, the lead researcher and a professor of addiction research at King\u2019s College London, said the virtual reality world should help users break the association between tempting scenarios and their cocaine use, and give them time to practise strategies for refusing drugs. \u201cWe are trying to better understand the scenarios \u2013 the cues and interactions \u2013 that trigger cravings in people who use cocaine,\u201d he said. The work is one of 11 projects announced on Friday as part of a \u00a312m government investment to reduce drug overdoses through virtual reality, artificial intelligence and wearable technology. Across Britain, drug overdoses claim nearly 5,000 lives each year. Several of the new projects will run from Scotland, which has the highest rate of drug deaths in Europe. Another project backed by the programme is investigating whether a wearable device that talks to a chest-worn breathing monitor can detect when a person has overdosed. If the device suspects an overdose, it alerts emergency services that have access to an antidote in the hope of delivering the potentially life-saving treatment faster. One of the most effective antidotes for heroin or methadone overdose is naloxone, but the treatment is typically available only as an injection or nasal spray and cannot always be used in time. To make the drug more accessible, another team at King\u2019s is looking into naloxone wafers that can deliver the antidote by melting in the mouth.

The medications affect the brain\u2019s mesolimbic system, reducing appetite and triggering satisfaction after eating. But they may also affect reward pathways in the brain that play an important role in substance abuse. Matt Field, a professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield, said they could reduce hospitalisations from heroin and alcohol abuse but it was unclear whether they helped people cut down on how often they used the substances. \u201cWe already have things such as naloxone which are specifically intended for rapid treatment of heroin overdose, and they work very well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best way to avoid \u2018alcohol intoxication\u2019 is to avoid drinking huge amounts, and the big question is whether Ozempic helps people to do this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Liam Payne died of multiple traumas and internal and external bleeding caused by a fall from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, the Argentinian prosecutor\u2019s office has said. An autopsy showed that the pop star\u2019s head injuries were sufficient to cause death. An investigation \u2013 including the interview of five witnesses in an attempt to reconstruct the 31-year-old musician\u2019s final hours \u2013 indicated he was alone at the time of the fall. Substances were seized from Payne\u2019s hotel room indicating alcohol and drug consumption. The former member of One Direction died on Wednesday at 5pm local time. Guests at the Casa Sur hotel told the Guardian they heard banging and shouting for hours before Payne fell. \u201cI thought they were doing construction, there was so much banging, doors slamming, most of the day. It was loud, bizarre,\u201d said Doug Jones. \u201cLater I heard the sirens, thinking perhaps there was a fire somewhere. And then I heard a very loud scream.\u201d A hotel receptionist called emergency services to notify police of an \u201caggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol\u201d, according to Reuters. The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room. Photos purporting to show Payne\u2019s room in disarray, published in local news and online, were believed to have been taken by hotel employees, sparking a backlash about journalistic ethics. Payne\u2019s family said in a statement that they were \u201cheartbroken\u201d by his death. \u201cLiam will forever live in our hearts and we\u2019ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul. We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.\u201d One Direction were formed on The X Factor in 2010. Host Dermot O\u2019Leary paid tribute to Payne, describing him as \u201ca joy\u201d who \u201chad time for everyone, [was] polite, grateful, and was always humble\u201d. Ronnie Wood \u2013 who performed with the band when they returned to guest on the show in 2014 \u2013 said it had been \u201ca pleasure to work with him\u201d, while pop star Charlie Puth, who co-wrote Payne\u2019s 2017 solo song Bedroom Floor, called him a \u201cmajor artist\u201d. Payne\u2019s former One Direction bandmates, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Niall Horan, said on Thursday evening they were \u201ccompletely devastated\u201d and will miss the singer \u201cterribly\u201d. The four said in a signed statement: \u201cIn time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly. \u201cThe memories we shared with him will be treasured for ever. For now, our thoughts are with his family, his friends, and the fans who loved him alongside us. We will miss him terribly. We love you Liam.\u201d Cheryl Tweedy, with whom Payne had a son, Bear, in 2017, has yet to comment. Rebecca Ferguson, who was the runner-up in the seventh series of The X Factor, in which One Direction placed third, and has been outspoken about abuse within the music industry, recalled meeting Payne in a taxi from Euston station to the show. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think of that boy who was hopeful and looking forward to his bright future ahead,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken for years about the exploitation and profiteering of young stars and the effects \u2013 many of us are still living with the aftermath and the PTSD. Many of us are devastated and reflective today as it has finally taken its first victim.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>EU leaders met in Brussels on Thursday with migration at the top of the agenda. Here we examine why that has happened \u2013 and what the European Commission, as well as national capitals, might do about it.</p>  <h2>Why has immigration become such a big issue again?</h2>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/10/eu-passes-asylum-and-migration-pact-after-eight-years-of-deadlock\">Only this April</a>, the EU finalised its new \u201casylum and migration pact\u201d after almost a decade of often fraught negotiations following the migration crisis of 2015 and 2016, during which almost 2 million people, mostly Syrian refugees, arrived in the bloc.</p> <p>Criticised by rights groups, the pact aims to strengthen the EU\u2019s external borders and accelerate returns of unsuccessful asylum applicants, while also spreading the financial and practical burden of resettlement more fairly among member states.</p> <p>Nonetheless, and despite irregular immigration into the EU being a fraction of what it was in 2015 (and <a href=\"https://www.frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/eu-external-borders-irregular-border-crossings-fall-nearly-40-this-year-ZXxDJD\">falling more than 35%</a> this year compared with 2023), a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/anti-immigration-mood-sweeping-eu-capitals-puts-strain-on-blocs-unity\">anti-immigration mood</a> is sweeping the bloc, driven in large part by the electoral success of far-right parties.</p> <p>Anti-immigration, far-right and national conservative parties are in power in seven EU countries, from Finland to Italy, and propping up a minority government in Sweden. The far-right Eurosceptic Freedom party topped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/victory-austria-another-step-far-right-march-europe-eu\">Austria\u2019s recent vote</a> and the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland has made historic gains in Germany.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally holds the fate of the government \u2013 whose prime minister has described current immigration levels as \u201coften insufferable\u201d \u2013 in its hands. And in Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n rails against \u201coutrageous and unacceptable\u201d EU migration policy.</p> <h2>What anti-immigration steps are national governments taking?</h2>  <p>Germany, long seen as relatively liberal on migration, has tightened its asylum laws and last month reimposed checks at all nine of its land borders, a move widely seen as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/10/the-end-of-schengen-germanys-new-border-controls-put-eu-unity-at-risk\">threatening the EU\u2019s prized principle of free movement</a> and its passport-free Schengen zone.</p> <p>It is not alone. Citing terrorist threats and overwhelmed asylum systems, seven other Schengen countries have reintroduced border controls. The Netherlands has unveiled what it calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/dutch-government-geert-wilders-pvv-brussels-opt-out-eu-asylum-rules\">\u201cthe strictest admissions rules in the EU\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Poland\u2019s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said last weekend he wanted to go further by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/human-rights-groups-urge-polish-pm-to-shelve-plan-to-suspend-right-to-asylum\">suspending the right to asylum</a> for people crossing from Belarus in an effort to cut irregular migration to \u201ca minimum\u201d and \u201cregain 100% control over who enters and leaves\u201d.</p> <p>That follows a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/28/finland-closes-entire-border-with-russia-after-tensions-over-asylum-seekers\">similar move by Finland</a> for people arriving from Russia. Warsaw and Helsinki complained that Minsk and Moscow were helping people, mainly from Africa and the Middle East, to enter the EU in a form of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://ablink.editorial.theguardian.com/ss/c/u001.Yw_JkLMEmFuifc_XG18IRyTNtZQ7fIEMgszcCSneHECxl1_zztDSLEfY7FKpaI7sT0b1GCLD9cNsurSwacV7Vw3SOQt6StWu8rZjMiSnNXBZyvHSQVj9axf3aeaYqByYxB9e4IHRHJnQ2uL4zfY5Dyvgcpc3WpQ6irbALhpy-rKQMWRcBajG2kFeNr3oHSroq0SGLEXQ-1_LkpAx0bh0dAZFZ4K4F29MsK6rpfG29YAIFHKeCMCR9-WEjGEyNhVAV8WpSAnpOH-Ec-CydCdvsXS52mwcFrUbCL7seu16IwT8JpnB6O50-3kYXaBTg0ZJ/4an/5_IOUaNXTHKm3Sm0GTDHRw/h41/h001.mBxBDPdWRfLoeqbo_Uf0bjENIUwl-IxgnGukJoCaRiw\">Italy opened two centres in Albania</a> where it will hold men trying to cross from Africa to Europe while their asylum applications are processed by Rome, a move described by the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, as a \u201ca new, courageous and unprecedented path\u201d.</p> <h2>What options are being discussed at EU level?</h2>  <p>Several ideas are on the table, none clearly defined and all needing far more discussion, but most involving some form of \u201coffshoring\u201d the problem \u2013 removing it, as far as possible, beyond the EU\u2019s borders in something reminiscent of, though not as radical as, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/22/uk-rwanda-scheme-courts-key-dates\">UK\u2019s ill-fated Rwanda scheme</a>.</p> <p>Under the Rwanda scheme, irregular immigrants would have been sent to the African country for their asylum demands to be processed \u2013 and stayed there even if successful. So far that is not being publicly discussed in the EU, but offshore processing and detention centres are.</p> <p>\u201cHotspots\u201d, \u201cmigration centres\u201d or \u201creturn hubs\u201d are all terms for facilities in third countries where asylum seekers can be held while their requests are assessed, or to which people who arrive without documentation or have had their applications rejected can be deported before being returned to their home countries.</p> <p>Also under discussion are more of the kind of \u201cpartnership deals\u201d that the EU and individual members states such as Italy have sealed with countries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/eu-deal-turkey-migrants-refugees-q-and-a\">Turkey</a>, Tunisia and Libya, which are aimed at dissuading people from trying to reach Europe in the first place.</p> <p>Fourteen member states, including France and Germany, have signed a letter demanding a tough \u201cparadigm shift\u201d on migration. Many want to see a significant increase in the \u201crate of returns\u201d: the proportion of people deported after being denied asylum, currently only about one in five.</p> <p>The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has promised action on this last point, including new legislation. She has said it is time for the bloc to look at \u201creturn hubs\u201d outside the EU, without defining how they might work or where they might be. Albania\u2019s prime minister, Edi Rama, has repeatedly said his country\u2019s deal is only for Italy.</p> <p>With countries such as Italy pushing to be able to return migrants to, for example, Syria, von der Leyen has further said that the commission is open to reviewing the EU\u2019s list of \u201cdesignated safe third countries\u201d.</p> <h2>What might be the outcome?</h2>  <p>The Polish government won support for its plan to suspend asylum for arrivals from Belarus and Russia, and leaders discussed setting up \"return hubs\" in countries outside the EU. Von der Leyen said the discussion on how to organise such hubs was still in progress.</p> <p>The summit\u2019s final statement also reflected the new mood, calling for \u201cdetermined action at all levels to facilitate, increase and speed up returns from the EU using all relevant EU policies, instruments and tools\u201d. </p> <p>It will take many more meetings, however, before the bloc arrives at a new set of common policies.

      "bodyText": "EU leaders met in Brussels on Thursday with migration at the top of the agenda. Here we examine why that has happened \u2013 and what the European Commission, as well as national capitals, might do about it. Why has immigration become such a big issue again? Only this April, the EU finalised its new \u201casylum and migration pact\u201d after almost a decade of often fraught negotiations following the migration crisis of 2015 and 2016, during which almost 2 million people, mostly Syrian refugees, arrived in the bloc. Criticised by rights groups, the pact aims to strengthen the EU\u2019s external borders and accelerate returns of unsuccessful asylum applicants, while also spreading the financial and practical burden of resettlement more fairly among member states. Nonetheless, and despite irregular immigration into the EU being a fraction of what it was in 2015 (and falling more than 35% this year compared with 2023), a new anti-immigration mood is sweeping the bloc, driven in large part by the electoral success of far-right parties. Anti-immigration, far-right and national conservative parties are in power in seven EU countries, from Finland to Italy, and propping up a minority government in Sweden. The far-right Eurosceptic Freedom party topped Austria\u2019s recent vote and the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland has made historic gains in Germany. In France, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally holds the fate of the government \u2013 whose prime minister has described current immigration levels as \u201coften insufferable\u201d \u2013 in its hands. And in Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n rails against \u201coutrageous and unacceptable\u201d EU migration policy. What anti-immigration steps are national governments taking? Germany, long seen as relatively liberal on migration, has tightened its asylum laws and last month reimposed checks at all nine of its land borders, a move widely seen as threatening the EU\u2019s prized principle of free movement and its passport-free Schengen zone. It is not alone. Citing terrorist threats and overwhelmed asylum systems, seven other Schengen countries have reintroduced border controls. The Netherlands has unveiled what it calls \u201cthe strictest admissions rules in the EU\u201d. Poland\u2019s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said last weekend he wanted to go further by suspending the right to asylum for people crossing from Belarus in an effort to cut irregular migration to \u201ca minimum\u201d and \u201cregain 100% control over who enters and leaves\u201d. That follows a similar move by Finland for people arriving from Russia. Warsaw and Helsinki complained that Minsk and Moscow were helping people, mainly from Africa and the Middle East, to enter the EU in a form of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d. Last week Italy opened two centres in Albania where it will hold men trying to cross from Africa to Europe while their asylum applications are processed by Rome, a move described by the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, as a \u201ca new, courageous and unprecedented path\u201d. What options are being discussed at EU level? Several ideas are on the table, none clearly defined and all needing far more discussion, but most involving some form of \u201coffshoring\u201d the problem \u2013 removing it, as far as possible, beyond the EU\u2019s borders in something reminiscent of, though not as radical as, the UK\u2019s ill-fated Rwanda scheme. Under the Rwanda scheme, irregular immigrants would have been sent to the African country for their asylum demands to be processed \u2013 and stayed there even if successful. So far that is not being publicly discussed in the EU, but offshore processing and detention centres are. \u201cHotspots\u201d, \u201cmigration centres\u201d or \u201creturn hubs\u201d are all terms for facilities in third countries where asylum seekers can be held while their requests are assessed, or to which people who arrive without documentation or have had their applications rejected can be deported before being returned to their home countries. Also under discussion are more of the kind of \u201cpartnership deals\u201d that the EU and individual members states such as Italy have sealed with countries such as Turkey, Tunisia and Libya, which are aimed at dissuading people from trying to reach Europe in the first place. Fourteen member states, including France and Germany, have signed a letter demanding a tough \u201cparadigm shift\u201d on migration. Many want to see a significant increase in the \u201crate of returns\u201d: the proportion of people deported after being denied asylum, currently only about one in five. The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has promised action on this last point, including new legislation. She has said it is time for the bloc to look at \u201creturn hubs\u201d outside the EU, without defining how they might work or where they might be. Albania\u2019s prime minister, Edi Rama, has repeatedly said his country\u2019s deal is only for Italy. With countries such as Italy pushing to be able to return migrants to, for example, Syria, von der Leyen has further said that the commission is open to reviewing the EU\u2019s list of \u201cdesignated safe third countries\u201d. What might be the outcome? The Polish government won support for its plan to suspend asylum for arrivals from Belarus and Russia, and leaders discussed setting up \"return hubs\" in countries outside the EU. Von der Leyen said the discussion on how to organise such hubs was still in progress. The summit\u2019s final statement also reflected the new mood, calling for \u201cdetermined action at all levels to facilitate, increase and speed up returns from the EU using all relevant EU policies, instruments and tools\u201d. It will take many more meetings, however, before the bloc arrives at a new set of common policies. In the meantime, national governments will continue to take unilateral measures (according to Dutch media, the Netherlands would like to deport people to Uganda). Although the talks were reportedly constructive, the pact on migration and asylum, due to take effect over the next two years, has already been weakened. Many now accept it is not tough enough on deportation, and the Netherlands and Hungary are demanding opt-outs. There are major doubts about the feasibility and legality of the proposed new measures. External partnership deals, under which countries such as Tunisia and Libya are paid to contain and return irregular migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, have already been heavily criticised by NGOs after revelations of serious human rights abuses there. \u201cHotspots\u201d and \u201creturn hubs\u201d are equally controversial, with activists and researchers questioning whether, compared with a well-funded, EU-based asylum system, they can ever be humane, effective or even legal under international law. Four of the first 16 migrants Italy sent to Albania were sent back because they were minors or were deemed vulnerable. More practically, besides Albania\u2019s deal with Italy and a small-scale agreement between Denmark and Kosovo, it is unclear which non-EU might be willing to host such centres. Some diplomats suspect that for this reason alone, the idea may be a non-starter.",

Late on Thursday, an unsealed US indictment named Vikash Yadav as the Indian spy US prosecutors believe attempted to orchestrate the assassination of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US citizen, in New York. Pannun, a lawyer and activist, is a known firebrand leader of the Khalistan movement which fights for an independent state for Sikhs in Punjab, and which is banned in India. Pannun had been designated a terrorist by the Indian government. Pannun called the plot to kill him a \u201cblatant case of India\u2019s transnational terrorism which has become a challenge to America\u2019s sovereignty and threat to freedom of speech and democracy\u201d.

      "body": "<p>There is something very Eddy and Patsy about Absolutely Fabulous getting an in-depth, bells-and-whistles retrospective, not for its 25th or even 30th anniversaries, but for its \u2026 32nd. Absolutely Fabulous: Inside Out is an indulgent treat for fans, bulging out of its Lacroix sample sizes with gossip, memories, outtakes and a warm, if too brief, cast reunion. If, like many of the talking heads here, you believe it to be one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time \u2013 and it is, obviously, particularly the first three series \u2013 then this is a fantastic and revelatory deep dive into who and what made it so special.</p> <p>As regular listeners of the French and Saunders podcast Titting About will know, Dawn French took some time away from their double act in the early 1990s to raise her daughter, leaving Jennifer Saunders without her comedy partner and in need of a new project. Saunders admits that at that point, her writing experience had been limited to sketches. But one of those sketches, Modern Mother and Daughter, saw French playing a Saffy character, and Saunders the mother, then called Adriana. You can see how much of the show is there already. It only needed the addition of best friend and fashion editor Patsy \u2013 whom Joanna Lumley poetically refers to as a \u201csuccubus \u2026 like ivy, or one of those insects that feed off you\u201d \u2013 to flesh it out. If a single sketch could be nine minutes long, Saunders reasons, you only needed to put two of them together to call it a sitcom.</p>    <p>There\u2019s a lovely against-the-odds narrative throughout. Saunders\u2019 approach to writing Ab Fab appears to have been, shall we say, scattergun, and that was on a good day. The first series was largely written in advance, but later episodes would be worked out in the rehearsal room, with a lot of cigarettes (\u201cWe liked all the smoking,\u201d says Lumley). Ruby Wax, who script edited, remembers one script that, in lieu of a written scene, simply said \u201csomething funny happens\u201d. To Saunders\u2019 credit, it did. It was so slapdash that Lumley admits she asked her agent to try to get her out of playing Patsy, who said that she should film the pilot anyway, and that it probably wouldn\u2019t take off. Producer Jon Plowman remembers former head of comedy at the BBC, Robin Nash, sitting through the dress rehearsal for the pilot and noting afterwards that he never had found women being drunk very funny.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2lckLWoQcw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e2lckLWoQcw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Absolutely Fabulous: Inside Out trailer \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But plenty of viewers did, and it was a smash hit: the sort of crowd-pleasing comedy, as the director Emerald Fennell says, that only comes along once every decade. To watch it now, for the hundredth time, is to be reminded of how fantastically anarchic it is.

      "bodyText": "There is something very Eddy and Patsy about Absolutely Fabulous getting an in-depth, bells-and-whistles retrospective, not for its 25th or even 30th anniversaries, but for its \u2026 32nd. Absolutely Fabulous: Inside Out is an indulgent treat for fans, bulging out of its Lacroix sample sizes with gossip, memories, outtakes and a warm, if too brief, cast reunion. If, like many of the talking heads here, you believe it to be one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time \u2013 and it is, obviously, particularly the first three series \u2013 then this is a fantastic and revelatory deep dive into who and what made it so special. As regular listeners of the French and Saunders podcast Titting About will know, Dawn French took some time away from their double act in the early 1990s to raise her daughter, leaving Jennifer Saunders without her comedy partner and in need of a new project. Saunders admits that at that point, her writing experience had been limited to sketches. But one of those sketches, Modern Mother and Daughter, saw French playing a Saffy character, and Saunders the mother, then called Adriana. You can see how much of the show is there already. It only needed the addition of best friend and fashion editor Patsy \u2013 whom Joanna Lumley poetically refers to as a \u201csuccubus \u2026 like ivy, or one of those insects that feed off you\u201d \u2013 to flesh it out. If a single sketch could be nine minutes long, Saunders reasons, you only needed to put two of them together to call it a sitcom. There\u2019s a lovely against-the-odds narrative throughout. Saunders\u2019 approach to writing Ab Fab appears to have been, shall we say, scattergun, and that was on a good day. The first series was largely written in advance, but later episodes would be worked out in the rehearsal room, with a lot of cigarettes (\u201cWe liked all the smoking,\u201d says Lumley). Ruby Wax, who script edited, remembers one script that, in lieu of a written scene, simply said \u201csomething funny happens\u201d. To Saunders\u2019 credit, it did. It was so slapdash that Lumley admits she asked her agent to try to get her out of playing Patsy, who said that she should film the pilot anyway, and that it probably wouldn\u2019t take off. Producer Jon Plowman remembers former head of comedy at the BBC, Robin Nash, sitting through the dress rehearsal for the pilot and noting afterwards that he never had found women being drunk very funny. But plenty of viewers did, and it was a smash hit: the sort of crowd-pleasing comedy, as the director Emerald Fennell says, that only comes along once every decade. To watch it now, for the hundredth time, is to be reminded of how fantastically anarchic it is. The jokes still have fangs, and, to its credit, this doesn\u2019t retrospectively clutch its pearls at some of the more outrageous ones: Patsy telling Saffy that she should have been aborted remains one of its most quotable and most vicious moments. Lumley says she asked if she really had to say the line, and Saunders, of course, insisted she did. This is a timely reminder, too, that as Patsy, Lumley puts in one of the greatest physical comedy turns in TV history, and she still doesn\u2019t get nearly enough credit for how perfect a performance it is. Patsy simply eating is so funny that the cast can\u2019t even talk about it now without cracking up.

Red Bull have come to an agreement with the FIA regarding their use of the system, which is believed to alter the ride height of the \u201ctea tray\u201d section which sits at the front of the car\u2019s floor.

      "bodyText": "Lando Norris has welcomed the FIA clamping down on a potentially illegal device on his world championship rival Max Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull after the governing body deemed it could be used against the regulations to improve performance. The McLaren driver was speaking before this weekend\u2019s US Grand Prix as he prepares to go into a decisive showdown with Verstappen for the title over the remaining six races. Norris is 52 points behind with 180 still available across the next six meetings. Before running began on Friday the FIA issued a clarification that the device, believed to be used to adjust the car\u2019s ride height between qualifying and races, when such adjustments are not permitted, could not be employed. Red Bull have come to an agreement with the FIA regarding their use of the system, which is believed to alter the ride height of the \u201ctea tray\u201d section which sits at the front of the car\u2019s floor. Running a high height in the race over qualifying is considered an advantage. \u201cIt\u2019s good that the FIA are doing such a thing,\u201d Norris said. \u201cThere is a difference between black and white stuff like this and pushing the boundaries and creating new things and innovating within the space you are allowed to innovate, and that is what we as McLaren have done a very good job in, but we are sure not to go any further than that.\u201d Norris played down the impact the use of the device may have had but in a tightly fought championship acknowledged it could yet make a difference. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing having it on your car and another on how much you exploit it and use it, which we have no idea on,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it has been helping them and they have been utilising it in a way people think they have then maybe it will shift in our direction.\u201d In the buildup to this weekend\u2019s race the FIA also announced it is to cease awarding a bonus point for the fastest lap from next season, removing the rule introduced in 2019.

God may not end up saving the Lewis family\u2019s souls, but he might just have saved the sitcom. \u2022 Everyone Else Burns is on Channel 4 now in the UK and SBS in Australia.",

      "bodyText": "Thank you so much for joining me for this match this evening, Chelsea are yet to do anything but win in all competitions so far this season and they keep the ball rolling with a 3-1 result against Twente. Read the report below for all the action. We\u2019ll be back with Women\u2019s Champions League action on 12 November and we will be across the WSL this weekend. See you soon. https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/17/twente-chelsea-womens-champions-league-match-report In the other 8pm BST kick-off, Lyon have made a statement with a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg. Wendie Renard and Lindsey Horan scored in a great win for the European giants. A fun fact for you, the penalty for Guro Reiten tonight was her 50th goal for Chelsea. Ravensbergen had a chance right at the end there, I think she has done enough to win a starting shirt next time out. Chelsea\u2019s winning start to the season continues with goals from Aggie Beever-Jones, Maika Hamano and a penalty from Guro Reiten sees them top the group. Twente, who are in the group stage for the first time, had a good performance and they will fancy their chances of getting out of this group. The top two teams will progress and Twente are currently level on points with Real Madrid, Celtic are bottom. 90 + 3 min: Ramirez is found and she looked offside but it takes a while for the official to raise the flag, just before she was going to pull a trigger on her shot the whistle is blown. 90 + 2 min: Beever-Jones makes a good run into the box but she decides to keep a hold of the ball instead of laying it off to Ramirez and she is crowded out. The wrong option there from the England international. 90 + 1 min: There will be four minutes added. 90 min: Here Chelsea come, can they find a fourth? No they can\u2019t as Twente clear it and try to counter which doesn\u2019t quite come together. 88 min: Chelsea pass it back to Musovic multiple times but they then lose it in a dangerous position. Ivens, again, is all over the visitors but Mpome dispossess her. 86 min: Twente make another change with Te Braeke off for Proost. Chelsea really winding down the clock now, some good game management. 84 min: Possession is exchanging hands quite frequently now with Twente the next with an impressive play. Ivens, who is just 16-years-old, makes a phenomenal run to beat two Chelsea players but her resulting cross is cleared. 82 min: Beever-Jones wanted a free kick there but it isn\u2019t given. Cuthbert wins it back in the midfield though as Chelsea continue to soak up pressure to see this victory out. 80 min: Twente make another change with Andradottir off for Ravensbergen. 79 min: A lovely bit of play between Beever-Jones and Ramirez but the Colombian\u2019s resulting cross is cut out and Twente look to counter. They can\u2019t move it quickly and so their attack stalls, eventually Chelsea manage to wrestle it back and clear. 77 min: Chelsea had faded slightly after conceding but they are slowly building back their dominance of possession, the game is basically sewn up now anyway. But who knows, if Twente score next anything could happen. 75 min: Twente have come alive since scoring, they look much more confident with the front foot. If they started the game like this who knows what the score would be. The hosts make a double change with Van Dooren and Peddermors off for Ivens and Holst. 73 min: Peter Chapman has emailed and said: Guro Reiten is such a reliable penalty taker. I completely agree, Peter. You can see why she is the chosen taker for the club. 72 min: Cuthbert has a looping ball back and it is almost a howler from the Scotland international but Bjorn manages to clear. Some sloppiness coming into Chelsea\u2019s game. 70 min: Bartel is on for her first minutes for Chelsea, she comes on for Kaptein. 69 min: Twente did deserve something from this match after their efforts and Van Dijk put in a the perfect run to receive the ball and slot it passed Musovic. A great goal. 67 min: Chelsea are firmly in the driving seat now but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t taking their eye off the wheel in certain moments. Twente have certainly had their chances and if they had taken them, while I don\u2019t think they would be ahead, they definitely would have landed a few punches. 65 min: Reiten came on just after half-time by the way, apologies for not slotting in that update. Twente are looking to immediately strike back with Van Dooren taking a shot but Musovic saves. Reiten is booed before she takes it but she composes herself, takes a run up and scores. 62 min: Penalty for Chelsea after Ramirez is fouled in the box! Just a moment after Twente had a chance. 60 min: There are so many good things about this Twente side but their lack of connectivity and communication has really let them down. Chelsea make changes with Jean-Francois off for Cuthbert and Kaneryd is off for Ramirez. 58 min: It is end-to-end here as Chelsea come forward again, Kaneryd crosses but Clark gets there first. 56 min: Peddermors sets a light for Twente but her cross has too much on it and the chance is gone, Twente are really posing a threat at times and it\u2019s clear to see how they beat Celtic last week. Their match again Real Madrid will be an interesting watch. 54 min: Hamano is having a game so far, she gets in a great position and lines it up but it is just wide. She is a live wire so far, really putting her hand up for more game time. 52 min: Twente are getting chances in this encounter, they just can\u2019t seem to turn it home, the ball this time peeled back to Van Dooren but Musovic saves quite easily. 50 min: Dave has got in touch and asked for an update on Lauren James, who was a late change in the starting team. He wonders if there\u2019s trouble in camp with James but I do not think that is the case at all. Such a late change will be something like injury or illness. Chelsea have not confirmed what happened as of yet. 49 min: Twente really need to be the next to score in this match but they just can\u2019t seem to get a foothold at the moment. 47 min: Chelsea start the half just as the did the first with upbeat energy. So can Twente stage a huge comeback? Or will Chelsea top the group after two games? All to come. Beever-Jones remains. Two games have already taken place today with Real Madrid beating Celtic 4-0 and Galatasaray losing 6-1 to Roma. In the other 8pm BST kick-off, Lyon lead Wolfsburg after a header by Wendie Renard. Here are the goals from the game so far: Beever-Jones does not look comfortable, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she is changed at half-time. The corner comes to nothing and we\u2019ve reached the break of a enthralling half. Chelsea are in cruise control and on their way to the top of their group after goals from Aggie Beever-Jones and Maika Hamano. I will grab clips of both goals to show you momentarily. 45 + 1 min: There will be one minute added and Chelsea have a corner. 44 min: It ends in a goal kick but this has certainly been 90% Chelsea so far. 43 min: Perisset drifts the ball across goal but no one is there to turn it in and so Clark can collect. Twente decide to play from the back which backfires as they send it into the stands to give the Blues another platform. 41 min: It is quite scary to think of the players Chelsea could bring on in the second half: Millie Bright, Lucy Bronze, Guro Reiten. So far they don\u2019t need them with the star-filled starting XI doing just fine on their own. 39 min: Quite the pun from Peter on email: Question about leadership potential. Is Chelsea\u2019s Wieke Kaptein material? You joke but I could see it! 37 min: I think one of them is reading my blog because since my last post Twente have retained possession and played some slick football. They are just missing the final pass to create a chance. 35 min: Chelsea keep knocking on the door and the latest chance comes from Kaneryd but Clark collects. While Twente have not been really poor, they need more of the ball. They\u2019ve only really had one convincing chance so far. 33 min: Tuin reads a Chelsea pass well to thwart their latest chance but then Andradottir fouls Buchanan and so the Blues have a chance to strike again. 31 min: Chelsea have taken some of the speed out of this game as they patiently build-up to their latest attempt. It comes to Baltimore down the left who has her cross blocked. 29 min: Chelsea have a corner and the delivery is a good one, it comes to Beever-Jones but her header is over the bar. It doesn\u2019t feel like we have had a moment to breathe in this encounter yet. It\u2019s all go, go, go. Hamano the standout player so far. 27 min: Musovic is forced into a save after Van Dijk pounces on a Chelsea defensive error, the Blues not well drilled. It went out for a corner, the cross is a good one but Carleer can\u2019t steer it on target. 25 min: Chelsea do an awful job of clearing the ball in the box, it takes several attempts to clear the danger and despite the scoreline Twente feel bang up for this. The hosts get in a great position once again and Peddermors takes an effort but it is over the bar. 23 min: Perisset, who is starting a match for the first time this season, pops a cross in but Clark collects. The camera then pans to Beever-Jones who is hobbling slightly but there is no hint of her being subbed. 21 min: This game is giving me the same feeling as when I try to pat my head and rub my stomach, too much happening all at once. Twente have their first chance in their half and Bjorn clears before it can reach Van Dijk. 19 min: Hamano spotted Clark off of her line and takes a long range effort and there was nothing the keeper could do. An absolute screamer, sumptuous yet frantic football from the visitors. Oh my word. 17 min: Chelsea work it into the box and it comes to Hamano, she takes a touch and pulls the trigger but it is just over the bar. The Blues are not relenting and they are there again. Beever-Jones takes a punt but Hamano\u2019s header is over the bar. A nice side note, Sarina Wiegman is in the crowd for this one. 15 min: It has been slightly frantic from both sides since the goal. Chelsea haven\u2019t taken the game by the scruff of the neck with a stop start nature to the encounter so far. 13 min: Kaneryd has a great run and crosses perfectly to Beever-Jones but her effort is way over the bar. That attempt felt slightly rushed when she could have taken her time there. 11 min: Joe Pearson has emailed and said: You\u2019re my only eyes on this match, as I can\u2019t get into DAZN for some reason. No pressure. As for snacks, well it\u2019s mid-afternoon here, so all I have is a nice glass of Chardonnay. But I did have a pretty good Thai papaya salad for lunch a while back. I take the pressure in my stride and I love the sound of your snacks. Just a tip about DAZN, you may have to download the app to watch if you are on your phone. Back to the action and Chelsea are really dominating since scoring. 9 min: It is James who is not playing for Chelsea tonight now with Kaneryd on the pitch. No official news yet but as soon as I hear any I will keep you updated. 8 min: I am unsure if that will go down as a Beever-Jones goal or an own goal as it did take a big deflection. But I think that was commentators curse, I said Twente was going well and then they concede. A deflected screamer. 6 min: Gordon has got in touch and shared his snack chat: Just saw your \u201cshout out\u201d about snacks - as an older person, under doctor\u2019s orders to lose weight, I\u2019m afraid my snack these days is baby carrots - but they are slightly sweet in taste. Baby carrots are an amazing snack, might take that for the next game I watch. Back to the game and the hosts are really well drilled defensively so far. 4 min: Carleer does some good early defensive work as the visitors look to strike early. Chelsea aren\u2019t fading rom this attack though but Beever-Jones\u2019 pass is intercepted and cleared. I am so confused about the Chelsea team, the one they announced on social channels is different to the one they have fielded and gave WCL organisers. No injury news to report. 2 min: There has been no official announcement on Chelsea\u2019s channels at the moment, I will keep my eye out but Kaneryd is definitely on the pitch. Here we go then. It looks like Chelsea have made a late change as Kaneryd is on the pitch. I will investigate and see who that was for. The players will be out on the pitch shortly before kick-off at 8pm BST. Can Chelsea keep their winning momentum going? Or can Twente cause an upset? All to come. I\u2019d love to hear from you and I particularly love a bit of snack chat. Let me know what you are treating yourself to while watching the game. For me tonight it\u2019s salted popcorn. You can get in touch via email or X (@rendellx). An interesting watch: Twente coach Joran Pot said before the game: \u201cWe are the underdogs, it\u2019s as simple as that, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a chance. We\u2019re excited to have an opponent of this calibre \u2013 it shows that we\u2019re making great strides. If we play to our potential, we can make it difficult for Chelsea. It\u2019s about executing the small things we\u2019ve discussed well.\u201d Chelsea defender Kadeisha Buchanan said: \u201cThe past few seasons have been challenging, but I\u2019m improving on and off the pitch. This might be my best season yet, but I know there\u2019s more to come. It\u2019s great to have [former Lyon team-mate] Lucy [Bronze] back [in England]. We\u2019ve both grown as players, and our partnership feels strong. Communication has been key as we adapt to the new coach and style.\u201d Catarina Macario will not be a part of Chelsea\u2019s squad in today\u2019s match as she continues to build fitness. Macario suffered a knee irritation in the summer. Manager Sonia Bompastor said: \u201cWe are building some minutes and building her fitness. That\u2019s part of the plan and part of her own process. We work a lot individually with every player and we try to give them what they need to be fit and back to the best level, or their best version. We just felt it was the good decision to have her stay in London, working individually with some staff, and she will be ready for the game on Sunday.\u201d Two other English clubs were in action in the Women\u2019s Champions League last night and they both came away with wins. Arsenal beat V\u00e5lerenga 4-1, while Manchester City escaped a scare in their 3-2 win over St Polten. You can read both reports: The team news is in. Twente have named a strong side including their captain Danique van Ginkel. Twente: Clark, Vliek, Carleer, Knol, Tuin, Te Braeke, Van Dooren, Van Ginkel, Andradottir, Van Dijk, Peddemors. Subs: De Jong, Bussman, Vissers, Evaraerts, Bormans, Hulst, Ravensbergen, Proost, Oude Elberink, Verdaasdonk, Galic, Ivens. Chelsea, meanwhile, have benched several stars including Millie Bright and Lucy Bronze. Chelsea: Musovic, Perisset, Buchanan, Bjorn, Lawrence, Kaptein, Jean-Francois, Baltimore, Hamano, James, Beever-Jones. Subs: Cox, Hampton, Bright, Nusken, Ramirez, Cuthbert, Reiten, Bartel, Kaneryd, Bronze, Mpome. Hello and welcome back to the Women\u2019s Champions League group stage. Tonight we will be focusing on Twente\u2019s match against Chelsea. The European trophy is the one which has evaded the Blues throughout their history and they will be hoping they can claim it this season. Chelsea have had a good start to their season and head into this game off the back of a win over rivals Arsenal in the Women\u2019s Super League. They also started their Champions League campaign with a 3-2 win over Real Madrid last week. Twente, meanwhile, drew 1-1 at the weekend against Excelsior in the Eredivisie and came away with a win against Celtic in their opening Champions League group stage match. Both clubs will want to keep their winning momentum going in the competition. Team news will drop soon so stay tuned before kick-off at 8pm BST.",

      "body": "<p>Alvin Rakoff, who has died aged 97, left his native Canada in the early 1950s to become a prolific director of television plays in Britain, helping to pioneer small-screen drama during its formative years.</p> <p>Single plays were his preferred format \u2013 he made dozens \u2013 and his legacy is best demonstrated in A Voyage Round My Father, a 1982 Emmy award-winning production of the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/16/mortimer-rumpole-dies-obituary\">John Mortimer</a>\u2019s autobiographical drama. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/olivier\">Laurence Olivier</a> played the cantankerous, eccentric, blind father in declining health, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/29/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Alan Bates</a> as the devoted son who followed him into law while harbouring ambitions as a writer. Rakoff directed much of the leisurely action between them in the large garden of Mortimer\u2019s Buckinghamshire home \u2013 capturing the special bond between father and son while dealing sensitively with Olivier\u2019s own failing health and difficulty in remembering lines.</p> <p>He was adept at coaxing the best out of actors and dealing with their emotions.

      "bodyText": "Alvin Rakoff, who has died aged 97, left his native Canada in the early 1950s to become a prolific director of television plays in Britain, helping to pioneer small-screen drama during its formative years. Single plays were his preferred format \u2013 he made dozens \u2013 and his legacy is best demonstrated in A Voyage Round My Father, a 1982 Emmy award-winning production of the writer John Mortimer\u2019s autobiographical drama. Laurence Olivier played the cantankerous, eccentric, blind father in declining health, with Alan Bates as the devoted son who followed him into law while harbouring ambitions as a writer. Rakoff directed much of the leisurely action between them in the large garden of Mortimer\u2019s Buckinghamshire home \u2013 capturing the special bond between father and son while dealing sensitively with Olivier\u2019s own failing health and difficulty in remembering lines. He was adept at coaxing the best out of actors and dealing with their emotions. When Michael Crawford made an early television appearance in the play The Move After Checkmate (1966), Rakoff needed to re-shoot a long scene for technical reasons. The actor was adamant he could not repeat it because he felt he had given his best performance, but Rakoff persuaded him to do another take. \u201cAs we finished the scene, Michael\u2019s whole body sagged,\u201d the director told me. \u201cIt was awful, terrible. He was just upset and near to tears.\u201d Rakoff took Crawford to the director\u2019s gallery, played him both takes and allowed the actor to choose the best. \u201cThe second one is miles better,\u201d admitted Crawford. \u201cI hope you have learned something from this,\u201d Rakoff told him. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for you to judge for yourself \u2013 you must rely on other people.\u201d However, Rakoff had to admit defeat in one of his forays into feature films. Bette Davis, cast as the bitter matriarch of the Taggart family in the 1968 screen version of Bill MacIlwraith\u2019s stage play The Anniversary, had a power of veto over the director. She did little to gain friends among fellow cast members, then on the first day of filming complained about Rakoff\u2019s \u201ctelevision techniques\u201d of \u201cblocking\u201d and \u201cmarking\u201d his actors\u2019 moves.

When Michael Caine wrote what Rakoff described as \u201cbegging letters\u201d after taking a tiny part in Requiem for a Heavyweight, the director put him in army boots shot in close-up with titles superimposed over them for The Dark Side of the Earth (1959), a drama about the Hungarian revolution. Born in Toronto, Alvin was the third of seven children of Pearl (nee Isenberg), who came from Rivne in Ukraine, and Samuel Rakoff, a shopkeeper from Voronezh in Russia.

After the Blues had won possession inside the opposition half, the Japan international spotted Clark off her line, lofted the ball goalwards and it swept down and in over the keeper.</p> \n<p>Twente manager, Joran Pot, had said prior to kick-off: \u201cWe are the underdogs, it\u2019s as simple as that, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5015f405-f003-4bd5-b658-f0bfe1eb049a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Celtic were taken apart in the Women\u2019s Champions League as they lost 4-0 away to Real Madrid.

It was deserved, the 21-year-old showing the breadth of her skillset with the long-range effort in front of Sarina Wiegman, who has named the forward in her squad for England\u2019s two October friendlies and was in the stands in her home nation. Beever-Jones and Hamano were at the heart of Chelsea\u2019s forward play, the former sending an acrobatic overhead kick into the empty stand behind the Twente goal and the latter collecting from Ashley Lawrence before twisting free of Danique van Ginkel and firing over. Hamano made no mistake for Chelsea\u2019s second. After the Blues had won possession inside the opposition half, the Japan international spotted Clark off her line, lofted the ball goalwards and it swept down and in over the keeper. Twente manager, Joran Pot, had said prior to kick-off: \u201cWe are the underdogs, it\u2019s as simple as that, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d The home team lived up to the underdog mantle, but they did have chances. Allowing teams to get a foothold back in games they have dominated has been a feature of Chelsea performances under Bompastor to date and in the Netherlands it was no exception. The home team were let down by their inferior technical quality, though, the final ball missing from some promising breaks, allowing Chelsea to comfortably escape any embarrassment. Twente\u2019s small period of pressure that had lifted the crowd was cut short when Chelsea recovered from a break and Beever-Jones fed substitute Ram\u00edrez, who was scythed down by Lieske Carleer in the box. Fellow substitute Reiten coolly converted the spot kick to extend the lead of the visiting side. There would be some joy for the home team though, with Nik\u00e9e Dian\u00e1 Van Dijk latching on to a ball over the top five minutes later and outpacing Nathalie Bj\u00f6rn, before slotting past Zecira Musovic, the home fans\u2019 celebrations wild and loud. There were some more bright moments for the Dutch side, but this was never going to be a big test for Chelsea. Another win, another learning opportunity and another chance to have a look at the defensive lapses that could prove more costly later in the competition.",

I am an engineer. But I cannot fix it without your help, that is why I\u2019m asking for your support today. Together, we can do this. Together, we can fix the system that is broken. Together, we can renew.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Badenoch said Nigel Farage speaks with \u201cclarity\u201d and \u201cconviction\u201d.</strong> She told the GB News Tory leadership debate: \u201cNigel Farage speaks with clarity, he speaks with conviction. When people hear him speak, they believe that he understands their concerns. For a long time, when we were speaking, people just heard this technocratic, managerialist language that didn\u2019t mean very much to people. It was all policy and no principles, that is why I keep emphasising principles.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Meanwhile, Jenrick claimed the government had relinquished sovereignty of the Chagos Islands \u201cso that David Lammy can feel better when he goes to a dinner party in north London\u201d.</strong> The Tory leadership hopeful told the GB News debate: \u201cDavid Lammy and Keir Starmer have just handed sovereign British territory with a critical military base on it to a close ally of China. Why? So that David Lammy can feel better when he goes to a dinner party in north London. Whose interests does he think he serves?\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Jenrick said he would cap migration in \u201cthe tens of thousands or lower\u201d if he were in charge.</strong> Asked to put a number on his pledge to cap the number of people entering the UK, he said: \u201cI would do the tens of thousands or lower. The most important point is we\u2019ve got to get parliament to do this so we can look the public in the eye this time and say it\u2019s actually going to happen.\u201d He denied he was just making hardline remarks on immigration to win over Tory members.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Jenrick claimed he had argued against the depletion of the armed forces while he served as a minister in the previous Tory government.</strong> He said: \u201cBecause I\u2019m a fiscal Conservative, the easiest thing in the world would be to say you today, let\u2019s spend more money on the armed forces without saying how are we going to get this money. I don\u2019t want taxes to rise, I don\u2019t want the state to get bigger, so I\u2019ve said let\u2019s take that money from our international aid budget and let\u2019s spend it on our armed forces. That is the best way.\u201d</p></li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all from me, Tom Ambrose, for tonight.

The letter was sent on 20 September, but was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-social-fund-winter-fuel-payments-regulations-2024/the-social-fund-winter-fuel-payments-regulations-2024-letter-to-the-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions\">only published today.</a></p> <p>In the letter Stephen Brien, the committee\u2019s chair, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We were disappointed that an assessment of impact was not presented to the committee alongside the regulations on 11 September 2024. It has subsequently been confirmed that a full assessment of impact does not exist, with the prime minister commenting that it was not legally necessary and that \u201cThe impact will be mitigated by pension credit, by the housing benefit\u201d<sup>.</sup></p> <p>Given the scale of pensioners who will be affected by this change, and the speed at which it is being introduced, we are not similarly reassured that this will be the case and are of the firm view that a more detailed assessment is urgently required, in particular, on the potential poverty impact.</p> </blockquote> <p>The committee makes various other recommendations, including saying people on full pensioner housing benefit should also continue to get the winter fuel payment, and demanding an assurance that enough staff are available to process new pension crediti claims.</p> <p>That is all from me for today.

She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unless we address our remand population, we could still see a collapse of the system, not because of a lack of cells, but because we do not have those cells in the places that we need them. It is therefore crucial that we bear down on the remand population.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mahmood said magistrates currently only have the power to sentence people to up to six months in jail. She said the last government, between May 2022 and March 2023, allowed magistrates to sentence people to up to 12 months, and this meant magistrates could hear more cases, and those cases got dealt with more quickly.</p> <p>But the last government went back to six months when pressure on prison places became too great, she said. </p> <p>Mahmood told MPs, that because of early release measures taken by Labour to reduce overcrowding, she was now reverting to giving magistrates the power to sentence people for up to 12 months. The change will come into force on 18 November, she said.</p> <p>Explaining how this would help the criminal justice system, she went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This government inherited a record crown court backlog. Waits for trials have grown so long that some cases are not heard for years. </p> <p>The impact on victims of crime is profound. For some justice delayed is, as the old saying goes, justice denied as victims choose to withdraw from the justice process altogether rather than face the pain of a protracted legal battle.</p> <p>By extending magistrates\u2019 powers, we will be able to make progress on addressing the crown court backlog, and we will free the crown court to take on more of the cases that only they can hear. </p> <p>This measure is expected to free up an equivalent of 2,000 sitting days within the crown court each year, which will add capacity on top of the additional 500 sitting days that this government funded on taking office.</p> <p>This measure will, in total, see a slight increase in the overall prison population, but by bearing down on the remand population of our reception prisons, we will create capacity where we need it most. This measure allows us to manage our prison population smartly, and it means we can both address our prisons crisis and tackled the courts\u2019 backlog.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-17T11:22:12.632Z\">at 12.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6710ec5b8f086069213bb624\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-17T11:00:57.799Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Foreign Office announces fresh sanctions against Russian oil tankers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Foreign Office has announced a fresh round of sanctions against Russian oil tankers and liquified gas tankers.

In his write-up, <strong>Charles Hymas</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Jenrick, the former immigration minister, would win 50 extra seats if he was leader of the Tories compared with 30 seats that would be gained if <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/WwLy7/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/10/15/kemi-badenoch-tory-leadership-contest-interview/\">Kemi Badenoch</a>, his <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/WwLy7/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/next-conservative-leader-odds/\">rival for the top job</a>, was in charge of the party, according to the poll of nearly 6,300 people by Electoral Calculus \u2026</p> <p>Under Mr Jenrick, the Conservatives would increase their number of seats from 121 to 178, with Labour falling from 412 to 311, the <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/WwLy7/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/09/14/sweary-lib-dems-conference-brexit-song-vulgar-farage/\">Liberal Democrats</a> dropping from 72 to 58 and Reform rising from five to 24. That would place Labour 14 seats short of a majority.</p> <p>Under Mrs Badenoch, the Conservatives would increase their number of seats from 121 to 151, while Labour would fall from 412 to 332, the Lib Dems would dip from 72 to 63 and Reform rise from five to 25. That would see Labour in government with a 14-seat majority.</p> </blockquote>    <p>This is interesting, but only up to a point, for two reasons. First, the performance gap between Jenrick and Badenoch, according to these figures, and in truth no one can be sure who would be best for the Tories because voters don\u2019t know a huge amount about either of them, and it is impossible to know for sure how they would perform as leaders. And, second, Conservative members aren\u2019t always very interested in picking the candidate most popular with the electorate at large (which is partly why things started going wrong for them).</p> <p>I will post more on the Tories as the day goes on. Apart from the GB News hustings, the diary is relatively light today, but there is still a lot of talk about the budget. As <strong>Eleni Courea</strong> reports, some cabinet ministers have been writing to Keir Starmer complaining about the cuts they are being asked to implement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/16/rachel-reeves-tax-rises-spending-cuts-budget\">Cabinet ministers contest chancellor\u2019s planned cuts to their departments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> John Healey, the defence secretary, attends a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> The Office for National Statistics publishes figures on the disability pay gap.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> The Department for Education publishes figures on pupil absences in England.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Lucy Powell, leader of the Commons, takes questions on next week\u2019s Commons business.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>7pm</em>: Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick take part in a leadership hustings on GB News.

      "bodyText": "You can read our report on the debate by our senior political correspondent Peter Walker here Conservative leadership candidates Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick took part in a GB News special tonight, setting out their vision for the Tory party. Moderated by Christopher Hope, the candidates covered subjects including immigration, culture wars and the European Court of Human Rights. Badenoch hit back at a Tory MP\u2019s suggestion that she could not lead the party because she was too \u201cpreoccupied\u201d with her children, saying \u201cit isn\u2019t always women who have parental responsibilities\u201d. The Conservative leadership candidate was asked about the remarks made by Christopher Chope earlier on Thursday. Asked about the bullying allegations first published by the Guardian, she said \u201cof course they run to the Guardian to tell lies about me\u201d. It\u2019s because she got the bad people out of her department, she says. Badenoch said she is an \u201cengineer\u201d who can fix the \u201cbroken system\u201d and renew the Tory party. In her pitch to members, the leadership hopeful told the GB News debate: \u201cThis broken system is going to need an engineer to fix it. I am an engineer. But I cannot fix it without your help, that is why I\u2019m asking for your support today. Together, we can do this. Together, we can fix the system that is broken. Together, we can renew.\u201d Badenoch said Nigel Farage speaks with \u201cclarity\u201d and \u201cconviction\u201d. She told the GB News Tory leadership debate: \u201cNigel Farage speaks with clarity, he speaks with conviction. When people hear him speak, they believe that he understands their concerns. For a long time, when we were speaking, people just heard this technocratic, managerialist language that didn\u2019t mean very much to people. It was all policy and no principles, that is why I keep emphasising principles.\u201d Meanwhile, Jenrick claimed the government had relinquished sovereignty of the Chagos Islands \u201cso that David Lammy can feel better when he goes to a dinner party in north London\u201d. The Tory leadership hopeful told the GB News debate: \u201cDavid Lammy and Keir Starmer have just handed sovereign British territory with a critical military base on it to a close ally of China. Why? So that David Lammy can feel better when he goes to a dinner party in north London. Whose interests does he think he serves?\u201d Jenrick said he would cap migration in \u201cthe tens of thousands or lower\u201d if he were in charge. Asked to put a number on his pledge to cap the number of people entering the UK, he said: \u201cI would do the tens of thousands or lower. The most important point is we\u2019ve got to get parliament to do this so we can look the public in the eye this time and say it\u2019s actually going to happen.\u201d He denied he was just making hardline remarks on immigration to win over Tory members. Jenrick claimed he had argued against the depletion of the armed forces while he served as a minister in the previous Tory government. He said: \u201cBecause I\u2019m a fiscal Conservative, the easiest thing in the world would be to say you today, let\u2019s spend more money on the armed forces without saying how are we going to get this money. I don\u2019t want taxes to rise, I don\u2019t want the state to get bigger, so I\u2019ve said let\u2019s take that money from our international aid budget and let\u2019s spend it on our armed forces. That is the best way.\u201d That\u2019s all from me, Tom Ambrose, for tonight. Thanks for following along throughout what was, admittedly, not one of the great political TV specials of our time. Have a very pleasant evening, nevertheless. The GB News special ended about half an hour ago but if you were left hungry for more from the leadership special, here is a smorgasbord of reaction on X: Robert Jenrick\u2019s team has said \u201cpoliticians should have policies\u201d after his leadership rival Kemi Badenoch spent much of her pitch to members suggesting that \u201cprinciples\u201d are a bigger priority. A spokesperson for Jenrick said: \u201cPoliticians should have policies \u2013 they do matter. None more so than on immigration. \u201cWe won\u2019t regain people\u2019s trust unless we set out what we\u2019d do differently this time. \u201cAfter the comparative performances tonight, the case for a real head-to-head debate is even stronger. Party members deserve to see these candidates debate the big challenges facing our country.\u201d There we go then. It\u2019s over. A poll of raised hands in the studio audience indicates an overwhelming majority would prefer Kemi Badenoch as Tory leader. Jenrick, although light on policy, did at least set out his stall for what his leadership would look like. It mainly involves re-running the ECHR as a sort of Brexit 2.0. He wants people to decide if they are \u201cleave or remain\u201d like it\u2019s 2016 all over again. By contrast, Badenoch was very open in admitting she had not given much thought to policy, instead focusing much of her time on culture war issues and her general dislike for the Guardian. Should we be embarrassed about our colonial past? \u201cNo \u2026 there are many countries now that want to use guilt to exploit the UK,\u201d she says. \u201cThese arguments are a scam \u2013 don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d Would you reverse VAT on private school bills? \u201cThat is the very first thing I would do if I become prime minister,\u201d she says, before quickly clarifying \u201cor one of the first things I will do\u201d. Do you allow your children to use social media? \u201cNo.\u201d Have you ever taken drugs? \u201cNo, never.\u201d Would you legalise cannabis? \u201cNo.\u201d Would you bring back fox hunting? She says it\u2019s not a priority for her right now. Donald Trump or Kamala Harris? \u201cI like both of them equally,\u201d she says, laughing. Would Nigel Farage be welcome as a Tory member? \u201cWe are a broad church but if somebody says they want to burn your church down, you don\u2019t let them in.\u201d Assisted suicide \u2013 how would you vote? \u201cLet\u2019s see what that bill looks like.\u201d Are you being mean to Rob Jenrick by saying \u201cif we get this wrong, there could be no party\u201d? Badenoch says \u201cwe have to fight for our survival, we cannot be complacent\u201d, referencing Reform as a big threat. What is Jenrick\u2019s biggest weakness? \u201cThe weakness is in the argument that is made,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the ECHR argument is not the right one. It will divide our party and mean infighting will continue\u201d. She adds that if we want to \u201cend the drama\u201d (used the old catchphrase against him there), the party needs to come together and find consensus. Is it possible to be party leader while being a mum? \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI might remind [Christopher Chope] that it isn\u2019t always women that have parental responsibilities.\u201d Should we pay stay-at-home parents? \u201cWe should look again at taxation on a family basis,\u201d she says. \u201cThose people that stay at home to look after children are providing a great contribution \u2026 and make it as easy for them as is possible to do so\u201d. Asked how she plans to get more out of the NHS, Badenoch says she wants reforms to be carried out in partnership with the service. \u201cWe have given it more money than before, we literally put a sign on the side of a bus,\u201d she says. \u201cMany people don\u2019t know that we gave it double that.\u201d And that\u2019s it for the live audience segment of Badenoch\u2019s pitch to Tory members. Next up, it\u2019s the quick-fire questions from people at home. An audience member is asking Badenoch about culture wars. \u201cWhen people use the phrase, it is a dog whistle to attack the right,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are defending our culture, we are defending our country.\u201d It is about doing what is right for our country and following conviction, she adds, before giving the Guardian yet another shout-out. \u201cIt is about being brave and not being scared that the Guardian is going to try and mock us, they are going to do that whoever the leader is\u201d, she says. We are back on to the ECHR. Badenoch is asked if she agrees with Jenrick about leaving the ECHR. \u201cIf we need to leave the ECHR to control migration, then we should do it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is not a silver bullet.\u201d Harking back to the same question Jenrick faced, she raises the fact that other countries are able to deport people easier than Britain. She says Northern Ireland and women\u2019s rights are areas that need to be considered before a decision to leave the ECHR is taken. \u201cI will have a wholesale strategy [on immigration] across govenment. Numbers matter, culture matters more,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all need to be moving in the same direction.\u201d When asked to put a figure on migration by Hope, she backtracks and says \u201cit\u2019s not about the numbers\u201d. Thirty seconds ago, she said \u201cnumbers matter\u201d. There is no point leaving the EU, if you continue to do what the EU is doing, Badenoch says when pressed on whether Brexit has been a success. \u201cOne of the reasons Brexit hasn\u2019t been as much of a success as it should be is that we didn\u2019t start with a plan,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t like how \u201ceverything is blamed on Brexit\u201d, she says. \u201cStop blaming Brexit for our problems.\u201d Hope says Badenoch had the chance to resolve problems with Brexit in government but didn\u2019t. She adds: \u201cI was very much against a bonfire of all regulations without thinking about the consequences. Why? Because I am an engineer.\u201d Is \u201cI\u2019m an engineer\u201d going to become the new \u201cI\u2019m the son of a toolmaker\u201d? Only time will tell. A question from the audience now about the planning system and what sort of reforms she might consider. \u201cThe planning system is a mess and is one of the areas that needs reform,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay our planning officers enough.\u201d Badenoch goes on to say that people are right to not want pylons built near their homes or have greenbelt land developed for housing. She says the problem is that net zero targets were created without a plan (the plan needs to be based on Conservative principles though, she adds). Asked about the bullying allegations first published by the Guardian, she says \u201cof course they run to the Guardian to tell lies about me\u201d. It\u2019s because she got the bad people out of her department, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many of you believe what you read in the Guardian, but if you do, then you wouldn\u2019t be here on GB News,\u201d she says. Charming. Hope asks if she is asking Tory members to vote for her based on trust and without the \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d of policies. \u201cI am somebody who you know delivers, I am somebody you know has a track record, you can trust me,\u201d she says. The policies will come, she adds. She wants to build a consensus first and wants to build a big team for the future. Applause follows and, dare I say it, even some whooping. Kemi Badenoch begins with her five-minute speech to the Tory faithful \u2013 after a slight slip-up from Hope, saying she is about to make a pitch to join the party. This leadership race is about character and conviction, she says. \u201cLet\u2019s not make the same mistake the Labour party made \u2026 hanging around until the other side loses,\u201d she adds. Freedom is what unites us and is going to get the Tories back into government, Badenoch says. \u201cMy message is not just for party members but also for those of you watching at home, who wanted to vote Conservative but felt that you couldn\u2019t; I need your support too,\u201d she says. There\u2019s an awful lot of references to the \u201cbroken system\u201d and Badenoch says she is the engineer who can fix the broken system. And breathe. Robert Jenrick\u2019s time on the stump for tonight is over. It looks like the studio audience \u2013 and us at home \u2013 are being given a five minute breather before Kemi Badenoch comes out to hit us with her vision of modern day Britain. It\u2019s fair to say, despite some gentle probing from moderator Christopher Hope, Bobby J (as he refers to himself on campaign merchandise) was light on policy. But if we can take one thing from his hour in the GB News spotlight, it\u2019s that despite insisting he wants to \u201cend the drama\u201d, Jenrick\u2019s big plan is to demand the British public decide whether they are \u201cleave or remain\u201d on the ECHR. He\u2019s leave, if that didn\u2019t come through clearly enough. Up next: Badenoch. Would Jenrick vote against a ban on trail hunting? \u201cI would do,\u201d says Jenrick. \u201cThe rural way of life is important.\u201d Should we pay slavery reparations for the UK\u2019s imperial past? \u201cNo, absolutely not,\u201d says Jenrick. Big applause from the Tory members in the audience for this. Would Nigel Farage be part of his team? \u201cI think Nigel Farage is rattled, he\u2019s talking about me a lot now,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to retire him.\u201d He adds that he\u2019s not \u201csold on\u201d letting Tory members vote on the party chairman but gives his \u201csolemn vow\u201d that they will choose their candidates. Asked who his favourite prime minister of the past 14 years has been, Jenrick says he can\u2019t pick favourites \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t be Liz\u201d. Brutal. Here we go, it\u2019s time for the quick-fire questions. Jenrick is asked what Kemi Badenoch\u2019s biggest weakness is but refuses to answer. Hope raises Christopher Chope\u2019s comments earlier on today about whether a mum can be a party leader. \u201cHe\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s definitely wrong,\u201d he says. Should stay-at-home mums receive payment in the tax system? Jenrick says he wants marriage to be rewarded in the tax system but says it\u2019s difficult because that is not why people get married. Hope asks if Jenrick supports Ozempic on the NHS, to which he says \u201cif others want to do it, good for them. I\u2019m not going to tell people how to live their lives\u201d. Did he take illegal drugs at university? No, says Jenrick. Here\u2019s our report on Chope\u2019s comments: A young audience member is asking about Jenrick\u2019s long-term plans to prevent mass migration and illegal immigration. Capping the number of immigrants is the answer, Jenrick tells us. And we are back on to the ECHR. He raises the case of a Ugandan man who was able to remain is Britain despite committing a violent crime. Hope says other countries, such as Italy and Germany are able to deport migrants, despite being members of the ECHR. Jenrick says \u201cit doesn\u2019t work for our system\u201d and once again says, \u201cwe will never fix this problem until we leave the ECHR\u201d. Hope is now asking about the crisis in Britain\u2019s prisons. \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything Keir Starmer tells you,\u201d he says, referencing how 500 places were found for those who took part in the racist riots in August. Jenrick is now making the prisons crisis about immigration again and says part of the solution is to deport foreign nationals currently in UK prisons. It\u2019s because of the ECHR that we cannot do that, he goes on. \u201cI don\u2019t think our country is quite as divided as some people say,\u201d Jenrick says, mere minutes after calling for people to decide on whether they are \u201cleave or remain\u201d over the ECHR. He says the only way the Tories can get back into power is to focus on \u201cdelivering for the British people\u201d but is unable or unwilling to answer how he plans to win back both Reform and Lib Dem voters. Jenrick is now tackling the question of how the Tories can attract younger voters to the party. \u201cYoung people are not fools; we\u2019ve got to give them a compelling vision to vote Conservative,\u201d he says. The solution is to cut taxes for working-age people and build more homes, he says. The biggest applause of the night so far, in the studio of Conservative voters, is for Jenrick calling to take money from the foreign aid budget to spend on defence. \u201cLet\u2019s invest more in our armed forced, let\u2019s get up to at least three per cent,\u201d he says. In a follow-up question, he is asked about the Chagos Islands. It is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d, he says, adding that he believes it has been done so that \u201cDavid Lammy can feel better about himself at a north London dinner party\u201d. \u201cI would not sell out our overseas territories,\u201d he says. Jenrick is now being asked about how he would tackle the housing crisis. \u201cThere are too few homes and too many young people trapped in their childhood bedrooms,\u201d he says. He suggests making the \u201cbig cities\u201d even denser by building on brownfield sites.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get a new generation of young people to believe in us, to support us and to vote for us.\u201d Hope suggests Jenrick sits on the centre-right of politics and is just tacking to the right in an effort to win support from the Tory grassroots. Jenrick says \u201calmost all the polls\u201d show he is the best candidate to bring back voters who defected to Reform, as well as the Lib Dems and Labour. \u201cI believe that our party has to be a broad church,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the party has to have a bit of religion, it has to believe in something which it hasn\u2019t in recent years.\u201d He repeats \u2013 for what is surely the fourth of fifth time so far \u2013 that he\u2019s all about \u201cending the drama\u201d. The first question from the audience is how to restore respect for the Conservative party after it\u2019s recent trouncing at the ballot box. Jenrick says \u201cI\u2019m not just standing to be the leader of the opposition, I want to be the next prime minister\u201d to muted applause. He raises immigration as the main issue facing Britain right now but it challenged by Hope on his own record in government, when immigration into Britain \u201cballooned\u201d. Jenrick says he is in favour of capping migration to \u201cthe tens of thousands or lower\u201d. He says he resigned from the cabinet over both legal and illegal migration. \u201cI don\u2019t want our party to keep making and breaking promises,\u201d he says. Jenrick goes on to say \u201creal choice facing our country is on the European Convention of Human Rights\u201d. He says being able to detain and deport people \u201cwithin days\u201d is the only way to \u201cstop the boats\u201d. He is now making the case for leaving the ECHR in favour for a so-called British Bill of Rights, he says, to \u201cend the insanity\u201d. It\u2019s clear Jenrick\u2019s pitch to the Tory members is what he calls a \u201cclear choice\u201d on the ECHR. He essentially wants to rerun Brexit. \u201cI\u2019m for leave,\u201d he says, before also saying he is in favour of capping immigration. He also says \u201clet\u2019s end the drama\u201d. It\u2019s decision time, moderator Christopher Hope tells the audience. Remember that recent estimates tell us there are about 172,500 Tory party members who will be making this big decision. GB News is now showing the coin toss from earlier, like it\u2019s the Wimbledon final. Kemi Badenoch got to choose and lost, so Robert Jenrick gets to give his five-minute opening pitch first. He starts by telling us the Tories \u201chave got to deliver on immigration\u201d. He says there are \u201chotels that should be full of tourists but instead are full of illegal migrants\u201d up and down the country. He says Tory policy (or lack of) on immigration are the reason the party lost the trust of four million voters who switched to Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party. \u201cWe have got to ensure that once again we are trusted on immigration,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I know how to do that.\u201d Good evening. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest from the showdown between the final two candidates to become Tory leader this evening. Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick will be put through their paces by moderator Christopher Hope, in front of an audience of Conservative members, on GB News from 7pm. Both candidates \u2013 who will be hoping to show the nation just why they are the best the Tories have to offer \u2013 will get five minutes to deliver an opening statement. They will then take questions from Hope and the GB News studio audience. It\u2019s going to be a long two hours but let\u2019s hope it gives us some sort of insight, one way or another, into what the Conservative party has to offer in 2024. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the key moments and top lines from what is the fourth Tory leadership contest in almost as many years. A welfare watchdog has criticised the government\u2019s decision to cut winter fuel payments for most pensioners. The social security advisory committee says the government should have carried out a full impact assessment before going ahead with the policy, and it says it is worried about the impact the policy will have on pensioner poverty. It also says it is not convinced by the government\u2019s argument that it is addressing this issue by encouraging more people to apply for pension credit, a benefit that enables people who qualify to carry on getting the winter fuel payment. The committee, an independent statutory body set up to advise the government on welfare, has set out its comments in a letter to Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary. The letter was sent on 20 September, but was only published today. In the letter Stephen Brien, the committee\u2019s chair, says: We were disappointed that an assessment of impact was not presented to the committee alongside the regulations on 11 September 2024. It has subsequently been confirmed that a full assessment of impact does not exist, with the prime minister commenting that it was not legally necessary and that \u201cThe impact will be mitigated by pension credit, by the housing benefit\u201d. Given the scale of pensioners who will be affected by this change, and the speed at which it is being introduced, we are not similarly reassured that this will be the case and are of the firm view that a more detailed assessment is urgently required, in particular, on the potential poverty impact. The committee makes various other recommendations, including saying people on full pensioner housing benefit should also continue to get the winter fuel payment, and demanding an assurance that enough staff are available to process new pension crediti claims. That is all from me for today. My colleague Tom Ambrose is taking over now. Nigel Farage has used a team of three US advisers to help him with \u201cperception management\u201d and public relations in America, as well as with settling a $3,500 hotel bill this summer, new documents show, Rowena Mason reports. The House of Commons wants you to tell it what it can do to make the place better. In particular, it wants to hear suggestions covering: -driving up standards; -improving culture and working practices; and -reforming parliamentary procedures to make the House of Commons more effective. The invitation is not just aimed at Guardian readers (although I am sure many of you have strong, and sensible, views, and I would encourage you to submit them). The Commons modernisation committee has opened a consultation inviting groups and individuals, inside parliament and outside, to propose ideas for reform. As it explains in its news release, submissions should be no more than 2,500 words and they should cover: 1) What topic(s) do you think the modernisation committee should prioritise and how do they link to one or more of the strategic aims set out in the leader\u2019s memorandum? 2) Why would the topic(s) benefit from the attention of the modernisation committee? 3) Are you aware of examples from other parliaments relevant to the topic(s) which may be interesting for the modernisation committee to consider? 4) Is there any existing work relevant to the topic(s) which you think the modernisation committee can build on? The committee is chaired by Lucy Powell, leader of the Commons. In a memo last month she set out some proposals for reform, including banning MPs from paid media work, but there are so many other topics it could cover it is hard to know where to start. You can submit ideas here. They have to be in before 3pm on 16 December. Paul Johnson is leaving his post as director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank next year. He has secured the dream job aspired to by members of the liberal intelligentsia elite \u2013 head of an Oxford college. Richard Partington has the story. At PMQs yesterday Keir Starmer was repeatedly asked by Rishi Sunak about Labour\u2019s approach to China. Starmer implied that his government would be just as robust as the last Conservative government, and he was critical of Beijing over its hostility towards Taiwan, its suppression of rights in Hong Kong and its links with Russia. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, is due to visit China from tomorrow and Amnesty International UK has issued a statement saying it hopes Lammy is just as robust in private. Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty\u2019s chief executive, said: This visit is a crucial opportunity for the foreign secretary to demonstrate the government\u2019s true commitment to challenging publicly and privately Beijing\u2019s brutal suppression of human rights in China and Hong Kong. Behind closed doors but also in public, David Lammy needs to tackle the Chinese government over its systematic, industrial-scale repression of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet, its widespread imprisonment of peaceful activists and its completely unacceptable intimidation of students and campaigners here in the UK. The prime minister\u2019s statement that the immediate release of the unjustly-imprisoned UK businessman Jimmy Lai is a UK priority is welcome, and Mr Lammy should also seek to secure the immediate release of fellow prisoners of conscience Hong Kong lawyer-activist Chow Hang-tung and Chinese human rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi, as well as the long-held Uighur economist Ilham Tohti and #MeToo activists Sophia Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. Throughout this trip, the Government should ensure that talks on trade and security relations with China aren\u2019t pursued at the expense of human rights. The Tory MP Christopher Chope defended his comments about Kemi Badenoch (see 12.57pm) in a subsequent interview with Andrew Neil on Times Radio. Chope said that Badenoch and Robert Jenrick could both be \u201cexcellent party leaders\u201d. And he said that there was \u201ca lot of mischief-making going on\u201d and that he was being misprepresented. I repeat the point which I was making before, and that is that Kemi has got a young family and so it\u2019s less likely that she\u2019s going to be able to spend as much time as is required as somebody who hasn\u2019t got the commitments of a young family. Now, that\u2019s not suggesting she\u2019s unsuited or anything like that to be the leader of the opposition \u2026 All I\u2019m saying is that one of the candidates has got a younger family than the other one, and has also got a record of wanting to spend more time with her family than engage in going to far-flung constituencies. Chope also said that, when he was a junior minister in the early 1990s, he was the father of a young baby. Labour and Lib Dem MPs have criticised the Conservative Christopher Chope for saying that Kemi Badenoch won\u2019t make a good party leader because she is \u201cpreoccupied\u201d with her three young children. (See 12.57pm.) This is from Helena Dollimore, the Labour MP for Hastings and Rye. I thought nothing could shock me about the state of the Conservative Party, but that was before I had to sit through Christopher Chope MP opining about whether mothers can lead political parties. \ud83e\udd96 I hope Robert Jenrick distances himself from these unhinged comments. This is from Tom Hayes, the Labour MP for Bournemouth East. Christopher Chope represents the seat beside mine. I wish I didn\u2019t have to say this, but as he takes this view, I\u2019d urge him to talk with mothers and find out what they achieve every day. We shouldn\u2019t be debating whether mothers can lead political parties. It\u2019s that simple. And these are from Liz Jarvis, the Lib Dem MP for Eastleigh. Outrageous but predictable comments from Christopher Chope. The idea that women can\u2019t hold positions with huge responsibility and still manage to be brilliant mums is antiquated, insulting and chauvinistic, to say the least. Even by Christopher Chope\u2019s standards, these comments are staggeringly ignorant and offensive. Diminishing women\u2019s ability to play leading roles in public life because they have young families is an attitude that should be in the distant past. Robert Jenrick should immediately condemn his remarks and Rishi Sunak must suspend the whip. If they do not, it is clear that they see these views as acceptable in the modern Conservative party. Jenrick\u2019s campaign has disowned Chope\u2019s remarks. (See 2.31pm.) Parliament\u2019s first \u201cbionic Lord\u201d has taken his seat on the red benches, where he has pledged to highlight the awareness of sepsis and improve the quality of prosthetics offered to amputees, PA Media reports. PA says: Craig Mackinlay is the first quadruple amputee to be introduced to the House of Lords after he was given a peerage in Rishi Sunak\u2019s dissolution honours list. Lord Mackinlay of Richborough wore the traditional scarlet robes for the short introduction ceremony in the upper chamber where he swore the oath of allegiance to the king. The 58-year-old was supported by fellow Conservative peers Lord Hayward and Lord Jackson of Peterborough. His wife and daughter were among family and friends who looked on from the gallery above as Lord Mackinlay signed the members\u2019 book with his \u201cbionic\u201d hand. Others watching in the chamber included Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, former deputy speaker Nigel Evans, and Conservative MP Mark Francois. Almost half of Conservative councillors polled this week believe that neither Robert Jenrick nor Kemi Badenoch will be able to win the next election, and a significant minority said they did not plan to vote in the leadership contest, Jessica Elgot reports. Robert Jenrick\u2019s campaign has disowned what Christopher Chope said about Kemi Badenoch. (See 12.57pm.) A campaign source said: Rob doesn\u2019t agree with this. He\u2019s raising three young daughters himself. In an interview broadcast this morning, Michael Gove, the former Tory cabinet minister and an ally of Kemi Badenoch\u2019s, said that, although Robert Jenrick had strengths as a leadership candidate, one problem was that he looked like a \u201cTory boy\u201d. (See 9.47am.) Now the Jenrick campaign has hit back. A spokesperson for Jenrick said: Michael Gove and his acolytes have been responsible for so much of the infighting and drama that has led our party to where it is. Rob\u2019s going to end that drama and the excuses that followed and just deliver for our country. The school absence rate for England for the autumn and spring terms of 2023-24 was down on the same period the year before \u2013 but still much higher than pre-pandemic, according to figures out from the Department for Education. The overall absence rate in the autumn and spring terms of 2023-24 was 6.9%, down from 7.3% the previous year, the DfE says. That figure covers primary schools, secondary schools and special schools. Pre-pandemic, the comparable figures were below 5%. Today\u2019s figures also show that 19.2% of pupils were persistent absentees, meaning they missed 10% or more of school sessions. The equivalent figure for 2022-23 was 21.2% Commenting on the figures, Paul Whiteman, general secretary at school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: Schools are working incredibly hard to boost attendance, and it is positive that these figures have improved overall year on year. However, the reasons for absence often lie beyond the school gates, and it is clear schools need more support to tackle unauthorised absence and the often deep-rooted issues facing children and families. These include everything from sickness and mental health problems, to poverty and other social challenges. Previous governments failed to properly fund vital services like social care and CAMHS, while important roles like education welfare officers were cut. Downing Street has said that government departments will have to become \u201cmore productive\u201d in response to the funding challenges facing the government. The PM\u2019s spokesperson used the phrase at the morning lobby briefing, where he also played down reports suggesting that some ministers are complaining strongly about the spending settlements they have been offered by the Treasury. The spokesperson said that the overall spending total for Whitehall has now been agreed \u2013 but he said some departmental spending budgets within that total were still being negotiated. Asked about reports that ministers have been writing to Keir Starmer directly with concerns about their budget settlement, the spokesperson said: I am obviously not going to get drawn into specifics of spending review discussions, but clearly engagement between departments and the Treasury and No 10 ahead of the budget and a spending review are a standard part of the process where departments will set out their priorities and the challenges that they are facing. The spokeperson said government departments would \u201chave to become more productive\u201d and may need to undertake reforms. Not every department will be able to do everything they want to. There will be tough decisions taken, there will be tough conversations, but ultimately this government has been very clear that it will fix the foundations, it will fix the position in relation to the public finances. Explaining what has already been agreed, he said: The prime minister and the chancellor have agreed what is known as the major measures \u2026 which have been submitted to the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] as per a timetable that is set out on the OBR website. That submission includes the overall spending envelope, which is now closed, and then individual departmental spending review negotiations are now being concluded. The Magistrates\u2019 Association has welcomed the news that magistrates will get the power to sentence offenders for up to 12 months in jail, not six. (See 12.21pm). It is a change it has been calling for. But it says the criminal justice system also needs more investement. Tom Franklin, the association\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement: Extending the range of cases that magistrates can hear to include those which carry a maximum sentence of 12 months, is something we had long campaigned for as a vital means of ensuring speedier justice for victims, witnesses and defendants \u2026 But such a change is not problem-free. There are serious bottlenecks in magistrates\u2019 courts too, particularly with the lack of availability of legal advisers and probation officers needed to support magistrates, which often leads to delays and cancellations. So, to be most effective, this change would need to go together with more court resources. There must be a long-term, sustainable and considered investment in the whole criminal justice system, which we and many others have long called for. The Conservative MP Christopher Chope has said that he is backing Robert Jenrick for Tory leader, not Kemi Badenoch, partly because he thinks having three young children will distract her. In an interview with ITV Meridian, Chope said: I myself am supporting Robert Jenrick because I think he\u2019s brought more energy and commitment to the campaign, and being leader of the opposition is a really demanding job. And, much as I like Kemi, I think she\u2019s preoccupied with her own children, quite understandably. I think Robert\u2019s children are a bit older, and I think that it\u2019s important that whoever leads the opposition has got an immense amount of time and energy. When it was put to him that he was saying a woman with young children could not lead a political party, Chope denied that. He said that he was one of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s strongest supporters (although both Thatcher\u2019s two children were in their 20s when she became Tory leader.) He also said that he understood \u201ctalking to colleagues that Kemi spends a lot of time with her family\u201d. That was not possible to combine with being opposition leader, he claimed. Badenoch and Jenrick both have three children. Jenrick\u2019s are 13, 11 and nine. Badenoch\u2019s are younger, but not by much. They are 12, seven and five. Speaking on the same ITV Meridien programme, the Labour MP Helena Dollimore said: I think many women will be shocked by those comments. I\u2019m really proud that we live in a country where we\u2019ve had women who have become prime minister, we\u2019ve got the first woman chancellor at the moment, I think there should be no barrier to women standing in public life. Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, has told MPs that magistrates are getting powers to sentence offenders for longer \u2013 to reduce the number of prisoners being held on remand and to cut the backlog in crown courts In a statement to MPs, she said that, although this would increase the prison population slightly, by reducing the number of offenders being held on remand it would free up spaces in reception prisons where overcrowding is particularly serious. She said that there are currently 17,000 prisoners on remand in England and Wales, accouting for almost a fifth of the entire jail population. She said: Unless we address our remand population, we could still see a collapse of the system, not because of a lack of cells, but because we do not have those cells in the places that we need them. It is therefore crucial that we bear down on the remand population. Mahmood said magistrates currently only have the power to sentence people to up to six months in jail. She said the last government, between May 2022 and March 2023, allowed magistrates to sentence people to up to 12 months, and this meant magistrates could hear more cases, and those cases got dealt with more quickly. But the last government went back to six months when pressure on prison places became too great, she said. Mahmood told MPs, that because of early release measures taken by Labour to reduce overcrowding, she was now reverting to giving magistrates the power to sentence people for up to 12 months. The change will come into force on 18 November, she said. Explaining how this would help the criminal justice system, she went on: This government inherited a record crown court backlog. Waits for trials have grown so long that some cases are not heard for years. The impact on victims of crime is profound. For some justice delayed is, as the old saying goes, justice denied as victims choose to withdraw from the justice process altogether rather than face the pain of a protracted legal battle. By extending magistrates\u2019 powers, we will be able to make progress on addressing the crown court backlog, and we will free the crown court to take on more of the cases that only they can hear. This measure is expected to free up an equivalent of 2,000 sitting days within the crown court each year, which will add capacity on top of the additional 500 sitting days that this government funded on taking office. This measure will, in total, see a slight increase in the overall prison population, but by bearing down on the remand population of our reception prisons, we will create capacity where we need it most. This measure allows us to manage our prison population smartly, and it means we can both address our prisons crisis and tackled the courts\u2019 backlog. The Foreign Office has announced a fresh round of sanctions against Russian oil tankers and liquified gas tankers. It has sanctioned 18 oil tankers, four liquified gas tankers, and the Russian gas company Rusgazdobycha JSC. In a statement, David Lammy said Britain was \u201cleading the charge against Putin\u2019s desperate and dangerous attempts to cling on to his energy revenues\u201d. He added: I have made it my personal mission to constrain the Kremlin, closing the net around Putin and his mafia state using every tool at my disposal. The sanctions cover tankers from what is described as Russia shadow fleet. Ships that are sanctioned are banned from UK ports. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP introducing the private member\u2019s bill to legalise assisted dying, has invited the archbishop of Canterbury to meet her after he described a change in the law as dangerous, Harriet Sherwood reports. As mentioned earlier, there is still a lot of budget talk around \u2013 as there will be for the next fortnight. Here are three articles worth reading. Steven Swinford, Oliver Wright and Patrick Maguire in the Times splash say Rachel Reeves will raise capital gains tax \u2013 but not for second homes. They report: The Times has been told that capital gains on profits from the sale of shares, which is currently levied at a higher rate of 20 per cent, is likely to rise by \u201cseveral percentage points\u201d \u2026 As well as raising capital gains on share profits, Reeves is also expected to end some reliefs in the current regime to increase potential revenues as she seeks to repair the public finances and avoid a return to austerity. One government source suggested that revenues from increasing capital gains tax would be in the \u201clow billions\u201d. The chancellor will leave the rate of capital gains tax on the sale of second homes and buy-to-let properties untouched amid concerns that increasing it would cost money. Tom Baldwin in the Spectator says the Keir Starmer is becoming more focused on explaining what the government will do to improve things for people and a budget-related document will be published helping with this. He says: The renewed focus is on Rachel Reeves\u2019s first Budget on 30 October. \u2018We know it will be a fight and it\u2019s important we pick the right one,\u2019 said one senior aide. Although everyone within Downing Street to whom I\u2019ve spoken in recent days insists that the missions are not being abandoned, that there is a \u2018narrowing, focusing and tightening\u2019 around a series of \u2018tangible and deliverable goals for working people\u2019. These will be \u2018staging posts that tell a story to the country about where we want to be in two, three and four years\u2019 time\u2019. Starmer is understood to be working on a document with Reeves and Pat McFadden at the Cabinet Office using a mass of polling evidence commissioned by [chief of staff Morgan] McSweeney. Provisionally titled \u2018Priorities for Change\u2019, this is expected to be published before the budget so that identifiable connections between the missions run through what the Treasury decides to do. Sam Coates at Sky News says some departments missed a deadline last night for agreeing their spending settlements with the Treasury. He says: A number of departments have still been unable to agree with the Treasury the scale of cuts they will be expected to deliver in the next two years, despite discussions stretching back to July. Close of play on Wednesday was meant to be the deadline for all major measures agreed for the budget to be sent to the spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. After this moment, only small changes are meant to be possible in the budget and spending review for the financial year beginning next April. Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leadership candidate, has said that she would offer JK Rowling a peerage if she became party leader. As equalities minister Badenoch was instrumental in getting the UK government to block the Scottish parliament\u2019s gender recognition reform bill, which would have drastically simplified the process for trans people wanting to obtain a gender recognition certificate confirming their change of gender. JK Rowling, the author, was one of the leading gender critical feminists opposing the change, and she and Badenoch became allies in opposing the extension of trans rights. They say they are defending sex-based rights. As the Times reports, asked if she would offer Rowling a peerage in an interview with Talk TV, Badenoch replied: I would. I don\u2019t know whether she would take it, but I certainly would give her a peerage. She also said that people like her and Rowling had been \u201cattacked relentlessly by all sorts of oddballs and bad people\u201d because of their views on sex and gender. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, was doing a media round this morning to highlight the news that primary schools in England can now bid for government money to set up nurseries. The Department for Education says in a news release: Primary schools can now apply for up to \u00a3150,000 of \u00a315 million capital funding, with the first stage of the plan set to support up to 300 new or expanded nurseries across England. This comes as 321,462 additional children are now accessing 15 hours of government-funded early education per week, since the government delivered on the promises made to parents for the second phase of the childcare rollout last month. Under plans first announced by the last government, working parents with children aged 9-months or older were eligible for 15 hours of free nursery care per week from September this year. It is due to rise to 30 hours from September next year. But there is concern there are not enough places to meet the demand. Phillipson said in interviews this morning today\u2019s announcement would help to expand capacity. She also said that in some parts of the country the shortage was \u201cvery stark\u201d. She told the Today programme: We\u2019re also publishing more information about where there are gaps at a local level, so that providers have got a better sense of where the gaps are, so that they can look to create more capacity in those areas where we have the fewest places, and in some parts of the country it\u2019s very stark. You know, for every child, you know there is, there is a real gap. In its news release about these figures the DfE says: According to the Department for Education\u2019s latest projections, around 70,000 additional places and 35,000 early years educators will still be needed to deliver the expansion to 30 hours next September, with some of the most disadvantaged areas in need of the largest uplifts. Published for the first time, the projections show that around half of local areas need to increase their capacity by between 10% and 20% to meet demand for September. Some need an uplift of more than 20% - with areas that see traditionally lower household incomes including Northumberland, Plymouth and Rotherham all in this group. That\u2019s why the government is taking action now, and providing schools, private providers and local authorities a clear picture of the department\u2019s understanding of demand, and where there are gaps in supply. Arriving at the meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, John Healey, the defence secretary, has confirmed that Britain is putting thousands of troops on standby to deploy to Estonia\u2019s border with Russia. PA Media says: Soldiers in the army\u2019s 4th Brigade will be held at \u201chigh readiness\u201d in order to defend Nato\u2019s eastern flank with Russia, under a new co-operation agreement Healey will sign with his Estonian counterpart \u2026 Some 1,000 British troops are already deployed in Estonia. If deployed, 4th Brigade troops \u2013 who are specialists in operating in Estonia\u2019s Baltic terrain \u2013 could be sent there alongside helicopters and rocket launchers. The 4th Brigade, based at Bourlon Barracks, North Yorkshire, would be deployed within 10 days if called up to travel to Estonia under the plans. The army\u2019s most advance tanks, the Challenger 3, as well as the Boxer armoured vehicle, could also be deployed in Estonia in future years. Army brigades differ in size, but as many as 5,000 troops could be placed on standby under the pact, which will begin in July 2025. Michael Gove, the former Tory cabinet minister who is now editor of the Spectator, has said that having Robert Jenrick as leader might hold the Tories back because he looks like a \u201cTory boy\u201d. Gove has long been a strong supporter of Kemi Badenoch, who worked for him as a junior minister in the communities department, and so it is not surprising that, when asked about both candidates in an interview for the Today programme\u2019s podcast, he chose to praise her more than Jenrick. But Gove would not confirm that he was voting for Badenoch, claiming that the Spectator was more interested in backing causes than candidates, and that his personal endorsement might be counter-productive. Asked about the candidates, he said they were both friends of his. He went on: Robert\u2019s strengths are diligence, rigour, hunger. He is someone who has focused in on some of the big questions that have been the Conservative party\u2019s internal conversation. And he has answers; you may not like them, but he has precise and specific solutions. Now, I think one of Robert\u2019s weaknesses, and I speak as someone who has the same d\u00e9formation professionnelle, he looks like a typical Tory politician. When it was put to him that he was accusing Jenrick of being a \u201cTory boy\u201d, Gove went on: So am I. It\u2019s a stain that I bear. And given the strength of feeling against Tory boys expressed at the last general election, that\u2019s a challenge. Asked about Badenoch, he said: I\u2019m very fond of Kemi because at a critical moment when I was running for the leadership in 2019 she was conspicuously brave in my defence, when she didn\u2019t need to be. And courage is Kemi\u2019s hallmark. So one of the criticisms directed at her is that she\u2019s too willing to get involved in a scrap. I actually think it is a virtue. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, was on the media round on behalf of No 10 this morning. In an interview on the Today programme, asked if she was one of the cabinet ministers who have written to the PM complaining about their departmental spending allocation in the budget, she refused to say. She replied: There are lots of conversations happening right now across government, between the chancellor, with members of the cabinet, as you would expect in the usual way as part of the budget process. Asked if the education budget was protected, she replied: Education is always a priority for Labour governments. What I\u2019d say to you is you don\u2019t have too long to wait to hear the chancellor announce her budget in just under a fortnight, so I\u2019m afraid everyone\u2019s going to have to wait until 30 October to see exactly what\u2019s in the budget. According to the Times, the ministers who have written to the PM include Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, and Louise Haigh, the transport secretary. In their story, Oliver Wright, Patrick Maguire and Steven Swinford say: Sources said there was concern \u201cright across the cabinet\u201d, and particularly in departments whose spending was \u201cunprotected\u201d \u2026 A senior Treasury source said that ministers had not understood the scale of the challenge facing Reeves. \u201cThey\u2019re using a classic trade union negotiating tactic,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have any spare cash lying around to give them. This is only phase one of the spending review \u2014 as soon as the budget is over, we\u2019re going to have to do this all over again.\u201d Allies of the chancellor admitted that her decision to prioritise long-term investment over day-to-day spending in the budget had alienated colleagues. \u201cInvestment is a key part of this budget and is in the top three things we can actually deliver before the next election,\u201d a source said. Good morning. Members of the Conservative party have started getting their ballot papers for the leadership election, and this evening Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick will take part in what may be the only TV event of this stage of the contest \u2013 a hustings on GB News starting at 7pm. They won\u2019t go head to head, but they each take questions for an hour. We will be covering it live (although a colleague will be at the helm, not me). Badenoch remains the bookmakers\u2019 favourite, but Jenrick gets a boost today from Electoral Calculus polling, reported in the Telegraph, suggesting that the Tories would do better with him as leader. In his write-up, Charles Hymas says: Mr Jenrick, the former immigration minister, would win 50 extra seats if he was leader of the Tories compared with 30 seats that would be gained if Kemi Badenoch, his rival for the top job, was in charge of the party, according to the poll of nearly 6,300 people by Electoral Calculus \u2026 Under Mr Jenrick, the Conservatives would increase their number of seats from 121 to 178, with Labour falling from 412 to 311, the Liberal Democrats dropping from 72 to 58 and Reform rising from five to 24. That would place Labour 14 seats short of a majority. Under Mrs Badenoch, the Conservatives would increase their number of seats from 121 to 151, while Labour would fall from 412 to 332, the Lib Dems would dip from 72 to 63 and Reform rise from five to 25. That would see Labour in government with a 14-seat majority. This is interesting, but only up to a point, for two reasons. First, the performance gap between Jenrick and Badenoch, according to these figures, and in truth no one can be sure who would be best for the Tories because voters don\u2019t know a huge amount about either of them, and it is impossible to know for sure how they would perform as leaders. And, second, Conservative members aren\u2019t always very interested in picking the candidate most popular with the electorate at large (which is partly why things started going wrong for them). I will post more on the Tories as the day goes on. Apart from the GB News hustings, the diary is relatively light today, but there is still a lot of talk about the budget. As Eleni Courea reports, some cabinet ministers have been writing to Keir Starmer complaining about the cuts they are being asked to implement. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: John Healey, the defence secretary, attends a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. 9.30am: Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes figures on the disability pay gap. 9.30am: The Department for Education publishes figures on pupil absences in England. 10.30am: Lucy Powell, leader of the Commons, takes questions on next week\u2019s Commons business. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 7pm: Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick take part in a leadership hustings on GB News. They will be questioned by party members, separately, with Christopher Hope, the GB News political editor, presenting. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I\u2019m still using X and I\u2019ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian). I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct). And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

The event on GB News, the only debate scheduled, involved the pair taking turns to tackle questions from audience members rather than going head to head, but featured notable differences of opinion on strategy and policies such as immigration. Jenrick, going first, repeatedly pledged to \u201cend the drama\u201d in the Tory party, seen as a coded reference to Badenoch\u2019s sometimes combustible approach. Badenoch was polite about her opponent as a person but scathing when it came to his suite of headline policies, notably Jenrick\u2019s repeated pledge to immediately quit the European convention on human rights (ECHR), which he again styled on Thursday as a Brexit-type \u201cleave or remain\u201d issue. Badenoch argued the idea was a distraction from bigger worries and not properly thought-out. \u201cWe need to stop blaming the EU or international agreements and start fixing problems here ourselves,\u201d she said. Leaving the ECHR was \u201cnot dissimilar to leaving the EU in terms of the consequences\u201d, Badenoch said, in that there could be significant repercussions for Northern Ireland, where the convention forms an integral part of the peace process. Badenoch, who gained noticably more applause than Jenrick from the audience of Tory members and won a post-event show of hands, criticised Jenrick\u2019s policy focus, saying that with an election still far away, the party needed to first look at its fundamentals. \u201cThis is not a general election,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had one of those already, and we lost.

She hit back vehemently at accusations she had been part of a bullying and toxic culture as a minister, claiming she had removed problematic staff from her department who had then \u201crun to the Guardian to tell lies about me\u201d.

With ballots being sent to party members this week and the winner due to be announced on 2 November, the debate could be the only televised set-piece event of the contest, with other mooted events on the BBC and the Sun\u2019s YouTube channel mired in disagreements over format. While the response to both candidates was generally warm and the questions unchallenging, there is evidence that not every Tory member is pleased with being forced to make a choice between two candidates from the populist right of the party, after James Cleverly was removed in the final round of MPs\u2019 voting. A poll of Conservative councillors this week by Savanta found that almost half believe neither Jenrick nor Badenoch will be able to win the next election, and a significant minority said they did not plan to vote in the leadership contest.",

      "bodyText": "Israel has killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in southern Gaza. Here is what we know so far: Israel\u2019s military said it had killed Sinwar, who is seen as the architect of the 7 October attack in Israel, in Gaza. In a statement, the IDF said: \u201cAfter completing the process of identifying the body, it can be confirmed that Yahya Sinwar was eliminated.\u201d The statement came shortly after the Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, also said Sinwar had been killed. \u201cMass murderer Yahya Sinwar, who was responsible for the massacre and atrocities of 7 October, was killed today by IDF soldiers,\u201d Katz said in a statement. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described Sinwar\u2019s death as \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d but warned the \u201ctask before us is not yet complete\u201d. In a press conference, Netanyahu said Israel will continue to work until the end of the war. To the people of Israel, Netanyahu said that there are \u201ca lot of challenges still facing us\u201d and that \u201cwe have to remain resilient\u201d and \u201cstand firm on our ground and to continue to fight\u201d. He added: \u201cWe will not stop the war. We will go into Rafah.\u201d The US president, Joe Biden said Israeli reports that Sinwar had been killed marked a \u201cgood day\u201d for Israel, the US and the world and compared it to how Americans felt after Osama bin Laden\u2019s death. Biden said in a statement that DNA tests confirmed Sinwar\u2019s death. Biden reportedly spoke to Netanyahu and they agreed to work towards a deal to free the remaining hostages. Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, said \u201cjustice has been served\u201d after Sinwar\u2019s death was announced. She said \u201cthis moment gives us an opportunity to end the war in Gaza\u201d and stressed the need to end suffering in Gaza. Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, has commended the Israeli military, the Shin Bet intelligence agency, and the security services for the killing of Sinwar. In a post to X, Herzog described Sinwar as the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel and for being \u201cresponsible for heinous acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians\u201d for years.

The dangerous packages, which caught light at DHL sites in Birmingham and Leipzig, are not thought to have been sophisticated but in both cases appear to have evaded security checks. German authorities warned this week that a plane could have been downed if the devices, which were both sent by air, had ignited in flight. Brandon Fried, executive director of the Airforwarders Association, which represents the air freight industry in the US, described the incendiary bomb incidents as disconcerting given the suspicion of Russian state involvement. \u201cIt looks like the goal is simply to disrupt the supply chain, create havoc and simply to scare people. They want people to lose confidence in the system,\u201d Fried said, adding that the industry had developed robust and evolving security procedures since 9/11. Counter-terror police in Britain are investigating whether the Birmingham incident is linked to the one in Leipzig, amid a strong belief that the incendiary devices were the work of Russian spies. The parcel that ignited at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham on 22 July appears to have travelled by air before reaching the UK. Nobody was hurt and the incident, first reported by the Guardian, was dealt with by fire crews and staff. The German package started burning as it was about to be loaded on to a plane at Leipzig at the end of July, German media has reported, and the head of the country\u2019s domestic intelligence service warned on Monday it could have brought down an aircraft. Security sources said questions about how the packages got on to DHL sites were a question for the courier company, given the security procedures that exist at airports to prevent explosives and devices that can cause fires getting on to planes. DHL said in a statement on Thursday that it employed \u201cstringent security and safety measures throughout our global network\u201d and that it worked \u201cin full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and procedures\u201d. German authorities issued a warning at the end of August of \u201cunconventional incendiary devices\u201d that appeared to have been dispatched by private individuals, which \u201ccaught fire \u2026 in several European countries\u201d. They said there could be further attacks in an effort to damage logistics across Europe. Intelligence agencies across Europe have been warning of a growing number of arson, sabotage and even murder plots being carrying out by Russian intelligence in an attempt to sow discord among western backers of Ukraine. Last week, Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, warned that Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence appeared to be on \u201ca sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets\u201d and accused the Kremlin of being engaged in \u201cdangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness\u201d. Incendiary devices are generally considered to be relatively unsophisticated compared with explosives, so constructing them may not have required a high level of technical knowhow.

      "bodyText": "At least 28 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school turned shelter in the Jabaliya neighbourhood of Gaza City, amid accusations Israel intends to forcibly expel the remaining population in a renewed ground campaign. The bombing of Abu Hussein school in Jabaliya on Thursday killed 28, including doctors and several children, and injured dozens more, according to health officials, who warned the final toll was likely to be higher. Another 11 people were killed in two separate airstrikes in Gaza City, and it was unclear how many were killed in other strikes in central and southern Gaza. The attack on the Jabaliya school also caused a fire. \u201cThere is no water to extinguish the fire. There is nothing. This is a massacre,\u201d said medic Medhat Abbas. \u201cCivilians and children are being killed, burned under fire.\u201d The Israeli military said the strike targeted militants from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operating from within the school, claiming dozens of fighters were present when the strike took place. In a statement, Hamas denied any militants were using the school as a base. Thursday\u2019s attacks came as Israel\u2019s latest campaign in Jabaliya, a district of Gaza City, reaches its second week. An estimated 400,000 people are trapped by the fighting, with dwindling humanitarian supplies. Israel has nominally controlled Gaza City since the beginning of the year, but has repeatedly been forced to re-engage in areas under its control as Hamas has regrouped. On Wednesday, after a warning from the US that Israel must allow more aid to reach Gaza or face a cut off in military support, Israel allowed 50 lorries carrying food, water and medical equipment to enter northern Gaza. Israel had previously not allowed any aid to enter the north since the start of the month, leading the UN World Food Programme to once again raise the alarm of imminent famine. Jabaliya residents said on Thursday that several streets were blown up in bombings, by tank fire and controlled detonations, and that Jabaliya, together with the northern towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, are now under a complete siege. The entirety of northern Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders. Among those who have remained in the north are disabled or elderly people and their families, who say it is too dangerous and difficult to move. Israel has so far not allowed anyone from above what is now known as the Netzarim corridor bisecting the strip to return home; those clinging on in the north fear that if they leave, they will face the same fate. \u201cWe have written our death notes, and we are not leaving Jabaliya,\u201d one resident told Reuters via a chat app. \u201cThe occupation [Israel] is punishing us for not leaving our houses in the early days of the war, and we are not going now either. They are blowing up houses, and roads, and are starving us but we die once and we don\u2019t lose our pride,\u201d the father of four said, refusing to give his name, fearing Israeli reprisal. Earlier this week, the Israeli-Palestinian rights groups B\u2019Tselem, Gisha, Yesh Din and Physicians for Human Rights called on the international community to prevent Israel from carrying out the \u201cgenerals\u2019 plan\u201d, described as a \u201cstarve or surrender\u201d strategy for Gaza City that could amount to war crimes.

Issa had been targeted when moving between locations and unaccompanied by hostages. After the strike, Hamas leaders cut communications entirely, with each other or anyone else, for days for fear of infiltration or a technological security breach that could expose them all.</p>    <p>In July, a massive Israeli airstrike in al-Mawasi, a supposedly safe humanitarian zone in Gaza, killed <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/13/who-is-the-hamas-military-chief-mohammed-dief\">Mohammed Deif</a></strong><strong>,</strong> Sinwar\u2019s closest aide. Another veteran of decades of militancy, the 58-year-old had escaped seven previous assassination attempts by Israel, though is thought to have sustained permanent injuries. Deif oversaw suicide bombing campaigns in the 1990s and, more recently, Hamas\u2019 efforts to build more effective rockets in Gaza and the immense tunnel complex across the territory. He is also thought to have been tasked with training Hamas\u2019 elite Nukhba forces. The attack that killed him also killed 90 civilians.</p>    <p><strong>Fuad Shukr</strong>, a founder member of Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based Iran-backed militia, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/30/beirut-suburbs-hit-in-airstrike-targeting-hezbollah-commander-israel-says\">killed by an air strike on July 30</a>. Shukr, 63, had been involved in the massive suicide bombings launched against US, French and Israeli targets in 1983. He played a key role in developing Hezbollah\u2019s military capabilities, took on a role as chief of staff within Hezbollah and was a senior military adviser to its leader, Hassan Nasrallah.</p>    <p>A day later, <strong>Ismail Haniyeh</strong><strong>,</strong> the chairman of Hamas\u2019s guiding council, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/31/top-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-iran-explainer\">died when a bomb exploded</a> in his bedroom in a government guesthouse in Tehran.

      "bodyText": "Israel on Thursday confirmed the death of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the 7 October 2023 attacks. The assassination was just the latest in a series of killings of senior Hamas leaders and other militants since that assault and the beginning of the war in Gaza. Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy chair of Hamas\u2019s guiding council and founding member, was killed in Beirut by a suspected Israeli air strike in January 2024. The 57-year-old was accused of running Hamas military operations in the occupied West Bank, and playing a key role in the group\u2019s financial networks. Arouri was also believed to run relations between Hamas and other groups, including Hezbollah and the small Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In March this year, an airstrike killed Marwan Issa, a senior military commander and one of the closed circle who had known of the 7 October attack plan. Issa had been targeted when moving between locations and unaccompanied by hostages. After the strike, Hamas leaders cut communications entirely, with each other or anyone else, for days for fear of infiltration or a technological security breach that could expose them all. In July, a massive Israeli airstrike in al-Mawasi, a supposedly safe humanitarian zone in Gaza, killed Mohammed Deif, Sinwar\u2019s closest aide. Another veteran of decades of militancy, the 58-year-old had escaped seven previous assassination attempts by Israel, though is thought to have sustained permanent injuries. Deif oversaw suicide bombing campaigns in the 1990s and, more recently, Hamas\u2019 efforts to build more effective rockets in Gaza and the immense tunnel complex across the territory. He is also thought to have been tasked with training Hamas\u2019 elite Nukhba forces. The attack that killed him also killed 90 civilians. Fuad Shukr, a founder member of Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based Iran-backed militia, was killed by an air strike on July 30. Shukr, 63, had been involved in the massive suicide bombings launched against US, French and Israeli targets in 1983. He played a key role in developing Hezbollah\u2019s military capabilities, took on a role as chief of staff within Hezbollah and was a senior military adviser to its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. A day later, Ismail Haniyeh, the chairman of Hamas\u2019s guiding council, died when a bomb exploded in his bedroom in a government guesthouse in Tehran. Haniyeh, 60, was visiting the Iranian capital for the inauguration of the new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Another founding member of Hamas, Haniyeh is not thought to have had prior knowledge of the 7 October attacks and his relationship with Sinwar was tense. Dozens of his family members have reportedly been killed in Israeli strikes and shelling in Gaza. In September, Hassan Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for more than three decades, was killed by Israel in a series of strikes on the group\u2019s underground headquarters in Dahieh, a southern suburb of Beirut. Nasrallah, 64, built up a fervent personal following, steering the Shia Muslim movement through a number of transitions, balancing the demands of its military role with those of its expansive social welfare systems, building a political wing and negotiating the various crises that broke across the region. He earned adulation from supporters and bitter personal enmity from foes.",

Experts say a system that can create group statements that reflect majority and minority views is able to help people find common ground.

Writing in the journal Science, Summerfield and colleagues from Google DeepMind report how they built the \u201cHabermas Machine\u201d \u2013 an AI system named after the German philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas. The system works by taking written views of individuals within a group and using them to generate a set of group statements designed to be acceptable to all. Group members can then rate these statements, a process that not only trains the system but allows the statement with the greatest endorsement to be selected. Participants can also feed critiques of this initial group statement back into the Habermas Machine to result in a second collection of AI-generated statements that can again be ranked, and a final revised text selected. The team used the system in a series of experiments involving a total of more than 5,000 participants in the UK, many of whom were recruited through an online platform. In each experiment, the researchers asked participants to respond to topics, ranging from the role of monkeys in medical research to religious teaching in public education.

The death of the man who&nbsp;masterminded the 7 October massacres in southern Israel that killed more than 1,200 people would mark a key moment in the conflict. It could renew momentum for a ceasefire deal and hostage release \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hostage-families-demand-govt-leverage-sinwars-apparent-demise-to-secure-immediate-deal/\">families</a> of those held have demanded. With the group\u2019s two other key figures&nbsp;already dead, Benjamin Netanyahu could declare victory.</p> <p>There is no sign that he is prepared to do so without intense and sustained pressure on him \u2013 the sort of pressure that the US has repeatedly been unwilling to exert. Mr Netanyahu knows that protracting conflict extends his political life. It seems more likely that he will vow that it\u2019s time to finish the job. The Israeli prime minister said last month\u2019s killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, had \u201csettled the score\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-boosted-israel-regains-confidence-with-nasrallah-hit-2024-09-30/\">his approval ratings rose</a>. Then Israel launched its ground offensive in Lebanon.</p> <p>Yet as attention moved to the northern front, the conflict in Gaza intensified. The horror of seeing the teenager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/civilians-trapped-in-northern-gaza-by-israeli-offensive-against-hamas\">Shaban al-Dalou</a> burned to death due to an Israeli strike on a hospital compound seized international attention. But many more face deaths no less cruel. The UN says that 345,000 people face <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-gaza-aid-war-hamas-netanyahu-united-nations-starvation-letter-rcna175868\">\u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels of hunger</a> in the coming months, and&nbsp;almost all of the 2 million population face \u201cacute&nbsp;food insecurity\u201d, with barely any food entering&nbsp;in the last fortnight.</p> <p>This looks like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/23/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-plan-northern-gaza-palestinian-civilians-hamas\">\u201cthe generals\u2019 plan\u201d</a> \u2013 a blueprint for human rights violations drawn up by retired military figures. Mr Netanyahu said he was <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-tells-lawmakers-hes-considering-generals-plan-to-lay-siege-to-northern-gaza/\">considering </a>it, and both <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0c9e82c-3c83-4bda-a7f9-157ce32d8c12\">human rights groups</a> and Israeli personnel say that they believe <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-10-16/ty-article/.premium/on-defense-and-offense-israel-given-another-reminder-of-its-reliance-on-the-united-states/00000192-91aa-dbf3-a1be-ddbb246c0000\">it is already under way.</a> It calls for the besieging of northern Gaza; all civilians would be told to leave and the military would assume that those remaining were terrorists and cut off all supplies. In the longer term, ministers have already <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-gvir-calls-to-encourage-emigration-resettle-gaza-at-ultra-nationalist-rally/\">called for the Jewish settlement </a>of Gaza.</p> <p>You cannot evade the demands of international law to protect civilians by arbitrarily designating them as combatants. For a year, families have been forced <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002412q\">from one place to another,</a> only to find further danger. Mr Dalou\u2019s family had been <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/heartbreaking-story-behind-video-of-young-man-burnt-to-death-in-medical-compound-after-israeli-strike-13234035\">displaced at least five times</a> before his death. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck in a never\u2011ending nightmare,\u201d he wrote earlier this year.</p> <p>The US has issued arguably its starkest warning yet to Israel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/us-israel-weapons-gaza-aid-letter\">making clear</a> that arms transfers could be withheld if it did not allow more aid into northern Gaza. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told the security council that a \u201cquote-unquote \u2018policy of starvation\u2019 \u2026 would be horrific and unacceptable\u201d. Yet every time the US lays down a marker, Israel ignores it \u2013 and the US continues to supply both arms and diplomatic cover. The deadline set by Washington expires after the US election. Perhaps as an outgoing president, Joe Biden might rethink his unabating support for Israel.

      "bodyText": "The Israeli military\u2019s announcement that it has killed the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar should be an opportunity to end the devastating war in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinian men, women and children. The death of the man who masterminded the 7 October massacres in southern Israel that killed more than 1,200 people would mark a key moment in the conflict. It could renew momentum for a ceasefire deal and hostage release \u2013 as families of those held have demanded. With the group\u2019s two other key figures already dead, Benjamin Netanyahu could declare victory. There is no sign that he is prepared to do so without intense and sustained pressure on him \u2013 the sort of pressure that the US has repeatedly been unwilling to exert. Mr Netanyahu knows that protracting conflict extends his political life. It seems more likely that he will vow that it\u2019s time to finish the job. The Israeli prime minister said last month\u2019s killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, had \u201csettled the score\u201d, and his approval ratings rose. Then Israel launched its ground offensive in Lebanon. Yet as attention moved to the northern front, the conflict in Gaza intensified. The horror of seeing the teenager Shaban al-Dalou burned to death due to an Israeli strike on a hospital compound seized international attention. But many more face deaths no less cruel. The UN says that 345,000 people face \u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels of hunger in the coming months, and almost all of the 2 million population face \u201cacute food insecurity\u201d, with barely any food entering in the last fortnight. This looks like \u201cthe generals\u2019 plan\u201d \u2013 a blueprint for human rights violations drawn up by retired military figures. Mr Netanyahu said he was considering it, and both human rights groups and Israeli personnel say that they believe it is already under way. It calls for the besieging of northern Gaza; all civilians would be told to leave and the military would assume that those remaining were terrorists and cut off all supplies. In the longer term, ministers have already called for the Jewish settlement of Gaza. You cannot evade the demands of international law to protect civilians by arbitrarily designating them as combatants. For a year, families have been forced from one place to another, only to find further danger. Mr Dalou\u2019s family had been displaced at least five times before his death. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck in a never\u2011ending nightmare,\u201d he wrote earlier this year. The US has issued arguably its starkest warning yet to Israel, making clear that arms transfers could be withheld if it did not allow more aid into northern Gaza. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told the security council that a \u201cquote-unquote \u2018policy of starvation\u2019 \u2026 would be horrific and unacceptable\u201d. Yet every time the US lays down a marker, Israel ignores it \u2013 and the US continues to supply both arms and diplomatic cover. The deadline set by Washington expires after the US election. Perhaps as an outgoing president, Joe Biden might rethink his unabating support for Israel. But he has shown no signs of it so far \u2013 and the people of Gaza cannot wait. The resumption and acceleration of aid flows are crucial but insufficient. People are not only hungry, malnourished and ailing but exhausted and traumatised. A ceasefire and hostage release deal is no less essential for its current unlikelihood. Pressure from European nations might encourage the US to do the right thing. They should include not only a halt to arms supplies but also the imposition of sanctions on Mr Netanyahu\u2019s extremist coalition partners Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who said it might be \u201cjust and moral\u201d to starve Palestinians in Gaza until hostages were released. This opportunity must not be ignored.",

However, campaigners have questioned why the BNPL changes will not take effect until 2026, warning that consumers need to be \u201cwary\u201d in the meantime. In recent years the market for BNPL has boomed, with many big retailers teaming up with lenders such as Klarna and Clearpay to allow consumers to spread the cost of their purchases. But while the loans, typically advertised at online checkouts, do not attract interest, concerns have grown around the ease with which borrowers can build up unaffordable debt. Research carried out last year by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that 14 million people had used BNPL and frequent users were more than four times as likely to have recently missed a payment for a bill or credit commitment than those who had not used the loans. The Treasury said its new rules would allow the FCA to force BNPL companies to undertake affordability checks on would-be borrowers before people could sign up for a loan. Bringing the sector under the financial watchdog\u2019s authority and applying the Consumer Credit Act to it will mean companies will need to provide clear, simple and accessible information about loan agreements so that shoppers can make fully informed decisions and understand the risks associated with late repayments.

      "body": "<p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is exploring ways to raise billions of pounds extra in taxes at the budget.</p> <p>Labour outlined about \u00a39bn worth of tax-raising measures in its manifesto, but also committed not to increase taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d using the three biggest revenue-raisers for the Treasury: income tax, national insurance and VAT. The party also committed to not increasing corporation tax on businesses.</p> <p>However, Reeves has said she was keen to avoid a \u201creturn to austerity\u201d under the new government, and told cabinet colleagues that meeting this pledge could force her to raise more in taxes than originally planned.</p> <p>The chancellor has warned that a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances \u2013 which Labour claims it inherited from the Conservatives \u2013 will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/15/rachel-reeves-tells-cabinet-uk-still-faces-100bn-black-hole-over-next-five-years\">persist over the next five years</a>, forcing the new government to take \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d on spending, welfare and tax.</p> <p>Reeves is aiming to make \u00a340bn worth of tax rises and spending cuts a year to overcome the shortfall, in order to meet her \u201cgolden rule\u201d of balancing day-to-day spending with tax receipts. This would help to avoid a fresh round of cuts to departmental budgets.</p> <p>Here are the tax raising options under consideration:</p> <h2>Capital gains tax</h2> <p>Reeves has been exploring a rise in capital gains tax (CGT) since before the general election, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/06/rachel-reeves-under-pressure-from-shadow-ministers-to-raise-capital-gains-tax-to-revive-public-services\">revealed by the Guardian</a>. About \u00a315bn a year is raised, paid by about 350,000 people each year \u2013 and the majority coming from a small subset of super-rich individuals.</p> <p>CGT is levied on the increase in the value of an asset in the period between its purchase and disposal. Various rates apply on the sale of different assets, including residential property, shares and carried interest earned by private equity fund managers.</p> <p>At present, the top rate of income tax is 45%, but most types of capital gain are taxed at 20% and can be as low as 10%.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is exploring ways to raise billions of pounds extra in taxes at the budget. Labour outlined about \u00a39bn worth of tax-raising measures in its manifesto, but also committed not to increase taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d using the three biggest revenue-raisers for the Treasury: income tax, national insurance and VAT. The party also committed to not increasing corporation tax on businesses. However, Reeves has said she was keen to avoid a \u201creturn to austerity\u201d under the new government, and told cabinet colleagues that meeting this pledge could force her to raise more in taxes than originally planned. The chancellor has warned that a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances \u2013 which Labour claims it inherited from the Conservatives \u2013 will persist over the next five years, forcing the new government to take \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d on spending, welfare and tax. Reeves is aiming to make \u00a340bn worth of tax rises and spending cuts a year to overcome the shortfall, in order to meet her \u201cgolden rule\u201d of balancing day-to-day spending with tax receipts. This would help to avoid a fresh round of cuts to departmental budgets. Here are the tax raising options under consideration: Capital gains tax Reeves has been exploring a rise in capital gains tax (CGT) since before the general election, as revealed by the Guardian. About \u00a315bn a year is raised, paid by about 350,000 people each year \u2013 and the majority coming from a small subset of super-rich individuals. CGT is levied on the increase in the value of an asset in the period between its purchase and disposal. Various rates apply on the sale of different assets, including residential property, shares and carried interest earned by private equity fund managers. At present, the top rate of income tax is 45%, but most types of capital gain are taxed at 20% and can be as low as 10%. The chancellor could raise up to \u00a314bn by bringing the rates into line with income tax bands, but she could opt for a narrower set of changes to raise about \u00a38bn. Non-dom tax reforms Labour\u2019s manifesto included measures to raise \u00a35.2bn in extra revenue from closing further loopholes in the non-dom tax regime, building on changes made by Jeremy Hunt in the March 2024 budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that scrapping the tax break for wealthy foreigners could raise about \u00a33.2bn a year, but warned this was a \u201chighly uncertain\u201d figure as the super-rich could either leave Britain or find ways to avoid the tax. It emerged last month that Treasury officials feared Labour\u2019s additional measures could end up losing the exchequer \u00a31bn, rather than bringing in more money. It is thought the chancellor is reconsidering her plans. Inheritance tax About \u00a38bn a year is raised by inheritance tax, with the levy typically paid on the estates of about 5% of annual deaths \u2013 the wealthiest estates in Britain. The chancellor could close several loopholes. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has suggested bringing pension pots into scope, and ending business and agricultural reliefs, to raise up to \u00a32bn. Reeves could go further by ending the complicated residence nil-band rate, introduced in 2017, which provides an extra tax-free allowance if a main residence is left to a direct descendent. This could raise a further \u00a32bn. Employer national insurance contributions There are two options for the chancellor. First, levying employer national insurance contributions (NICs) on pensions contributions. The Resolution Foundation estimates this could raise \u00a318bn, but because it would also hit public-sector employers, they would need to be reimbursed \u2013 reducing the net gain to about \u00a312bn. The second would be a straightforward increase in the rate of NICs paid by employers. Employers pay NICs for most workers earning more than \u00a39,100 a year, paying the equivalent of 13.8% on earnings above the threshold. HM Revenue and Customs estimates a one percentage point increase in the rate would bring in almost \u00a39bn by 2027-28. The chancellor has strongly hinted she could do this. However, she has faced criticism that this could break Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge, with warnings workers would ultimately pay the price through lower wages. Reeves could, though, argue that businesses, not \u201cworking people\u201d, would shoulder the cost. \u2018Sin\u2019 taxes Ministers are understood to be considering a tax increase of up to \u00a33bn on the gambling sector, after a report by the centre-left IPPR thinktank suggested the move in September among key recommendations for tackling Britain\u2019s health challenges. Fuel duty Successive Conservative chancellors have frozen fuel duty since 2011, handing a generous tax break to motorists, while depriving the exchequer of a total of about \u00a3100bn in foregone revenue. Rishi Sunak also launched a temporary 5p fuel duty cut in 2022 to address the cost of living crisis, which has been extended twice and is due to expire in March next year. The default government position is that the temporary cut ends and fuel duty will rise in line with retail price inflation next spring. For this reason, allowing a rise wouldn\u2019t help to plug the chancellor\u2019s forecast budget deficit \u2013 because the OBR already assumes the tax rate will go back up automatically. Reeves is under heavy pressure to freeze the rate from motoring groups. But doing so would come at a serious cost. Cancelling the scheduled rises would be worth \u00a34.8bn, according to the Resolution Foundation. What Reeves won\u2019t do Although Labour has complained of a dire economic inheritance from the Conservatives, there is one measure in particular Reeves will be quietly thankful for. Her legacy included planning tax rises between 2025 and 2027 that add up to \u00a324bn a year through the freezing of income tax and national insurance thresholds. Known as \u201cfiscal drag\u201d, the thresholds would normally increase in line with inflation in-year. Because they don\u2019t, there is a windfall for the exchequer. Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge not to increase income tax, national insurance and VAT makes it politically challenging for the chancellor to touch the three biggest revenue-raising taxes for the exchequer. The previous government\u2019s 4p cut in national insurance cost the exchequer about \u00a320bn, which Labour has not said it would reverse. Increasing income tax by 1p would raise almost \u00a37.5bn on the basic rate in 2027-28, while for the higher and additional rates it would raise \u00a32bn and \u00a3210m.",

      "bodyText": "A childminder married to a Conservative councillor has been jailed after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire after the Southport attacks. Lucy Connolly, 41, received a 31-month prison sentence after calling for \u201cmass deportation now\u201d in a social media post to her 10,000 followers on X on the day three children were killed in a knife attack in Southport. In the expletive-ridden message she said \u201cset fire to all the fucking hotels full of the bastards for all I care\u201d and concluded \u201cif that makes me racist so be it\u201d. The post was later deleted but police established it was available for at least three and a half hours. In September, she pleaded guilty to writing a social media post intending to stir up racial hatred and was sentenced at Birmingham crown court on Thursday. Judge Melbourne Inman KC said Connolly was \u201cwell aware of how volatile the situation was\u201d at the time of the Southport attack, volatility that led to serious disorder in a number of areas. \u201cYour message was widely read \u2013 it was viewed 310,000 times with 940 reposts, 58 quotes and 113 bookmarks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst I accept you regret your actions \u2026 it is clear from the evidence of your own words in the days following your actions, what you said to the police and what you said to the probation officer that you have little insight into, or acceptance of, your actions.\u201d The court heard that the day before Connolly was arrested, she sent a WhatsApp message saying the \u201craging tweet about burning down hotels has bit me on the arse lol\u201d. She also said she would \u201cplay the mental health card\u201d if arrested, and would deny responsibility for the post if asked. Naeem Valli, prosecuting, said Connolly, who has no previous conviction, also sent a message saying she intended to work her notice period as a childminder \u201con the sly\u201d despite being deregistered. She also sent another tweet commenting on a sword attack that read: \u201cI bet my house it was one of these boat invaders.\u201d Tom Muir, defending, said: \u201cWhatever her intention was in posting the offending tweet, it was short-lived, and she didn\u2019t expect the violence that followed, and she quickly tried to quell it.\u201d Connolly is married to Raymond Connolly, a Conservative councillor for West Northamptonshire council, who watched from the public gallery as his wife was sentenced. He had previously told reporters he would not resign over the matter, adding that it had been \u201cquite traumatic for Lucy and the children\u201d. Connolly was ordered to serve 40% of her 31-month sentence in prison before being released on licence. Her sentence was handed down on the same day that a Staffordshire man, convicted of rioting in connection with post-Southport unrest, was jailed for six years and 17 weeks. Simon Orr, 39, of Tamworth, was sentenced at Stafford crown court on Thursday, after pleading guilty to charges of riot and assaulting a female police officer, police said. Orr, who was the third defendant in England to admit a charge of riot in connection with disorder around the country, also sent a WhatsApp message encouraging others to turn up during an attack on a hotel in Tamworth on 4 August. The police said: \u201cOrr was arrested on 12 August and originally denied his involvement, saying the protest was peaceful. \u201cWe secured the evidence to charge him for violent disorder and later consulted with the CPS over upgrading the offence to riot \u2013 unlawful violence \u2013 public order, the most serious of the Public Order Act 1986. \u201cIn September, we became the second force in the UK to secure riot charges against two people, including Orr. \u201cAlongside his sentencing today, we also reached a milestone of making 150 arrests in connection with both disorders in Stoke-on-Trent and Tamworth.

Well we still could do with a close finish but we\u2019ve had a couple of big shocks, courtesy of turbo-charged displays from West Indies on Tuesday and now South Africa tonight. The serial champions and holders Australia are heading home, and this tournament is now tantalisingly hard to call. South Africa did everything right today, and another showing like that in the final could finally land them a trophy. Thanks for following.

Welcome to the latest episode in what consensus has it is Australia\u2019s procession to another World T20 title. South Africa stand in their way today, having put together some commanding wins in the group stage, bar their fairly convincing defeat by England. But Heather Knight\u2019s increasingly brittle side messed up at the last and have gone home.</p> <p>All of which leaves the Proteas as probably the second strongest of the semi-finalists, with their leading talents \u2013 such as Laura Woolvaardt and Tamzin Brits with the bat, the effective left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba with the ball and the always dangerous all-rounder Marizanne Kapp \u2013 all in decent nick, they should pose Australia their biggest challenge of the tournament so far.</p> <p>For the holders have been formidable, twice bowling opponents out in under 20 overs and even in their narrowest win, over India, they never lost control. There\u2019s match-winners everywhere you look down their line-up, even when key players are injured. One such, Alyssa Healy, was still doubtful overnight having picked up a foot injury against Pakistan but the Australia camp say they want to give her as much time as possible to declare herself fit to play in Dubai today. And the fact that Dubai, the best of the surfaces used in the tournament, is today\u2019s venue gives us hope for some decent scoring rates in what has been a low-scoring competition.</p> <p>These sides met in the final of the last World T20, of course, where home advantage didn\u2019t count for enough for South Africa, and Australia carved out a 19-run victory, because that\u2019s what they do.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be under way at 3pm BST/6pm local time/1am AET. Stick around.</p> </div>   </div>",

Well we still could do with a close finish but we\u2019ve had a couple of big shocks, courtesy of turbo-charged displays from West Indies on Tuesday and now South Africa tonight. The serial champions and holders Australia are heading home, and this tournament is now tantalisingly hard to call. South Africa did everything right today, and another showing like that in the final could finally land them a trophy. Thanks for following. Bye. Then up steps a beaming Laura Wolvaardt: \u201cI think it\u2019s right up there with one of the best wins of my career for sure,\u201d she surely understates. \u201cIt was such an amazing chase \u2013 Anneka batted excellently, the bowlers excellent too. It\u2019s been a real collective group effort. With them being the side they are we spent time analysing them for weakness, and perhaps we did that a bit more than other teams. We didn\u2019t have the best first two overs and Taz and I had a chat and said we had to put our feet down a little and then Anneka came out and did what she had to do \u2013 one of the standouts of her career and what a time to bring it out.\u201d As for their potential final opponents? \u201cWest Indies look dangerous at the moment but you can never count out [New Zealand\u2019s Amelia] Kerr and [Sophie] Devine The captains speak. First up, Tahlia McGrath: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to take,\u201d admits the Australia captain, \u201cwe just didn\u2019t really show up and you can\u2019t afford to do that, and full credit to South Africa \u2013 they outplaed us tonight and we weren\u2019t at our best. We\u2019ve had this World Cup in our minds for a long time, we were well prepped and felt like we left no stone unturned but just didn\u2019t show up tonight. \u201cWe found it quite tricky out there and South Africa bowled really well \u2013 they took the pace off nicely, made it hard to take risks. We thought it might be a par score but South Africa made it look like a different wicket and batted really well. We were trying to keep it really simple but were off our best and got punished.\u201d She remains confident in her players though, from veterans to youngsters. \u201cMegan Schutt has been huge this tournament and always leads from the front and some of our youngsters in Bels [Annabel Sutherland] and Phoebes [Litchfield] show us the future\u2019s bright.\u201d Anneke Bosch is unsurprisingly named player of the match. \u201cMy heart is racing a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was quite tough out there and am glad we could get over the line and that I could finally contribute some runs. Me and Laura out there talked about keeping it simple, not overthinking, playing with the conditions and sticking to what we know.\u201d Praise too for the pre-match pep talks of bowling consultant Paul Adams: \u201cHis speeches help us before the game and psyche us up. I can\u2019t really describe what it means but we knew we were capable of it.\u201d This really is a huge result. South Africa didn\u2019t just beat the serial world champions; they comprehensively outplayed them, bowling with nous, control and intelligence, then batting with controlled aggression, making the world\u2019s best bowling attack look toothless. They\u2019re in a second consecutive final. 17.2 overs: South Africa 135-2 (Bosch 74, Tryon 1); target 135. Schutt\u2019s death bowling skills will surely not be enough here as she returns to the attack. And they\u2019re not, a full toss is cracked to the deep midwicket boundary for four to complete an astonishing, brilliant victory. AUSTRALIA HAVE LOST AN ACTUAL GAME OF TOURNAMENT CRICKET 17th over: South Africa 131-2 (Bosch 70, Tryon 1); target 135. Sutherland begins her over with perhaps the best ball of the innings, a searingly accurate yorker aimed at middle that is well dug out by Bosch, who responds by carving a nervelessly excellent shot through the offside for four. A single follows, giving Bosch her highest T20 score and the highest of the whole tournament. Tryon is off the mark with a swiped single. One more brings the target down to just four more needed. 16th over: South Africa 124-2 (Bosch 64, Tryon 0); target 135. Molineux returns, producing Bosch\u2019s first dot ball for 22 deliveries. But she gets a single reaching for a sweep across the line. Tryon looks slightly troubled by Molineux, surviving an lbw appeal. Only three from the over but only 11 needed. 15th over: South Africa 121-2 (Bosch 61); target 135. Australia stay alert in the field but five singles off Sutherland\u2019s first five suit SA just fine. But then Wolvaardt perishes. That was South Africa\u2019s highest ever T20 partnership for any wicket against Australia, 96. The captain miscues a slower ball to mid-off where McGrath takes an easy catch. A turning point, or too late 14th over: South Africa 116-1 (Wolvaardt 40, Bosch 58); target 135. McGrath brings herself on, a wayward full-bunger wide rather summing up Australia\u2019s current predicament, but the Australia captain\u2019s over is otherwise tight, as it has to be, but not tight enough, for South Africa need only 19 to win from 36 balls. 13th over: South Africa 108-1 (Wolvaardt 37, Bosch 55); target 135. Dare I use the word carnage? Wolvaardt sweeps Gardner for four to make this the best partnership against Australia all tournament. Bosch too finds the boundary, following the spin and easing a sweep for four. This is such good batting. Bosch brings up her 50, off 31 balls, with a crack through the covers for two. Then, an audacious lofted reverse sweep for four. 12th over: South Africa 93-1 (Wolvaardt 32, Bosch 45); target 135. Wareham has a long conflab with McGrath before beginning her second over, her first having gone for 10. The spinner is more on the money now, tucking Wolvaardt up nicely but not being so fortunate with Bosch, who swings cleanly over midwicket for four \u2013 and then betters it with a similar shot that goes further and higher for SIX. Over the long boundary. She\u2019s hit her best form of the tournament here, by miles 11th over: South Africa 81-1 (Wolvaardt 31, Bosch 34); target 135. A Bosch single into the legside off Schutt brings up the 50 partnership. Wolvaardt then essays a risky swipe into the legside that eludes fielders and plugs in the turf a touch, but it all keeps the scoreboard ticking over. Four singles precede a lovely deft reverse sweep lofted towards third man for two by Bosch. Australia\u2019s attack just doesn\u2019t look as threatening as it usually does. 10th over: South Africa 74-1 (Wolvaardt 29, Bosch 29); target 135. McGrath continues to rotate her pack, restoring Molineux to the attack. The middle-overs-meandering continues with three singles. Both these batters are still trying to welly it but for now finding fielders. Five from the over. Drinks. 9th over: South Africa 69-1 (Wolvaardt 27, Bosch 26); target 135. Sutherland returns, the boundaries dry up, but the Proteas don\u2019t need to force the pace too much at present. An over of ones and twos is OK for now. They\u2019re more than halfway to their target. Nervous much? 8th over: South Africa 63-1 (Wolvaardt 25, Bosch 22); target 135. Now Wareham comes on to bowl, but still the Protean aggression continues, Bosch biffing a lofted drive, reading the spin, high down the ground for four more. A neat swivel pull for two ensues as Australia just can\u2019t stem the flow of runs. But they do have a shout for lbw as Bosch misses one that goes on. It\u2019s turned down but reviewed \u2013 with reason, it looked close \u2013 but it\u2019s missing off. Australia lose a review. 7th over: South Africa 53-1 (Wolvaardt 24, Bosch 13); target 135. Darcie Brown is the fifth Australia bowler used, as McGrath brings some pace back into the attack. Bosch slightly miscues a pull but it\u2019s beyond midwicket and brings one more. Then Wolvaardt cleanly hammers a straight accurate ball from Brown back over her and everyone else\u2019s head for a gorgeous SIX. The Proteas captain is leading from the front at the moment. 6th over: South Africa 43-1 (Wolvaardt 16, Bosch 11); target 135. Sophie Molineux\u2019s left-arm spin comes into the attack, and her first ball is swept high and unconvincingly by Bosch but it lands safely. The bowler will not be discouraged by that. Bosch connects rather more cleanly off her third ball, and it sails to the square leg boundary for four. And the next is cracked over mid-off for four more. A confident end to the powerplay by South Africa. Australia were 35-2 at this stage. Just saying. 5th over: South Africa 33-1 (Wolvaardt 16, Bosch 1); target 135. Sutherland is into the attack and strikes first ball \u2013 a big breakthrough. Sutherland tightens the screw, until Wolvaardt swings a slower ball over midwicket and it gathers pace along the ground to reach the ropes. Two more complete a lively over. Sutherland strikes with her first ball, a brilliant back of a length ball that\u2019s aimed at top of off, and hits top of off. 4th over: South Africa 25-0 (Wolvaardt 10, Brits 15); target 135. Gardner\u2019s started very well, offering nothing and still finding flight and spin, but after two dots she\u2019s launched over the top by Brits for SIX \u2013 just \u2013 as the fielder in the deep, Sutherland, can only parry it over the ropes. A single and a two follow in another productive Proteas over. The South Africa openers are now clear as the top two run-scorers in the competition 3rd over: South Africa 16-0 (Wolvaardt 8, Brits 8); target 135. Clever batting from Wolvaardt who steers a wide ball from Schutt over the offside in-field for two, and follows it with an easy single. Then a fumble on the long-off boundary from Sutherland gifts SA their first boundary after an elegantly struck lofted drive by Brits. Another four follows when Wolvaardt edges a decent ball beyond the keeper and it skids away to the ropes. South Africa are up and running. 2nd over: South Africa 4-0 (Wolvaardt 1, Brits 3); target 135. Unlike the Proteas, Australia don\u2019t go for all-seam openers, tossing Ash Gardner the ball. Brits advances and clobbers her first ball down the ground for two. She can hit the ball very hard, but mostly \u2013 in this over \u2013 to fielders, in five consecutive dot balls. Just a hint of Brits showing early frustration. 1st over: South Africa 2-0 (Wolvaardt 1, Brits 1); target 135. Megan Schutt opens up for Australia, finding plenty of movement through the air. A couple of singles are all that South Africa can muster off a tidy first over. This is a time for cool, confident heads. So, a competitive total in the end for Australia, but a certainly reachable one for South Africa, whose generally smart bowling showed why they\u2019re more merited semi-finalists than England. It\u2019s beautifully set up for the chase that South Africa opted for on winning the toss, having twice beaten Australia chasing earlier this year. Back in a bit. Go nowhere. 20th over: Australia 134-5 (Perry 31, Litchfield 16*). Khaka bowls the final over and starts it with a magnificent slow yorker \u2013 a valuable dot ball. Then another full one that can only be carved away for one by Litchfield, but Perry\u2019s a wily campaigner and she advances to power a straight drive down the ground for four. Two more twos ensue before a wide prolongs the innings. But the last ball is a wicket, Perry connects cleanly swinging towards deep midwicket but this time Brits holds on, and holds on well. 19th over: Australia 124-4 (Perry 23, Litchfield 15). De Klerk gets the penultimate over, from which four singles are followed by a drop from Perry\u2019s high off-drive that Brits spills. That looked pretty regulation. Perry then rubs salt in the wounds with a crisp cover drive for four. One over to go, and this partnership looks useful already. 18th over: Australia 114-4 (Perry 15, Litchfield 13). Mlaba continues to ask questions in her final over, Perry miscuing a drive but still getting two when she wanted four. Litchfield has no such problems, creaming a lofted off-drive for four, and hacking the next, slower ball for four more. Superb batting, which could make all the difference for Australia in these death overs. 17th over: Australia 103-4 (Perry 13, Litchfield 4). Given this pair\u2019s ability against spin, Wolvaardt turns to seam again, and Kapp\u2019s final over. Mooney continues to power this innings, cracking a fierce two, before running herself out. In comes the aggressive Litchfield, who\u2019s off the mark with a firm square drive for four. A biggie! The opener advances to drive a full toss, sets off for a single that\u2019s not on, Kapp throws down the stumps and an umpire\u2019s review confirms she\u2019s a goner. 16th over: Australia 94-3 (Mooney 42, Perry 10). Mooney cracks Tryon for another one-bounce drive for a single \u2013 soon one of these will find a fielder\u2019s hands surely \u2013 but not yet. Mooney finds the boundary at last, almost holing out to Kapp at deep midwicket but she can\u2019t quite reach it and it\u2019s four. Tryon ends with figures of 4-0-25-0 and Beth Mooney becomes the quickest woman to 3,000 T20i runs. 15th over: Australia 86-3 (Mooney 36, Perry 8). Perry tries to hit Mlaba over the top but only finds long-off after one bounce as boundaries continue to elude Australia, Mooney doing likewise and cover-driving along the ground for two. She\u2019s got such smart variations of pace and length though, Mlaba, making it harder for batters to pre-execute. Another Mooney slog brings two, before Perry rounds off the over with another swipe towards long-off that bounces between three fielders. They\u2019ll be pleased to have kept the scoreboard ticking during that over but Australia wanted more. 14th over: Australia 78-3 (Mooney 31, Perry 5). Mooney loves a firm pull shot, and essays one with force off Tryon, but the Proteas have women out on the legside boundary to minimise the damage. Perry offers Wolvaardt a half-chance at backward point and she lands awkwardly while trying and failing to reach it. She\u2019s OK though. Tryon then reviews for lbw after striking an advancing Mooney on the pad, but it\u2019s pitched outside leg. Review burned. But SA will be pleased at the level of control they currently have, and just the odd hint of desperation in their opponents. 13th over: Australia 72-3 (Mooney 28, Perry 3). The partnership is ended by clever bowling from Mlaba, bringing to the crease Perry, who\u2019s off the mark with a high drive for two. It\u2019s an over full of variation and challenges, and yields only four, plus an all-important wicket. Brilliant cricket. Mlaba does it again, returning to the attack and foxing McGrath with a slower back of a length ball that the Australia captain dollies up to backward point. 12th over: Australia 68-2 (Mooney 27, McGrath 27). The Proteas revert to Seam, and Khaka, but Australia keep the scoreboard whirring, McGrath almost offering De Klerk a chance at mid-off but it drops short and bounces painfully into her shin. The 50 partnership is brought up; its eventual size could be pivotal to the outcome. 11th over: Australia 62-2 (Mooney 25, McGrath 23). The cameras pan over, as they oftendo, to Dubai rush-hour traffic, prompting me to mull over geopolitics and working conditions (I\u2019m proper fun at parties, me). Out in the middle, Mooney continues to look Australia\u2019s most comfortable batter, playing balls on their merits and looking to score. McGrath needs to match that, and now she does with a belted four off a short Luus delivery that races to the deep point boundary. Just a sign of shackles coming off there. SA need a wicket. 10th over: Australia 53-2 (Mooney 21, McGrath 18). At last, Australia release some pressure, Mooney advancing to Tryon and lofting a drive down the ground for four. Australia pass 50, their slowest first 50 of the tournament, but it\u2019s still their most profitable over since the end of the powerplay. At the halfway stage, South Africa will be fractionally happier. They\u2019ve bowled very well. Drinks. 9th over: Australia 44-2 (Mooney 15, McGrath 15). All spin now as Luus comes on early (for her), and nearly induces McGrath to play on with a miscued slogsweep. Australia continue to struggle to cut loose, but South Africa could do with a wicket to reward their economy. You don\u2019t want to leave these two batters out there too long. 8th over: Australia 42-2 (Mooney 14, McGrath 14). Some different left-arm spin now, from Chloe Tryon. McGrath is itching to take her on but her middle/leg-stump line stifles such notions. Tryon also bamboozles McGrath with a beauty full of turn and bounce that rips past her outside edge, reading and foiling the batter\u2019s intentions. Excellent stuff. 7th over: Australia 39-2 (Mooney 13, McGrath 12). Nadine de Klerk is introduced, keeper standing up. The batters deal in ones and twos in a tight over. Nicely poised this, at the moment. 6th over: Australia 35-2 (Mooney 10, McGrath 11). Spin now, and the in-form Mlaba gets the final over of the powerplay. Her first ball is an unpunished half-tracker, but her third is cracked to the extra cover boundary by the Australia captain for four. Mlabab responds by tucking her up a bit more, inducing a risky swivel-pull that almost finds the fielder at square leg but McGrath hammers the final ball of the power play square on the off for four. Australia\u2019s most promising over thus far, led by the skipper. 5th over: Australia 27-2 (Mooney 10, McGrath 3). Better from Mooney, who straight drives Kapp breezily down the ground for two. I was about to say this is good measured stuff from Australia before Mooney miscues a drive that almost finds the hand of the fielder at point. It\u2019s another fine over from Kapp all told \u2013 she likes this ground. One over of the powerplay left for Australia to find those gaps. 4th over: Australia 23-2 (Mooney 7, McGrath 2). Mooney and the captain, McGrath, get a single each as Khaka continues and the Proteas quicks continue to apply powerplay pressure, but this pair do a decent job of at least keeping the scoreboard moving and the strike rotating. 3rd over: Australia 18-2 (Mooney 4). Mooney seizes her first chance to be expansive, square-driving firmly to the long boundary for three off Kapp. The first boundary off the bat comes via a free hit Kapp presents to Georgia Wareham who swipes to the deep midwicket boundary for four. But other than that Kapp is finding a good testing length that keeps the batter honest, and then beats Wareham with an outswinger that prompts a rejected appeal for a catch behind, which is reviewed. And rightly so. Wareham\u2019s gone, there was an edge. This is excellent from South Africa. 2nd over: Australia 10-1 (Mooney 1, Wareham 1). Seam at both ends, and it works. Khaka dismissing Harris with her first delivery. Australia punt Wareham up the order, who gets off the mark with a single. There\u2019s definite swing in the air, and Mooney is watchful against a bowler who\u2019s had success against left-handers in this tournament. This is, in this very early stage, a promising start for the Proteas. Khaka strikes with her first ball, Harris cutting low to backward point and Bosch scooping up a fine catch. 1st over: Australia 7-0 (Harris 3 Mooney 0). Seam up first with the mighty Marizanne Kapp taking the new ball in the dusky light, and she beats Harris with an away-swinger straight away. This is why they back their bowlers to go first. Harris responds by moving in front of off and gets Australia on the board with a dinky little ramp to fine leg for two. A single (despite Harris wanting to come back for a second) is followed by four byes as what looked like an inside edge zips through Jafta\u2019s fingers behind the stumps. A rather gorgeous sunset is visible on the skyline as the teams stride out for the anthems, amid the usual fireworky shenanigans. And the anthems ring out in fairly operatic style. Let\u2019s go \u2026 Alyssa Healy \u201ccontinues to be assessed daily\u201d, according to the Australia camp, so could return for any final appearance. Australia: Grace Harris, Beth Mooney \u2020, Tahlia McGrath (c), Ellyse Perry, Ashleigh Gardner, Phoebe Litchfield, Georgia Wareham, Annabel Sutherland, Sophie Molineux, Megan Schutt, Darcie Brown South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Tazmin Brits, Anneke Bosch, Marizanne Kapp, Chloe Tryon, Sune Luus, Annerie Dercksen, Nadine de Klerk, Sinalo Jafta \u2020, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Ayabonga Khaka Laura Wolvaardt fancies a chase and doesn\u2019t hesitate to field first when the coin lands the right side up. South Africa field an unchanged side. \u201cHopefully we can catch them off guard,\u201d she says. Tahlia McGrath is happy enough to bat first, get to 160-170 and apply some scoreboard pressure. The Aussie captain confirms Healy\u2019s absence as they too go with the same XI that played India in their last game. Earlier in the week, before West Indies\u2019 spectacular display against England, Raf Nicholson wrote an insightful summary of what we\u2019ve learned from the tournament so far. Tuck in while we wait for the toss: Is the UAE the spinner\u2019s paradise we were all led to believe? Five of the top 10 leading wicket-takers in the tournament so far are seamers \u2013 including Australia\u2019s Megan Schutt (eight wickets) and Annabel Sutherland (seven). When Australia v India came down to the wire on Sunday, with India needing 14 runs from the final over, it was Sutherland who the stand-in captain Tahlia McGrath turned to. The all-rounder was the embodiment of composure, giving away only five runs (while taking two wickets) as Australia held firm. Afternoon/evening/(very early) morning everyone. Welcome to the latest episode in what consensus has it is Australia\u2019s procession to another World T20 title. South Africa stand in their way today, having put together some commanding wins in the group stage, bar their fairly convincing defeat by England. But Heather Knight\u2019s increasingly brittle side messed up at the last and have gone home. All of which leaves the Proteas as probably the second strongest of the semi-finalists, with their leading talents \u2013 such as Laura Woolvaardt and Tamzin Brits with the bat, the effective left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba with the ball and the always dangerous all-rounder Marizanne Kapp \u2013 all in decent nick, they should pose Australia their biggest challenge of the tournament so far. For the holders have been formidable, twice bowling opponents out in under 20 overs and even in their narrowest win, over India, they never lost control. There\u2019s match-winners everywhere you look down their line-up, even when key players are injured. One such, Alyssa Healy, was still doubtful overnight having picked up a foot injury against Pakistan but the Australia camp say they want to give her as much time as possible to declare herself fit to play in Dubai today. And the fact that Dubai, the best of the surfaces used in the tournament, is today\u2019s venue gives us hope for some decent scoring rates in what has been a low-scoring competition. These sides met in the final of the last World T20, of course, where home advantage didn\u2019t count for enough for South Africa, and Australia carved out a 19-run victory, because that\u2019s what they do. We\u2019ll be under way at 3pm BST/6pm local time/1am AET. Stick around.",

      "body": "<p>The European Central Bank has intervened to prevent a sharp slowdown in the eurozone economy with its first back-to-back interest rate cut since the euro crisis in 2011.</p> <p>With Germany on the brink of a recession and inflation tumbling across the 20 member single currency bloc, the ECB followed a reduction in the cost of borrowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/12/economic-growth-in-eurozone-will-be-weaker-than-hoped-says-ecb\">at its previous meeting in September</a> with a further 0.25 percentage point cut in its key deposit rate to 3.25%.</p> <p>Marking the third interest rate cut this year, the ECB\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said the fall in inflation had surprised the central bank and meant a cut was needed to ensure a soft landing for the eurozone economy.</p> <p>Figures out earlier on Thursday revealed annual prices growth in the eurozone had eased in September to 1.7%, down from 2.2% the previous month.</p> <p>Lagarde said there were clear signs from most measures of business and consumer activity that the economy was weakening.</p> <p>Growth in France is expected to wane after a bounce during the Olympics while Italy\u2019s better than expected recovery from the inflation shock of the last two years has petered out.

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has intervened to prevent a sharp slowdown in the eurozone economy with its first back-to-back interest rate cut since the euro crisis in 2011. With Germany on the brink of a recession and inflation tumbling across the 20 member single currency bloc, the ECB followed a reduction in the cost of borrowing at its previous meeting in September with a further 0.25 percentage point cut in its key deposit rate to 3.25%. Marking the third interest rate cut this year, the ECB\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said the fall in inflation had surprised the central bank and meant a cut was needed to ensure a soft landing for the eurozone economy. Figures out earlier on Thursday revealed annual prices growth in the eurozone had eased in September to 1.7%, down from 2.2% the previous month. Lagarde said there were clear signs from most measures of business and consumer activity that the economy was weakening. Growth in France is expected to wane after a bounce during the Olympics while Italy\u2019s better than expected recovery from the inflation shock of the last two years has petered out. Only Spain has shown a degree of resilience while interest rates have remained high, increasing by 0.8% in the second quarter of the year. Earlier this month, an measure of factory output in the eurozone \u2013 the HCOB Manufacturing PMI \u2013 fell to a nine-month low in September, adding to a downturn lasting more than two years. Lagarde said: \u201cThe latest data is all heading in the same direction, downwards, and points to more sluggish growth.\u201d She refused to indicate whether there would be further rate cuts, saying the central bank would remain dependent on the data before making further cuts at its next meeting in December. The ECB\u2019s move puts it two ahead of the Bank of England, which is widely forecast to cut the cost of borrowing in the UK by 0.25 percentage points from the current level of 5% when its monetary policy committee meets next month. In the US, the Federal Reserve has indicated it is also minded to trim rates in the coming months after instituting its first reduction last month \u2013 a half-point cut. Gold reached a record high just before Thursday\u2019s ECB announcement, hitting $2,688.82 (\u00a32,065.26) an ounce for the first time, lifted by forecasts of interest rate cuts around the world and uncertainty ahead of next month\u2019s US election. Announcing its decision, the ECB said the reduction in interest rates was based on \u201can updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission\u201d. It added: \u201cThe incoming information on inflation shows that the disinflationary process is well on track. The inflation outlook is also affected by recent downside surprises in indicators of economic activity.\u201d The deposit rate sets the return paid to eurozone banks when they make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem, the euro\u2019s monetary authority comprising the ECB and national central banks. \u201cThe trends in the real economy and inflation support the case for lower rates,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. Joe Nellis, an economist at Cranfield University and an adviser to the financial consultancy MHA, said the ECB would be focused on promoting growth after a long period in which the cost of borrowing was kept high to combat inflation. \u201cUnlike the Bank of England, the ECB has a dual mandate, requiring it to take decisions to foster growth as well as control inflation. ECB policymakers will hope that this cut provides a boost to the German (and wider eurozone) economy, inspiring consumer spending, encouraging investment and ultimately stimulating the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the German economy likely to shrink for its second consecutive year, we can expect the ECB to cut rates by another 0.25% in December \u2013 this is a decision policymakers will feel they have to make if they are serious about catalysing growth in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy,\u201d he added.",

Liz Jarvis, the Liberal Democrat MP, tweeted: \u201cDiminishing women\u2019s ability to play leading roles in public life because they have young families is an attitude that should be in the distant past.\u201d Helena Dollimore, a Labour backbencher, posted: \u201cI thought nothing could shock me about the state of the Conservative party, but that was before I had to sit through Christopher Chope MP opining about whether mothers can lead political parties.\u201d Her Labour colleague Stella Creasy added: \u201cThis is why we urgently need paternity leave sorted. Because until people start wondering if dads get distracted by their kids as much as they do mums, we will always have dinosaurs walk amongst us \u2026 or in this case on the modernisation committee in parliament \u2026\u201d A spokesperson for Jenrick also disowned Chope\u2019s comments, saying: \u201cRob doesn\u2019t agree with this. He\u2019s raising three young daughters himself.\u201d Badenoch, who herself attracted criticism after appearing to suggest maternity pay was \u201cexcessive\u201d, is the current favourite in the Tory leadership election and will go head-to-head with Jenrick in a televised event on GB News on Thursday evening. Chope denied his comments related to Badenoch being a woman. Speaking later in the day to Times Radio, he insisted they were justified. \u201cI repeat the point which I was making before, and that is that Kemi has got a young family and so it\u2019s less likely that she\u2019s going to be able to spend as much time as is required as somebody who hasn\u2019t got the commitments of a young family,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s not suggesting she\u2019s unsuited or anything like that to be the leader of the opposition. And I just think there\u2019s a lot of mischief-making going on here. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that one of the candidates has got a younger family than the other one. And has also got a record of wanting to spend more time with her family than engage in going to far-flung constituencies.\u201d There was widespread anger over misogyny in politics this summer after it emerged that the US Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance had launched an attack on \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. In 2016, the Conservative party leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race after she appeared to suggest that being a mother gave her an advantage over her rival Theresa May, who had no children. Three years earlier, the Ukip politician Godfrey Bloom sparked controversy by saying that a room debating women in politics was \u201cfull of sluts\u201d after two of his colleagues admitted they did not clean behind their fridge.",

      "body": "<p>I felt compelled to respond to the latest Conservative punch-down: Kemi Badenoch\u2019s endorsement of dangerously false claims on the administrative load of neurodivergence (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/14/autistic-children-culture-wars-kemi-badenoch\">What kind of person would drag autistic children into the culture wars? The Kemi Badenoch kind, 14 October</a>). As a parent of two autistic boys without a formal diagnosis \u2013 the eldest already two years into the waiting list, with the youngster\u2019s referral somewhere in the ether \u2013 I\u2019m absolutely livid. To see your loved ones struggle without the support they need to keep them safe and well is hard enough, before they\u2019re dragged into Tory point-scoring against \u201cwoke\u201d society.</p> <p>On a professional level, I\u2019m even more affronted by these accusations of workplace meddling and entitlement by people with neurodevelopmental differences. I\u2019m part of a research group exploring autistic health inequalities, and I can assure readers that there is ample evidence that every factor that equates to poor health outcomes is more prevalent in the autistic community. This can and should change, with better knowledge and autism-informed approaches to health and social care.</p> <p>As a party so apparently keen to see people in employment, the Tories should be endorsing support for neurodivergent people in work, not making the workplace more hostile to the <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/what-we-do/news/new-data-on-the-autism-employment-gap\">70% of autistic people who are unemployed</a>. I suppose finding answers to these problems is not the intention of such polemical publications. We can only hope there can be deep institutional changes for better integration in the coming years that cannot be unpicked by a future&nbsp;rightwing government.<br><strong>Dr Erin Beeston</strong><br><em>Urmston, Greater Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have two sons with a diagnosis of autism. My eight-year-old is top of his class in every subject in a mainstream classroom, with no additional funding or accommodations, apart from a chair cushion that allows him to move around more than his peers. I&nbsp;have no doubt that he will achieve academically, but he may need future employers to understand that his brilliance comes with a directness and intensity that may not do him any favours in climbing the career ladder. An understanding of that will remove a disadvantage, not create an advantage, and has nothing to do&nbsp;with his personal \u201cresilience\u201d.</p> <p>My five-year-old is non-speaking and has far greater support needs. He had more than 200 words at the age of two and lost all of these in what is known as a regression. He has just started at a specialist school. He does not receive transport. How anyone can think his position as a non-speaking individual with lifelong care needs offers him any sort of \u201ceconomic advantages and protections\u201d is beyond me. I am shocked and devastated at the wilful ignorance displayed by politicians who are diverting the blame for a lack of investment and funding on to the different and the&nbsp;vulnerable. <br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong><br></p> <p>\u2022 As a 62-year-old who finally had an autism diagnosis at 58 (self-financed as it was a five-year wait on the Conservative-funded NHS), I can say it is a personal revelation. I have Asperger\u2019s. I have worked my whole adult life, had a family and a successful career. Over the years, my struggles with anxiety, depression and at times a very personal fear of my own insanity made parts of my life near intolerable.

      "bodyText": "I felt compelled to respond to the latest Conservative punch-down: Kemi Badenoch\u2019s endorsement of dangerously false claims on the administrative load of neurodivergence (What kind of person would drag autistic children into the culture wars? The Kemi Badenoch kind, 14 October). As a parent of two autistic boys without a formal diagnosis \u2013 the eldest already two years into the waiting list, with the youngster\u2019s referral somewhere in the ether \u2013 I\u2019m absolutely livid. To see your loved ones struggle without the support they need to keep them safe and well is hard enough, before they\u2019re dragged into Tory point-scoring against \u201cwoke\u201d society. On a professional level, I\u2019m even more affronted by these accusations of workplace meddling and entitlement by people with neurodevelopmental differences. I\u2019m part of a research group exploring autistic health inequalities, and I can assure readers that there is ample evidence that every factor that equates to poor health outcomes is more prevalent in the autistic community. This can and should change, with better knowledge and autism-informed approaches to health and social care. As a party so apparently keen to see people in employment, the Tories should be endorsing support for neurodivergent people in work, not making the workplace more hostile to the 70% of autistic people who are unemployed. I suppose finding answers to these problems is not the intention of such polemical publications. We can only hope there can be deep institutional changes for better integration in the coming years that cannot be unpicked by a future rightwing government. Dr Erin Beeston Urmston, Greater Manchester \u2022 I have two sons with a diagnosis of autism. My eight-year-old is top of his class in every subject in a mainstream classroom, with no additional funding or accommodations, apart from a chair cushion that allows him to move around more than his peers. I have no doubt that he will achieve academically, but he may need future employers to understand that his brilliance comes with a directness and intensity that may not do him any favours in climbing the career ladder. An understanding of that will remove a disadvantage, not create an advantage, and has nothing to do with his personal \u201cresilience\u201d. My five-year-old is non-speaking and has far greater support needs. He had more than 200 words at the age of two and lost all of these in what is known as a regression. He has just started at a specialist school. He does not receive transport. How anyone can think his position as a non-speaking individual with lifelong care needs offers him any sort of \u201ceconomic advantages and protections\u201d is beyond me. I am shocked and devastated at the wilful ignorance displayed by politicians who are diverting the blame for a lack of investment and funding on to the different and the vulnerable. Name and address supplied \u2022 As a 62-year-old who finally had an autism diagnosis at 58 (self-financed as it was a five-year wait on the Conservative-funded NHS), I can say it is a personal revelation. I have Asperger\u2019s. I have worked my whole adult life, had a family and a successful career. Over the years, my struggles with anxiety, depression and at times a very personal fear of my own insanity made parts of my life near intolerable. The diagnosis has begun to allow me to come to terms with those feelings by giving me an understanding of my \u201cdifference\u201d from mainstream society and how to navigate that. If I had known this about myself at an earlier stage in my life, it would have made a huge difference to me and to those around me. Any suggestion that an autism diagnosis is some kind of attempt to gain a free ride is utter nonsense. For me it is a joy to see that young people now have the chance to be diagnosed early and given a better chance to find their place in society.

      "bodyText": "Infosys, one of India\u2019s largest software companies, has reported an increase in its dividend, with a significant payout for the leader of the opposition, Rishi Sunak, and his wife, Akshata Murty. The IT outsourcing company has increased its interim dividend by 16.7% this year, according to its latest results, meaning Murty could receive a payout of up to \u00a37.5m on her holding, which is now worth around \u00a3703m. The businesswoman may have to pay as much as \u00a33m to the Treasury for this year\u2019s dividend alone after she said she would pay UK tax on her worldwide income in 2022. The wife of the then prime minister made the step after it was revealed she used non-domicile status, meaning she did not have to pay tax in Britain on her global income. The Sunaks were the wealthiest couple in history to live at 10 Downing Street and ranked 245th in the Sunday Times Rich list this year. Bengaluru-headquartered Infosys was co-founded by Murty\u2019s father, Narayana Murthy, who left the company\u2019s management in 2014, although she retains a stake. The company\u2019s performance in the six months to the end of September means Murty\u2019s shareholding of 0.94% resulted in a dividend of about \u00a37.5m this year, assuming she did not pay any tax on the sum in India. With the UK\u2019s top dividend tax rate of 39.35% applied this would generate a tax bill of \u00a32.9m on the payout from Infosys to Murty. India does sometimes impose taxes on resident and non-resident dividend payments on shares, known as a withholding tax. The potential payment to the UK Treasury is indicative of the kind of funds the government is hoping to glean from Britain\u2019s wealthiest residents in order to improve the state of the government\u2019s finances. The Labour party\u2019s manifesto said it would press ahead with the Conservative government\u2019s decision to scrap non-dom status, a tax break that allows applicants to avoid paying tax on their worldwide income in return for paying an annual levy of \u00a330,000. However, there is an ongoing debate about its execution, over concerns it could prove to be a net-negative for the exchequer if it encourages wealthy people to quit the UK. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is reportedly weighing how a new residency regime aimed at replacing the status will apply from April 2025. One in five UK bankers use non-dom status, according to analysis by tax experts, and concerns have been raised that replacing it with a four-year residency regime \u2013 as originally proposed by Reeves\u2019s predecessor as chancellor, Jeremy Hunt \u2013 might have a damaging effect on the financial sector. Treasury sources have suggested Reeves will not take steps on taxation on an ideological basis, instead favouring what raises the most for the exchequer.",

He has also spoken in the past about his struggles with alcohol addiction, is still required to undergo regular testing and said on Thursday that he also has counselling twice a week to help ease the pressure of riding at the highest level.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust this morning, I had counselling, and I have that twice a week, and that\u2019s been going on since October 2021,\u201d Murphy said, at a media event for Saturday\u2019s Champions Day at Ascot. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a huge help, and important to me.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I was suspended, apart from riding out [in the morning], I had a lot of free time, and it gave me a chance, maybe for the first time in my adult life, to just relax and take a deep breath.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen things have got stressful this year and I\u2019ve had a few days of not winning races, I\u2019ve been able to fall back on that time away. It adds perspective to realise that I\u2019m very lucky to be healthy and back riding at such a high level, and it\u2019s not the end of the world if I go a few days when I haven\u2019t been successful.\u201d</p> \n<p>A successful defence next year would see Murphy equal Willie Carson\u2019s record of five titles, with only Pat Eddery (11) and Kieren Fallon (six) still ahead of him over the last half-century.</p> \n<p>His commitment to next year\u2019s championship race was hardly emphatic, however, and it may be that regaining the title after his long, enforced absence will be enough, for now at least.</p> \n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really looked past this year, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t set myself another goal of trying to regain the championship next year and I genuinely feel that because the English weighing room is so full of stars, you really have to be committed to it before the flagfall, and be very certain that it is your goal.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most competitive, if not the most competitive weighing room in the world. There are so many Group One-winning jockeys and many of them are quite young, ambitious and hungry. Lester [Piggott], Pat and Kieren, it took incredible hunger and work ethic to achieve that so many times.\u201d</p> \n<p>Murphy sees Ryan, who recently recorded the biggest win of his career aboard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/06/bluestocking-wins-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-horse-racing\">Bluestocking in the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe</a>, as a likely title contender next year, and may turn his attention instead to increasing his tally of Group One wins.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are many races I haven\u2019t won,\u201d he said. \u201cHow far am I through my career? I don\u2019t really know, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be riding into my fifties, so I need to be successful while I can.

It adds perspective to realise that I\u2019m very lucky to be healthy and back riding at such a high level, and it\u2019s not the end of the world if I go a few days when I haven\u2019t been successful.\u201d A successful defence next year would see Murphy equal Willie Carson\u2019s record of five titles, with only Pat Eddery (11) and Kieren Fallon (six) still ahead of him over the last half-century. His commitment to next year\u2019s championship race was hardly emphatic, however, and it may be that regaining the title after his long, enforced absence will be enough, for now at least. \u201cI haven\u2019t really looked past this year, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t set myself another goal of trying to regain the championship next year and I genuinely feel that because the English weighing room is so full of stars, you really have to be committed to it before the flagfall, and be very certain that it is your goal. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most competitive, if not the most competitive weighing room in the world. There are so many Group One-winning jockeys and many of them are quite young, ambitious and hungry. Lester [Piggott], Pat and Kieren, it took incredible hunger and work ethic to achieve that so many times.\u201d Murphy sees Ryan, who recently recorded the biggest win of his career aboard Bluestocking in the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe, as a likely title contender next year, and may turn his attention instead to increasing his tally of Group One wins. \u201cThere are many races I haven\u2019t won,\u201d he said. \u201cHow far am I through my career? I don\u2019t really know, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be riding into my fifties, so I need to be successful while I can. There are two standouts, the Arc and the Derby, and they both are equally important to me.\u201d Relentless attention to the detail and nuances of race-riding has been a hallmark of Murphy\u2019s career from an early stage. Who else but Murphy himself, for instance, would have noticed an odd blip on his record at the mid-point of the season? \u201cMy strike-rate on the round course at Sandown was very poor the first half of the meetings there,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden, the last few times I\u2019ve been at Sandown, it just seemed to click. \u201cYou could say that\u2019s circumstance, but I also feel it comes down to confidence and trusting one\u2019s intuition. When you can do that, and it\u2019s something you can\u2019t force, you give yourself a better chance of getting a good result.\u201d",

The less quantifiable part was the unbreakable devotion of the Directioners, who kept faith with Payne when he began his solo career, and helped his 2017 debut single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSW2M-BB1NE\">Strip That Down</a>, into the Top 10 in the UK and the US. </p> <p>A Wolverhampton boy who had been set on a career in music since childhood, he found idoldom a mixed blessing.

He and the other members had a genuine rapport, forged by their sharing a situation that nobody who was not a 2010s pop idol could appreciate. </p> <p>They were strangers to each other when the music mogul Simon Cowell assembled the five solo singers into a group on the 2010 series of The X Factor, but rapidly became close friends. \u201cWe make each other laugh,\u201d Payne said. Their split \u2013 announced as a \u201chiatus\u201d, shortly after Malik quit in 2015 \u2013 was conducted with equal good humour. </p>    <p>But Payne found the encroachment into the group\u2019s private lives stressful \u2013 fans hid in bins outside hotels, and wrote fictional stories that had the members in romantic relationships with each other \u2013 and the boredom and loneliness of life on tour was unbearable. The attention made it impossible for the band to go out, and Payne drank heavily to cope with the lows.

Because he and Tomlinson had cowritten a number of One Direction tracks, they received a larger percentage of album royalties than the others, and Payne saw writing as a way of maintaining control of his career. In the end, offered a record deal, he decided it would be foolish to spurn the chance to sing, free of the hysteria that had surrounded the group.

The couple were together between 2016 and 2018, and Bear\u2019s arrival was a boon for Payne, who had wanted to be a young father (he was then 23). After they separated, Payne was involved in his son\u2019s upbringing, but said it was not unusual \u201cfor me to be in and out of his life\u201d. </p>    <p>Born in Wolverhampton, Payne was the youngest of Karen and Geoff Payne\u2019s three children. His mother was a nursery nurse, his father a fitter at the aerospace company Goodrich. He was adept at cross-country running and, while at St Peter\u2019s Collegiate school and City of Wolverhampton College, he narrowly missed out on a place in the England schools athletic team. After that, Liam planned to follow his father into the factory and had already looked into an apprenticeship when \u2013 having been praised for his singing at karaoke \u2013 he decided, aged 14, to audition for The X Factor. His version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBj9ctwZsX0\">Fly Me to the Moon</a> and floppy-haired charm got him as far as the Judges\u2019 Houses stage. He was at Simon Cowell\u2019s house in Barbados, and cried when Cowell told him to go back to school and do his GCSEs.</p> <p>Two years later, he returned with a smooth-jazz interpretation of Cry Me a River, winning a standing ovation from Cowell and a place in an ad hoc group formed of other solo male singers. Though the winner of the series was Matt Cardle and One Direction came third, it was clear they were going to connect with the public. Their buoyant debut single, What Makes You Beautiful, was an instant chart-topper \u2013 the first of 14 British Top 10s. </p> <p>There were three more No 1s among them, including Little Things, a meditative acoustic number whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGPeNN9S0Fg\">video</a> showed the group playing instruments \u2013 Payne was on guitar, and clearly knew his way around the instrument. Another Top 5 hit was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_v9MY_FMcw\">Best Song Ever</a>, which bounced to an 80s-style pop-rock beat. One of the band\u2019s credos was not to take themselves too seriously, and their videos were frequently funny; in Best Song Ever, Payne was told by the choreographer not to dance \u201cbecause you are perfect\u201d.

For Billie Eilish, it\u2019s a tricky dance and a trajectory I\u2019ve seen play out first-hand. Around early 2016 an invite to a performance by an artist a publicist was very excited about popped into my email. \u201cHi love,\u201d the message said. \u201cJust wondering, did you get a chance to check out 14-year-old Billie Eilish?\u201d With that, I ventured to a basement venue on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side and witnessed one of her earliest sets. It was an impressive display of performance and songwriting. How could this girl be 14 and this good? In many ways, what Eilish has done in the past eight years makes her a mind-boggling exception in a cutthroat here today, gone today industry, all while inviting people into her mind and home. I don\u2019t need to tell you about her smashes and ubiquity, there\u2019s no need to rehash her string of awards. You\u2019ve probably heard the wispy first lines in the form of \u201cWhen did it end \u2026\u201d from What Was I Made For?; a culturally defining song from a culturally defining movie, more times than you can count.

      "body": "<p>At One Direction\u2019s first audition together on The X Factor in 2010, Liam Payne \u2013 who died yesterday \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iNyflxqhXU\">is given the opening line</a>. Singing Natalie Imbruglia\u2019s Torn to Simon Cowell and Sinitta, Payne is only 16 yet has seemingly absorbed decades of pop stagecraft. It\u2019s a difficult opening verse to sell to the judges&nbsp;\u2013 downbeat and low-register&nbsp;\u2013 but Payne nails it. Rippling vibrato denotes his trembling heart and matinee-idol acting sells the line \u201cshe showed me what it was to cry\u201d as he glances off to one side as if slapped by the painful memory all&nbsp;over again.</p> <p>As the four other members join Payne, you can almost see Cowell\u2019s eyes whirling like a fruit machine. These lads can harmonise. They can soulfully extemporise. Each of them is handsome in the subtly different ways teen idols need to be handsome, from boyish to smouldering. They seem entirely comfortable wearing the ratty scarves of the era. Here is something British \u2013 even global&nbsp;\u2013 pop has been sorely missing: a genuinely convincing boyband.</p> <p>The 90s had seen the apotheosis of the form, including Take That and Backstreet Boys, but those bands\u2019 robust anthems and breezy dance-pop seemed to flame out in 2001 with the over-egged futurism of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWZKw_MgUPI\">\u2018NSync\u2019s Pop</a>, the first single from an album with the jaded title Celebrity. Justin Timberlake successfully launched a solo career while Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and an era of R&amp;B- and garage-leaning pop from groups such as Sugababes took over the UK charts. Take That reformed in the mid-00s, but brought their original, now grownup audience with them, rather than generating a fresh round of teenage hysteria. Westlife continued to rack up No 1s as late as 2006, but their proclivity for sitting on stools meant they felt boringly earthbound, more Radio 2 than Radio 1.</p>    <p>The TV talent show era also began. While Girls Aloud\u2019s psychobilly twang and poker faces were impressively edgy, the boyband One True Voice, formed alongside them on 2002\u2019s Popstars: The Rivals, were like pop antimatter. By the 00s, it seemed as if boybands belonged to a shinier, sillier age; their two modes of puppyish energy and earnest emotion felt uncool and unsophisticated.</p> <p>One Direction were fortunate, therefore, that they emerged as pop\u2019s natural trend cycle was waxing towards boybands. But they deserve rather more respect than such groups are generally afforded. They had a vital essence that \u2013 even though they were created on a TV show \u2013 can\u2019t be manufactured by the industry. An X factor, in fact.</p> <p>\u201cThey brought fun back,\u201d says Jordan Paramor, who was working at The X Factor\u2019s in-house magazine when she saw One Direction\u2019s names being pieced together on a planning table. \u201cYou&nbsp;wanted to be along for the ride, on the One Direction tour bus, because&nbsp;their life just seemed like it&nbsp;was one long, non-stop party.\u201d</p> <p>A boisterous ball of sculpted hair and grinning teeth, the boys were naughty from the off without ever feeling too grownup and dangerous. \u201cIt was like a group of lads who had gone on holiday to Ibiza for a couple of weeks who were having the time of their life,\u201d Paramor says. \u201cIt just so happened that they became world famous \u2013 and it lasted for years.\u201d</p>    <p>She remembers them filling their manager\u2019s hotel room with toilet roll and having to clear it up herself; lip-readers caught Harry Styles telling the X Factor victor Matt Cardle: \u201cThink of how much pussy you\u2019re going to get,\u201d live on TV during the final (One Direction came third).</p> <p>The other members had their own vibe \u2013 alpha hottie (Harry Styles), moody enigma (Zayn Malik), nice guy (Niall Horan), cheeky lad (Louis Tomlinson) \u2013 but&nbsp;Payne struggled to carve out a distinct identity for himself. With his lifestyle dictated by a strict work schedule, \u201che didn\u2019t ever discover who he really was\u201d, Paramor says.</p> <p>Although Payne was less obviously extroverted than Styles, Horan and Tomlinson, his impressive vocals meant that he was a cornerstone of the group\u2019s engagingly ragtag sound. Perhaps influenced by successive waves of successful indie bands, One Direction\u2019s songs leaned more towards rock than dance or R&amp;B, dialling up the irreverence all the more \u2013 their songs were still shiny pop, with the whoa-ohs of Coldplay a clear influence, but they were dusted with a little of Arctic Monkeys\u2019 grit, too.</p> <p>Not that their fans were doing much musicological musing. \u201cYou&nbsp;could just like a band \u2013 it wasn\u2019t that deep,\u201d says Paramor, who continued to be embedded with One Direction as their popularity grew, writing three of their books. \u201cThe world always needs more fun and to be uplifted. Their concerts were pure joy, just&nbsp;mania.\u201d</p>    <p>She speaks of \u201cglobal moments\u201d: very quickly, One Direction conquered America, scoring four No&nbsp;1 albums in the US. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt that they were all incredibly good-looking and charming. Everyone fancied one of them. There were always older women going: is it OK&nbsp;to fancy Harry Styles?\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Styles dated the older TV presenter Caroline Flack, while Payne dated and had a child with Girls Aloud\u2019s Cheryl Tweedy, who had been a judge on The X Factor when he was 16. These relationships were framed as transgressive by a tabloid press leaning hard into the digital age \u2013 no member of One Direction was far from the Daily Mail\u2019s showbiz \u201csidebar of shame\u201d \u2013 and then networked by social media.</p> <p>One Direction certainly reaped the benefits of being the first boyband of the mature internet era. Perhaps there was an extra intensity to pre-internet fandom, fuelled by the preciousness of fleeting in-person glimpses. But message boards, cute reaction gifs, erotic intra-band fan fiction and more created a constant, ambient One Direction fandom that was woven into followers\u2019 lives. The sense of ownership that ardent fans can feel was given a public and&nbsp;increasingly toxic forum: \u201cWe&nbsp;pay your bills!\u201d yelled some fans in comment sections after Malik left the group.</p> <p>As Take That and the Spice Girls had found, it\u2019s very difficult for pop quintets to weather one of their members leaving and breaking the mythic X factor. Malik left in March 2015 and the band was finished by the end of the year. \u201cIt was like a rat race to see who was going to become the solo artist, because you can\u2019t have five members of a boyband being the biggest star in the world,\u201d Paramor says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t room.\u201d Styles and Horan \u2013 the members whom Paramor says seemed most at ease with themselves as teenagers \u2013 went on to major success, while Malik fitfully tried out R&amp;B and Tomlinson tinkered with indie.</p>    <p>Payne chose the most purely pop route of any of them, but struggled to convince. \u201cHe was really talented, had a brilliant voice and all the stuff you need to be a pop star,\u201d Paramor says. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like he ever really found his place. It was quite fragmented; there was no structure around his solo career. You didn\u2019t really know what was coming next.\u201d In a rebellious attempt to disavow his past, he trashed his former bandmates on Logan Paul\u2019s podcast in 2022, later admitting he was in \u201ca&nbsp;scramble to stay relevant\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he ever felt quite good enough,\u201d Paramor says. \u201cHe&nbsp;was always aspiring for something more, to please everyone, to be good enough \u2013 and he <em>was</em> good enough&nbsp;... He had it all, he just couldn\u2019t see it himself.\u201d She adds that Payne was \u201calways a bit fragile, which was evident in his mental health battles\u201d. Payne was frank about his alcohol and substance abuse and how his celebrity life enabled it. \u201cThe best way to secure us, because of how big it got, was just to lock us in our rooms,\u201d he told the podcast The Diary of a CEO in 2021. \u201cAnd, of course, what is in the room? A&nbsp;minibar.\u201d In recent years, there have been questions asked of the allegedly toxic culture fomented on The X Factor, although Paramor says: \u201cThey were really well cared for, but it\u2019s still really hard in that environment to find out who you&nbsp;are.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/17/share-your-tributes-and-memories-of-liam-payne\">Share your tributes and memories of Liam Payne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, we are at an even lower ebb for boybands than we were in the early 00s, amid a fascinating gender shift.

But as Payne and One Direction demonstrated, the boyband can always bounce back; indeed, Cowell has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/04/simon-cowell-launches-search-for-new-boyband-by-highlighting-potential-solo-career\">doing auditions for another one</a> in recent weeks.

Rippling vibrato denotes his trembling heart and matinee-idol acting sells the line \u201cshe showed me what it was to cry\u201d as he glances off to one side as if slapped by the painful memory all over again. As the four other members join Payne, you can almost see Cowell\u2019s eyes whirling like a fruit machine. These lads can harmonise. They can soulfully extemporise. Each of them is handsome in the subtly different ways teen idols need to be handsome, from boyish to smouldering. They seem entirely comfortable wearing the ratty scarves of the era. Here is something British \u2013 even global \u2013 pop has been sorely missing: a genuinely convincing boyband. The 90s had seen the apotheosis of the form, including Take That and Backstreet Boys, but those bands\u2019 robust anthems and breezy dance-pop seemed to flame out in 2001 with the over-egged futurism of \u2018NSync\u2019s Pop, the first single from an album with the jaded title Celebrity. Justin Timberlake successfully launched a solo career while Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and an era of R&amp;B- and garage-leaning pop from groups such as Sugababes took over the UK charts. Take That reformed in the mid-00s, but brought their original, now grownup audience with them, rather than generating a fresh round of teenage hysteria. Westlife continued to rack up No 1s as late as 2006, but their proclivity for sitting on stools meant they felt boringly earthbound, more Radio 2 than Radio 1. The TV talent show era also began. While Girls Aloud\u2019s psychobilly twang and poker faces were impressively edgy, the boyband One True Voice, formed alongside them on 2002\u2019s Popstars: The Rivals, were like pop antimatter. By the 00s, it seemed as if boybands belonged to a shinier, sillier age; their two modes of puppyish energy and earnest emotion felt uncool and unsophisticated. One Direction were fortunate, therefore, that they emerged as pop\u2019s natural trend cycle was waxing towards boybands. But they deserve rather more respect than such groups are generally afforded. They had a vital essence that \u2013 even though they were created on a TV show \u2013 can\u2019t be manufactured by the industry. An X factor, in fact. \u201cThey brought fun back,\u201d says Jordan Paramor, who was working at The X Factor\u2019s in-house magazine when she saw One Direction\u2019s names being pieced together on a planning table. \u201cYou wanted to be along for the ride, on the One Direction tour bus, because their life just seemed like it was one long, non-stop party.\u201d A boisterous ball of sculpted hair and grinning teeth, the boys were naughty from the off without ever feeling too grownup and dangerous. \u201cIt was like a group of lads who had gone on holiday to Ibiza for a couple of weeks who were having the time of their life,\u201d Paramor says. \u201cIt just so happened that they became world famous \u2013 and it lasted for years.\u201d She remembers them filling their manager\u2019s hotel room with toilet roll and having to clear it up herself; lip-readers caught Harry Styles telling the X Factor victor Matt Cardle: \u201cThink of how much pussy you\u2019re going to get,\u201d live on TV during the final (One Direction came third). The other members had their own vibe \u2013 alpha hottie (Harry Styles), moody enigma (Zayn Malik), nice guy (Niall Horan), cheeky lad (Louis Tomlinson) \u2013 but Payne struggled to carve out a distinct identity for himself. With his lifestyle dictated by a strict work schedule, \u201che didn\u2019t ever discover who he really was\u201d, Paramor says. Although Payne was less obviously extroverted than Styles, Horan and Tomlinson, his impressive vocals meant that he was a cornerstone of the group\u2019s engagingly ragtag sound. Perhaps influenced by successive waves of successful indie bands, One Direction\u2019s songs leaned more towards rock than dance or R&amp;B, dialling up the irreverence all the more \u2013 their songs were still shiny pop, with the whoa-ohs of Coldplay a clear influence, but they were dusted with a little of Arctic Monkeys\u2019 grit, too. Not that their fans were doing much musicological musing. \u201cYou could just like a band \u2013 it wasn\u2019t that deep,\u201d says Paramor, who continued to be embedded with One Direction as their popularity grew, writing three of their books. \u201cThe world always needs more fun and to be uplifted. Their concerts were pure joy, just mania.\u201d She speaks of \u201cglobal moments\u201d: very quickly, One Direction conquered America, scoring four No 1 albums in the US. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt that they were all incredibly good-looking and charming. Everyone fancied one of them. There were always older women going: is it OK to fancy Harry Styles?\u201d Indeed, Styles dated the older TV presenter Caroline Flack, while Payne dated and had a child with Girls Aloud\u2019s Cheryl Tweedy, who had been a judge on The X Factor when he was 16. These relationships were framed as transgressive by a tabloid press leaning hard into the digital age \u2013 no member of One Direction was far from the Daily Mail\u2019s showbiz \u201csidebar of shame\u201d \u2013 and then networked by social media. One Direction certainly reaped the benefits of being the first boyband of the mature internet era. Perhaps there was an extra intensity to pre-internet fandom, fuelled by the preciousness of fleeting in-person glimpses. But message boards, cute reaction gifs, erotic intra-band fan fiction and more created a constant, ambient One Direction fandom that was woven into followers\u2019 lives. The sense of ownership that ardent fans can feel was given a public and increasingly toxic forum: \u201cWe pay your bills!\u201d yelled some fans in comment sections after Malik left the group. As Take That and the Spice Girls had found, it\u2019s very difficult for pop quintets to weather one of their members leaving and breaking the mythic X factor. Malik left in March 2015 and the band was finished by the end of the year. \u201cIt was like a rat race to see who was going to become the solo artist, because you can\u2019t have five members of a boyband being the biggest star in the world,\u201d Paramor says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t room.\u201d Styles and Horan \u2013 the members whom Paramor says seemed most at ease with themselves as teenagers \u2013 went on to major success, while Malik fitfully tried out R&amp;B and Tomlinson tinkered with indie. Payne chose the most purely pop route of any of them, but struggled to convince. \u201cHe was really talented, had a brilliant voice and all the stuff you need to be a pop star,\u201d Paramor says. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like he ever really found his place. It was quite fragmented; there was no structure around his solo career. You didn\u2019t really know what was coming next.\u201d In a rebellious attempt to disavow his past, he trashed his former bandmates on Logan Paul\u2019s podcast in 2022, later admitting he was in \u201ca scramble to stay relevant\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think he ever felt quite good enough,\u201d Paramor says. \u201cHe was always aspiring for something more, to please everyone, to be good enough \u2013 and he was good enough ... He had it all, he just couldn\u2019t see it himself.\u201d She adds that Payne was \u201calways a bit fragile, which was evident in his mental health battles\u201d. Payne was frank about his alcohol and substance abuse and how his celebrity life enabled it. \u201cThe best way to secure us, because of how big it got, was just to lock us in our rooms,\u201d he told the podcast The Diary of a CEO in 2021. \u201cAnd, of course, what is in the room? A minibar.\u201d In recent years, there have been questions asked of the allegedly toxic culture fomented on The X Factor, although Paramor says: \u201cThey were really well cared for, but it\u2019s still really hard in that environment to find out who you are.\u201d Today, we are at an even lower ebb for boybands than we were in the early 00s, amid a fascinating gender shift. Female pop stars were once presented as glamorous \u2013 and sexualised \u2013 aspirational figures. Such stars still exist today, albeit with palpably greater agency in their image\u2011making \u2013take Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 but they are greatly outnumbered by artists such as Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan and Charli xcx, plus the indie-leaning Mitski and Phoebe Bridgers: singers who are intensely relatable, write their own material and have become celebrated in a euphoric sorority. The screams that were once directed at boybands are now directed, at the same pitch and intensity, towards women who feel like them. There are other forces at play that are keeping boybands out of the picture. As Dorian Lynskey has argued, the vertical frame of TikTok and Instagram favours solo artists over groups. But as Payne and One Direction demonstrated, the boyband can always bounce back; indeed, Cowell has been doing auditions for another one in recent weeks. He would do well to find even one member as instantly convincing as Payne, singing about heartbreak with the authority of a man twice his age.",

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up. The head of the European Central Bank has declared that the process of \u2018breaking the neck of inflation\u2019 is underway. Christine Lagarde said that the process of crushing inflation was not yet complete, even though the eurozone CPI fell to just 1.7% in September. She told reporters: \u201cHave we broken the neck of inflation. Not yet. Are we in the process of breaking that neck? Yes.\u201d Lagarde was speaking after the European Central Bank cut its headline interest rate by a quarter of a point to 3.25%. The cut is the ECB\u2019s first back-to-back interest rate cut in 13 years and its third of 2024. That puts it two ahead of the Bank of England, which is widely forecast to cut the cost of borrowing in the UK by 0.25 percentage points from the current level of 5% when its monetary policy committee meets again next month. And in other news\u2026 Meanwhile over in the US, retail sales rose more rapidly than expected last month, new data shwows. U.S. retail sales rose 0.4% last month after an unrevised 0.1% gain in August, ahead of forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies in New York, says: \u201cAt the margin, it confirms the U.S. economy remains relatively resilient still.\u201d ECB president Christine Lagarde also warned that Europe\u2019s economy could suffer if Donald Trump becomes the next US president and imposes fresh tariffs on European goods entering the US. She told reporters today that trade is an important element of the European economy. So any restrictions, uncertainty or obstacles to trade would matters for the European economy, as it is very open and trades with other countries around the world. She says: Any hardening of the barriers, the tariffs, the additional obstacles on the possibility to trade with the rest of the world is obviously a downside. During his first term, Trump hit Europe\u2019s steel and aluminum exports with tariffs, and he often spoke critically of Europe\u2019s trade surplus with the US. According to Bloomberg this week, the EU has prepared a list of American goods it could target with tariffs if former President Donald Trump wins the US election and follows through on his threat to hit the bloc with punitive trade measures. Under questioning by journalists in Solvenia, ECB president Christine Lagarde says the central bank is in the process of \u2018breaking the neck\u2019 of inflation. In a surprise turn of phrase, she declares: \u201cHave we broken the neck of inflation. Not yet. Are we in the process of breaking that neck? Yes.\u201d Lagarde reveals that she popped to the market in Ljubljana (where the governing council held this month\u2019s meeting) earlier this week, to check prices. She points out that food, alcohol &amp; tobacco prices across the eurozone rose 2.4% over the last year \u2013 that\u2019s too high for the ECB\u2019s comfort. She adds: Are we breaking the neck of it? Yes, I think so. It\u2019s not broken completely yet, but we\u2019re getting there. The ECB chief also admits that inflation is not yet sustainably at its 2% target, even though it fell below the target to just 1.7% last month. The time at which we reach that 2% sustainably has advanced a bit, it is not yet now. We will have to wait further.\u201d Christine Lagarde says the European Central Bank is looking at the economic risks posed by the conflict in the Middle East. She tells reporters that the ECB is concerned about the \u201cmajor\u201d and \u201chorrifying\u201d conflict, beyond the humanitarian implications, saying: We are looking at the economic consequences. And we are looking in particular at the impact that this conflict could have on trade, because that part of the world is very much open to trade and the passage of ships\u2026 We are also very attentive to the price of oil \u2013 that can be impacted. The European Central Bank remains hopeful that it can pull off a \u2018soft landing\u2019 \u2013 cooling inflation without triggering a recession. Christine Lagarde insists today that \u201cthe disinflationary process is well on track\u201d, which allowed the central bank to cut rates today. She told reporters: \u201cAre we still on a soft landing expectations? The answer is, on the basis of the information that we have, we certainly do not see a recession. So the euro area, on the basis of what we have, is not heading for recession. And we are still looking at that soft landing.\u201d Christine Lagarde points out that eurozone inflation fell in September to 1.7%, the lowest since April 2021, thanks to a 6.1% drop in energy costs. Eurozone government should design their fiscal and structural policies to make their economies more productive, competitive and resilient, Christine Lagarde says. It is \u2018crucial\u2019 to follow up on the proposals made this year by Mario Draghi (on competition) and Enrico Letta (on reforming the single market), she adds. The ECB expect the eurozone economy to strengthen over time, as rising real incomes lift household consumption, Lagarde says. Lagarde says that the eurozone labour market remains resilient, with unemployment still low. But employment growth is slowing, surveys suggest. Turning to the economic picture, Lagarde says the incoming information suggests that economic activity has been \u201csomewhat weaker than expected\u201d. Manufacturing has continued to contract, she warns, while the services sector ticked up in August, but has been more sluggish since. Business are only expanding their investment slowly, while housing investment continued to fall. Exports have weakened, especially for goods, she adds. Over at the Bank of Slovenia, in Ljubljana, the European Central Bank is holding a press conference to explain why it has lowered eurozone interest rates today. ECB president Christine Lagarde begins by running through the statement issued half an hour ago (it\u2019s online here). She\u2019s explaining that the ECB\u2019s governing council decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, because data shows that the disinflationary process is well on track. As flagged earlier, Lagarde says that inflation is expected to rise in the coming months, before declining to target in the course of next year. And she insists that the Governing Council is \u201cdetermined\u201d to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. She says: It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path. [They\u2019re in Slovenia as part of the ECB\u2019s policy of occasionally holding meetings away from Frankfurt] German Conservative MEP Markus Ferber, who is the EPP Coordinator in the European Parliament\u2019s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECON), has welcomed today\u2019s rate cut. Ferber says: \u201cThe decision to lower interest rates is the right decision at the right time. Inflation data has come in good, growth is sluggish and other central banks have also started to lower rates. In light of recent developments, another rate cut was the only sensible choice. The ECB would be well advised to stay the course. The key challenge in monetary policy is getting the timing right as monetary policy only works with a considerable time-lag. The ECB cannot only respond to data, it also has to anticipate developments. If you only \u2018drive by sight\u2019 you might miss the right moment to correct course. The ECB has been overly cautious in the past and it is good news that Lagarde does not make the same mistake twice. The sluggish European economy needs a liquidity boost, but monetary policy is not the silver bullet. We will only get back on a path of growth, if EU governments do something about productivity growth and reforms.\u201d The euro slipped to a new 10-week low after the ECB announced it had cut interest rates again. The single currency dropped to $1.0832, the lowest since 2nd August, before recovering slightly to $1.0842. Dean Turner, chief eurozone economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts the ECB will squeeze in another rate cut before the end of this year, saying: \u201cThe ECB cut rates for the third time in this cycle today, in a move that was widely expected following a string of softer economic data. In our view, this is unlikely to be the last cut from the ECB this year. Another cut is likely in December, and we expect this will be followed by a series of cuts at every meeting through to June next year, with the deposit rate hitting 2% before the ECB reaches for the pause button. Financial experts had generally expected the European Central Bank to cut interest rates today, so there\u2019s no shock at the decision. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, says the ECB was \u201ccompelled into action today\u201d as the economic outlook \u201cturns for the worse\u201d. Selfin explains: The limited data flow ahead of the decision meant the ECB placed more weight on a raft of survey evidence which signalled a deteriorating economic backdrop. Domestic activity shows no sign of improvement as households remain cautious despite robust growth in household incomes. Meanwhile geopolitical tensions are clouding the outlook for Eurozone exports. \u201cToday\u2019s decision reflects a growing number of Governing Council members feeling more confident about inflation returning sustainably to target in the medium term. Moreover, the ECB will likely have been attentive to the fact that the weakening growth outlook could be a contributing factor to inflation undershooting in the medium term, and will likely want to avoid a repeat of the pre-pandemic era. Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, points out that this the first time in 13 years that the ECB has announced a back-to-back interest rate cut (it also lowered rates in September). James adds: With inflation now sitting well below the ECB\u2019s target and economic growth still sluggish, markets had been expecting the Bank would continue on its path of rate cuts\u2026. \u201cLooking ahead, the ECB will be keeping an extremely close eye on the data that comes out before its December meeting. It will be pleased that inflation has finally come in lower than target, but keeping the economy afloat will be its next challenge.\u201d Jim Gott, head of asset surveillance at Mount Street, agrees that today\u2019s decision was expected, given \u201cthe stagnating European economy and falling inflation\u201d: Germany, the continent\u2019s economic powerhouse, is clearly struggling, while the likes of Spain and Italy have been more resilient. This shift is evident in the uptick in Commercial Real Estate deals in southern Europe, which is a complete reversal from 2012. There remains a major economic imbalance in the Eurozone \u2013 German GDP growth is lagging behind other major European economies, whilst its debt balance is also lower \u2013 which continues to pose a challenge for the ECB. Whilst the whole Eurozone will benefit from today\u2019s rate cut, the impact on the German economy is likely to be minimal.\u201d It\u2019s notable that the ECB talks about \u201crecent downside surprises in indicators of economic activity\u201d (see earlier post). That\u2019s an acknowledgement that the economic outlook has deteriorated; Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, appears to be falling into recession, while the eurozone only grew by 0.2% in the April-June quarter. The European Central Bank also predicts that inflation will pick up in the coming months, before dropping back to its 2% target next year. It says: Inflation is expected to rise in the coming months, before declining to target in the course of next year. Domestic inflation remains high, as wages are still rising at an elevated pace. At the same time, labour cost pressures are set to continue easing gradually, with profits partially buffering their impact on inflation. The ECB says it has cut interest rates because \u201cincoming data show we are well on track to reach our inflation goal.\u201d The ECB has also lowered its other key interest rates (it has three), by a quarter of one percentage point. As well as cutting the deposit rate to 3.25%, it has also lowered its main refinancing operations rate to 3.4%, and the marginal lending facility rate to 3.65%. The main refinancing operation rate is the cost for banks of borrowing funds from the ECB on a weekly basis. The marginal lending facility rate is the cost of overnight credit to banks. Newsflash: Eurozone interest rates have been cut for the third time this year. The European Central Bank has lowered its benchmark deposit rate to 3.25%, from 3.5%, today. The ECB\u2019s governing council voted to lower borrowing costs again, after inflation fell below its 2% target last month to just 1.7% (see earlier post). Announcing the decision, the ECB says: The decision to lower the deposit facility rate \u2013 the rate through which the Governing Council steers the monetary policy stance \u2013 is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The incoming information on inflation shows that the disinflationary process is well on track. The inflation outlook is also affected by recent downside surprises in indicators of economic activity. Meanwhile, financing conditions remain restrictive. The deposit rate sets the return paid to eurozone banks when they make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem. Just 10 minutes until we hear the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate decision. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says: It\u2019s ECB day and everyone expects another cut and the first back-to-back of the cycle. The ECB only publish forecasts each quarter, so they\u2019ll need to justify a cut at this meeting without a forecast by acknowledging growth and inflation weakness since the September meeting forecasts and hint towards downgrades in December. Indeed, only this morning we found out that the September CPI reading for the Euro Area was revised down a tenth to +1.7%, so the momentum is in that direction. But in terms of forward guidance, our economists think they\u2019re unlikely to move away from their meeting-by-meeting data dependent approach. So you probably won\u2019t learn too much about their subsequent plans, even with an acknowledgement of the recent data weakness. The UK stock market has hit a one-month high this morning, with the FTSE 100 index currently up 28 points or 0.35% at 8357 points. Pest control firm Rentokil are the top riser, up 9%, after telling the City that the integration of its US residential pest control arm, Terminix, \u201ccontinues to go well\u201d. Rentokil says that its action plans to increase North America organic growth have strengthened since it issued a profit warning last month. That should cheer activist investor Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Partners took a seat on the board last month. All isn\u2019t totally rosy in the US, though. Rentokil has reported that inflation has pushed up material and consumable costs in the North America, while a \u201cweaker termite season\u201d has left it with more stocks in its inventory. The gold price has climbed to a new alltime high this morning. Bullion hit $2,688.82 per ounce for the first time, lifted by forecasts of interest rate cuts and uncertainty ahead of next month\u2019s US election: Kelvin Wong, OANDA senior market analyst for Asia Pacific. \u201cInvestors are seeking safe-haven gold as a hedge amid uncertainty over the U.S. election. A Trump presidency should support gold as it might raise trade tensions and widen the budget deficit.\u201d Gold has gained around 30% this year, as investors have flocked to the classic safe-haven asset. As gold doesn\u2019t actually offer a yield, it can be favoured by lower interest rates. It is also seen as a hedge against inflation, so its recent rally may suggest fears that inflation will be more persistent than hoped. Shares in mining giant Anglo American have jumped over 3% this morning, amid talk that rival BHP could make a new bid for the company soon. The Financial Times has reported that BHP chief executive Mike Henry met government officials in South Africa last week, fuelling speculation that the Australian miner will resurrect its failed \u00a339bn bid for Johannesburg-based rival Anglo American. Henry and chief development officer Catherine Raw reportedly met South Africa government officials and the Public Investment Corporation, the state-owned asset manager. Back in late May, BHP walked away from Anglo after failing to win the board\u2019s support for its proposal. That triggered a City rule that means it can\u2019t bid again for six months, a period that ends on 29 November. Back in the City, Deliveroo has reported a rise in orders over the latest quarter, amid \u201chealthy\u201d growth in the UK and Ireland. Order numbers rose by 2% to 71.1 million, while the gross transaction value (GTV) of its orders grew by 5% to \u00a31.78bn for the three months to September. The takeaway delivery specialist told shareholders it has made progress in \u201ca more stable but still uncertain consumer environment\u201d. It said adjusted earnings for the full year are now on track to be in the \u201cupper half\u201d of its \u00a3110m to \u00a3130m range. Wonk news: Paul Johnson, the Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is stepping down next summer after a 14-year stint leading the influential thinktank. He\u2019s off to run Queen\u2019s College, Oxford. Johnson, whose rapid analysis of UK budgets has been invaluable over the years, says: \u201cThis really is a bittersweet moment. I first started at the IFS as a brand new graduate back in 1988, leaving in 1998 and returning as director in 2011. The IFS has been an incredibly important part of my life. I love it, what it does and what stands for, and all my amazing colleagues. But after 14 years at the helm, it feels like the right time to move on and start a new chapter in my life.\u201d Johnson\u2019s immediate predecessor, Robert Chote, was recently appointed as President of Trinity College Oxford, while his predecessor Andrew Dilnot has led two colleges \u2013 St Hugh\u2019s and Nuffield. French spirits maker Pernod Ricard has been hit by weakness in China. Pernod Ricard, whose brands include Martell cognac, Mumm champagne and Absolut vodka, has reported an 8.5% drop in sales in the last quarter. Sales in China fell by 26%, which the company blamed on \u201ca challenging macroeconomic environment with weak consumer demand over the summer and into the Mid-Autumn Festival\u201d. Newsflash: Inflation across the eurozone fell by more than initially thought last month, which may cement the chances of interest rate cuts today. Consumer prices across the euro area rose by 1.7% in the year to September, statistics body Eurostat reports, down from 2.2% in August. That matches inflation in the UK last month, and confirms that eurozone inflation was below the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target. Eurostat reports that energy prices fell by 6.1% year-on-year, while services prices rose by 3.9%, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco by 2.4% and goods by 0.4%. Eurozone inflation had initially been estimated at 1.8% in September, in Eurostat\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 reading at the start of this month. Eurostat reports: The lowest annual rates were registered in Ireland (0.0%), Lithuania (0.4%), Slovenia and Italy (both 0.7%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Romania (4.8%), Belgium (4.3%) and Poland (4.2%). Compared with August 2024, annual inflation fell in twenty Member States, remained stable in two and rose in five. Westminster insiders are playing down this morning\u2019s reports that it will reverse Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to only run the HS2 rail line from London to Birmingham. Asked about reports it will revive HS2 to Crewe (see 8.45am), a government source said: \u201cWe have always said we won\u2019t be taking plans for HS2 phase 2 back off the shelf after the Conservatives took a wrecking ball to the project and allowed costs to spiral completely out of control. \u201cBut we are committed to delivering better rail connectivity across the north, as set out in our manifesto. \u201cTransport is an essential part of the Government\u2019s mission to rebuild Britain and grow our economy.\u201d Consumer goods maker Nestl\u00e9 has reported that demand has weakened, after its sale fell during the first nine months of this year. Nestl\u00e9 has cut its outlook for sales this year, and now expects organic sales to rise by 2%, down from at least 3% expected before. Total sales in 2024 have dropped to 67.1bn Swiss francs, down from 68.8bn in the first three quarters of 2023. The company has hiked its prices of its products \u2013 which include bottled water, coffee, pet food and ice cream \u2013 by 1.6% this year, a slowdown following \u201cunprecedented increases in the prior two years\u201d, it reports. Laurent Freixe, Nestl\u00e9 CEO, says: \u201cWe delivered organic sales growth, driven by positive real internal growth. Consumer demand has weakened in recent months, and we expect the demand environment to remain soft. Given this outlook and our further actions to reduce customer inventories in the fourth quarter, we have updated our full-year guidance, with organic sales growth expected to be around 2%, in line with the first nine months. Freixe, who took control last month, has also announced plans to streamline Nestl\u00e9\u2019s management structure, merging its Latin America and North America units, and putting Greater China into its Asia, Oceania and Africa businesses. Christine Lagarde may be questioned about the proposed merger between Italy\u2019s UniCredit and Germany\u2019s Commerzbank at today\u2019s press conference. Last month, Lagarde said that such cross-border mergers were desirable, after Unicredit lifted its stake in Commerzbank. Lagarde argued that it would show that efforts to integrate Europe\u2019s financial markets such as the banking union, were paying off. Berlin doesn\u2019t agree, though \u2013 there\u2019s been a political backlash to the idea, with chancellor Olaf Scholz calling the Italian move \u201can unfriendly attack\u201d. German officials fear that they could end up footing the bill if UniCredit were to be dragged into an Italian debt crisis, for example. But as Simon Nixon argues here, the deal makes sense, though there is unease over the way Unicredit amassed its stake, including buying some Commerzbank shares sold by the German government. Wealth manager St James\u2019s Place has warned that this month\u2019s budget is \u201ccompounding\u201d unpredictability in the investment market. In its latest results this morning, St James\u2019s Place says: The macroeconomic environment has improved since the beginning of the year, but there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for consumers, savers and investors. The company, which is overhauling its fee structure under pressure from regulators, also reported net inflows of \u00a3890m in the third quarter of the year. The future of the HS2 rail line could soon be decided. LBC are reporting that the government will soon announce that HS2 will run from London Euston to Crewe. According to the LBC report, state-owned HS2 LTD will not oversee the extension to Crewe, and the multi-billion-pound project will be handed to a private sector consortium instead. LBC say: According to sources close to the project, Ministers have re-evaluated the cost-benefit of HS2 and concluded the line should continue beyond Birmingham - reversing a decision made by the then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at his party\u2019s conference last year. A year ago, Sunak scrapped the northern leg of HS2, meaning it would start in Birmingham, rather than Manchester. Under that plan, the line would terminate outside central London at Old Oak Common \u2013 unless private investment would pay for it to reach Euston. Last week, cabinet minister Lisa Nandy hinted that a cut-price \u201cHS2-lite\u201d would run from Birmingham to Crewe Rail industry analysis has shown that runing the line from Crewe to Euston would make financial sense. The euro has dipped to its lowest level in two and a half months, as investors anticipate a cut from the European Central Bank today. The single currency has dropped to $1.0847 this morning, the lowest since 2nd August. It\u2019s been weakening through October, having hit $1.12 at the end of September. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, suggests the euro has further to fall if the ECB sounds dovish today. The ECB has little choice but to cut. Germany\u2019s economy is continuing to show signs of struggle. German investor confidence was weaker than expected this week, and a number of Eurozone economies have extremely low levels of inflation. As we lead up this meeting, EUR/USD has made a fresh 2-month low and is back trading around $1.0850. There is a lot of expectation already priced into the market, however, momentum is to the downside for the euro, and a dovish tilt from the ECB could exacerbate the euro even more. There\u2019s a flurry of takeover drama in the City this morning. N Brown Group, the online fashion retailer, has agreed to be taken over in a \u00a3191m deal, led by its fourth largest shareholder, Joshua Alliance. The recommended cash acquisition is worth 40p per share, nearly a 50% premium to N Brown\u2019s closing share price last night. This morning, shares have jumped to 38.5p. Joshua Alliance owns 6.6% of the company\u2019s shares, while almost half is owned by his father, Lord David Alliance of Manchester, who formerly chaired the company [and also played a key role in the rescue of 20,000 Ethiopian Jews from Sudan]. Overall, the Alliance Family Concert Party own 53.4% of its shares, and are backing the deal. Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group owns 20% \u2013 one of Ashley\u2019s many interests in UK retailers. Shares in Expedia, the nearly $20bn US travel booking website, are set to rally today following reports that transport and delivery firm Uber has explored a possible bid. Uber, the Financial Times reports, has approached advisers in recent months to examine whether such a deal would be possible and how it could be structured. It would be Uber\u2019s bigger acquisition yet, and give it access to new growth opportunities. However, the situation is still at an early stage, as a formal approach hasn\u2019t yet been made to Expedia and the two sides aren\u2019t in discussions. A deal would help Uber transform itself into a \u2018super app\u2019, offering users a wide range of services through a single application as Chinese tech groups such as WeChat already do well. Intriguingly, Uber\u2019s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was previously the chief executive of Expedia. Expedia\u2019s shares have jumped by 7.2% in after-hours trading on Wall Street, while Uber\u2019s shares have dropped by 2.9%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The welcome slowdown in global inflation is clearing the way for central banks to pull down interest rates, and today the spotlight falls on the European Central Bank. The ECB is expected to make its third rate cut of the year today, putting it two cuts ahead of the Bank of England. Policymakers are under pressure to cut after eurozone inflation was estimated to fall below the ECB\u2019s 2% target in September (we get the final reading today too). Economists predict the ECB will cut its deposit rate by another quarter-point today, to 3.25%, as its governing council meets in Ljubljana, Slovenia, today. President Christine Lagarde is also expected to leave the door wide open for another cut in December. With European countries such as Germany struggling this year, lower interest rates would be welcomed by business and consumers across the eurozone. Last week, Greece\u2019s central bank governor Yannis Stournaras piled pressure on the governing council, dclaring that \u201chighly restrictive\u201d interest rates could be lowered faster than previously anticipated. Neil Hutchison, European liquidity strategies portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says it would be a surprise if the ECB don\u2019t cut today: \u201cWith Halloween on the horizon, we\u2019re not expecting any scary surprises from the ECB this week. Spooked by weaker PMI business survey data, the ECB is likely to deliver a 0.25% rate cut. Recent cooling in inflation data means they\u2019re less burdened by potential price pressures. With minimal pushback from ECB members, markets would be surprised if a cut didn\u2019t happen. Beyond this meeting, the outlook is currently enveloped in a Halloween haze, with concerns over a potential growth slowdown and geopolitical tensions, amid resilient wage growth and low unemployment.\u201d The agenda 10am BST: Eurozone inflation estimate for September (final reading) 1.15pm BST: European Central Bank sets interest rates 1.30pm BST: US retail sales for September 1.30pm: US weekly jobless claims 1.45pm BST: European Central Bank press conference Tonight: Annual City Banquet at Mansion House",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Ipswich Pts 4 GD -8</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why have they struggled?</strong></p> <p>Ipswich are not carrying themselves like strugglers. They were dealt the toughest of starts after 22 years out of the top flight, facing Liverpool and Manchester City, so an element of catchup was inevitable. But a few jitters may set in if they do not emerge from their next three games, all winnable, with a first victory. Kieran McKenna reinforced his squad heavily in the summer and, while the core that won promotion remain, there has been an inevitable settling in process. Liam Delap has hit the ground running after moving from City but their fate may hang on how quickly his fellow recruits find their rhythm.</p> <p><strong>What signs of hope are there?</strong> Until an error-strewn defeat at West Ham last time out, Ipswich could take positives from every game. They defended stoutly to hold off Brighton and then, when Aston Villa visited a typically atmospheric Portman Road, showed a more familiar side in a 2-2 draw they should have won. They do not look out of place and, with a few better decisions in attacking areas, would be significantly better off. Kalvin Phillips has started well after his surprise loan move and Delap, Jacob Greaves and Omari Hutchinson are three of the best young English players around; all three should only improve as the season continues.</p> <p><strong>How safe is the manager? </strong>McKenna\u2019s job is among the safest in the Premier League. Ipswich breathed a huge sigh of relief when he signed a lucrative new deal in May despite overtures from several top-flight rivals. He has barely put a foot wrong since arriving in December 2021 and will be forgiven a few bumps in the road this season. He has shown that, when required, his team can display a more pragmatic approach than the swashbuckling style that took them up the divisions. <strong>NA</strong></p>    <h2><strong>Crystal Palace Pts 3 GD -5</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why have they struggled?</strong> The turnover in players in the summer, with four arriving on deadline day after the departures of Michael Olise, Jordan Ayew and Joachim Andersen, has been a major factor. A new defence has struggled for consistency and Oliver Glasner\u2019s side have looked a long way off the attacking outfit that finished last season so well and have scored only five times in their opening seven matches. The goals have dried up for Jean-Philippe Mateta with Adam Wharton and Eberechi Eze failing to recapture the form that earned them selection for England\u2019s Euro 2024 squad.</p> <p><strong>What signs of hope are there?</strong> Palace spent about \u00a365m on signings in the summer \u2013 not including the free transfer Daichi Kamada from Lazio \u2013 and brought in Trevoh Chalobah on loan from Chelsea. None of them have really made their mark so far but there are promising signs that Maxence Lacroix, Chalobah and Marc Gu\u00e9hi can develop into an imposing back three given time to gel. Isma\u00efla Sarr, Kamada and Eddie Nketiah have shown flashes of their ability but must produce goals to move Palace up the table.</p> <p><strong>How safe is the manager? </strong>Glasner could do no wrong at the end of last season but will have matched Palace\u2019s infamous start to the 2016-17 season \u2013 when they had three points from eight matches after sacking Frank de Boer \u2013 should they lose to Nottingham Forest on Monday. Given his reliance on wing-backs, the Austrian must find a solution to replace Daniel Mu\u00f1oz on the right if the Colombian remains out after limping off against Liverpool in their last game. Glasner will realise another defeat would pile on the pressure before meetings with Tottenham and Aston Villa. <strong>EA</strong></p>    <h2><strong>Southampton Pts 1 GD \u2013 11</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why have they struggled? </strong>The fourth-best team in the Championship last season were always going to find the step up in class tough. They have tried to bolster the squad; seven of the starting XI in last month\u2019s damning defeat by Bournemouth did not start for the club in the league last season. Cameron Archer, one of 14 summer signings, scored his first goal against Arsenal last time out and Aaron Ramsdale is an upgrade in goal. Russell Martin has been criticised for being dogmatic but, as he said after that 3-1 loss at Bournemouth, the goals they conceded were not due to style but rather a lack of aggression. Southampton have a bloated squad and the manager is evidently unsure of his best team.</p> <p><strong>What signs of hope are there?</strong> The 18-year-old Tyler Dibling, who joined the academy aged eight, has been the overwhelming beacon of light. The Exeter-born teenager was superb on his full debut against Manchester United, almost opening the scoring after picking the ball up inside his own half and later winning a penalty. Dibling, who is at his best taking the ball on the half-turn and burning clear of defenders, showed superb poise to bury his first senior goal against Ipswich. Martin has placed huge trust in a player he says the world is surely watching.</p> <p><strong>How safe is the manager? </strong>Martin was rewarded with a new three-year contract after leading Saints to promotion via a Wembley playoff final.

      "bodyText": "Ipswich Pts 4 GD -8 Why have they struggled? Ipswich are not carrying themselves like strugglers. They were dealt the toughest of starts after 22 years out of the top flight, facing Liverpool and Manchester City, so an element of catchup was inevitable. But a few jitters may set in if they do not emerge from their next three games, all winnable, with a first victory. Kieran McKenna reinforced his squad heavily in the summer and, while the core that won promotion remain, there has been an inevitable settling in process. Liam Delap has hit the ground running after moving from City but their fate may hang on how quickly his fellow recruits find their rhythm. What signs of hope are there? Until an error-strewn defeat at West Ham last time out, Ipswich could take positives from every game. They defended stoutly to hold off Brighton and then, when Aston Villa visited a typically atmospheric Portman Road, showed a more familiar side in a 2-2 draw they should have won. They do not look out of place and, with a few better decisions in attacking areas, would be significantly better off. Kalvin Phillips has started well after his surprise loan move and Delap, Jacob Greaves and Omari Hutchinson are three of the best young English players around; all three should only improve as the season continues. How safe is the manager? McKenna\u2019s job is among the safest in the Premier League. Ipswich breathed a huge sigh of relief when he signed a lucrative new deal in May despite overtures from several top-flight rivals. He has barely put a foot wrong since arriving in December 2021 and will be forgiven a few bumps in the road this season. He has shown that, when required, his team can display a more pragmatic approach than the swashbuckling style that took them up the divisions. NA Crystal Palace Pts 3 GD -5 Why have they struggled? The turnover in players in the summer, with four arriving on deadline day after the departures of Michael Olise, Jordan Ayew and Joachim Andersen, has been a major factor. A new defence has struggled for consistency and Oliver Glasner\u2019s side have looked a long way off the attacking outfit that finished last season so well and have scored only five times in their opening seven matches. The goals have dried up for Jean-Philippe Mateta with Adam Wharton and Eberechi Eze failing to recapture the form that earned them selection for England\u2019s Euro 2024 squad. What signs of hope are there? Palace spent about \u00a365m on signings in the summer \u2013 not including the free transfer Daichi Kamada from Lazio \u2013 and brought in Trevoh Chalobah on loan from Chelsea. None of them have really made their mark so far but there are promising signs that Maxence Lacroix, Chalobah and Marc Gu\u00e9hi can develop into an imposing back three given time to gel. Isma\u00efla Sarr, Kamada and Eddie Nketiah have shown flashes of their ability but must produce goals to move Palace up the table. How safe is the manager? Glasner could do no wrong at the end of last season but will have matched Palace\u2019s infamous start to the 2016-17 season \u2013 when they had three points from eight matches after sacking Frank de Boer \u2013 should they lose to Nottingham Forest on Monday. Given his reliance on wing-backs, the Austrian must find a solution to replace Daniel Mu\u00f1oz on the right if the Colombian remains out after limping off against Liverpool in their last game. Glasner will realise another defeat would pile on the pressure before meetings with Tottenham and Aston Villa. EA Southampton Pts 1 GD \u2013 11 Why have they struggled? The fourth-best team in the Championship last season were always going to find the step up in class tough. They have tried to bolster the squad; seven of the starting XI in last month\u2019s damning defeat by Bournemouth did not start for the club in the league last season. Cameron Archer, one of 14 summer signings, scored his first goal against Arsenal last time out and Aaron Ramsdale is an upgrade in goal. Russell Martin has been criticised for being dogmatic but, as he said after that 3-1 loss at Bournemouth, the goals they conceded were not due to style but rather a lack of aggression. Southampton have a bloated squad and the manager is evidently unsure of his best team. What signs of hope are there? The 18-year-old Tyler Dibling, who joined the academy aged eight, has been the overwhelming beacon of light. The Exeter-born teenager was superb on his full debut against Manchester United, almost opening the scoring after picking the ball up inside his own half and later winning a penalty. Dibling, who is at his best taking the ball on the half-turn and burning clear of defenders, showed superb poise to bury his first senior goal against Ipswich. Martin has placed huge trust in a player he says the world is surely watching. How safe is the manager? Martin was rewarded with a new three-year contract after leading Saints to promotion via a Wembley playoff final. Giving Arsenal a fright last time out eased immediate pressure but Martin knows results must follow to satisfy the owner, Dragan Solak, who sanctioned more than \u00a3100m on signings, and that encouraging data or statistics count for little. \u201cNo one cares unless you win,\u201d he said this week.

The UK government believes the novichok was brought into Britain by agents tasked by Vladimir Putin to target the former spy Sergei Skripal, who had been settled in Salisbury after a spy exchange, the inquiry heard earlier this week. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned on 4 March 2018 and both survived.

Rachel Reeves, the chancellor of the exchequer, is finalising her first autumn budget, set for 30 October, and experts fear that though the money for GB Energy will remain intact, she will place such tight restrictions on the company as to effectively cut off its lifeblood.</p> <h2>What\u2019s the plan for Great British Energy?</h2> <p>Great British Energy is one of the most recognisable and popular of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/21/is-labour-on-track-to-meet-its-promises-on-the-environment\">policies that brought Labour to power in July\u2019s general election</a>. A national energy champion, in contrast to the foreign-owned companies that dominate the UK\u2019s energy scene; a company owned by the people of Britain that will invest in a new generation of renewable energy supply; a plan that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/24/labour-uk-clean-energy-superpower-fuel-poverty\">cut the UK\u2019s carbon footprint while reducing household bills</a>.</p> <p>The company will be led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/31/business-leader-urges-labour-to-stand-by-28bn-pledge-for-green-economy\">J\u00fcrgen Maier, former UK chief executive of the engineering company Siemens</a>, and a longstanding champion of clean technology. With \u00a38.3bn in initial funding, GBE is one of the government\u2019s few remaining green spending pledges, after Labour\u2019s initial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/31/what-is-labour-green-plan-and-could-it-be-shelved-explainer\">plans for a \u00a328bn a year public investment in a \u201cgreen industrial strategy</a>\u201d were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/08/labour-cuts-28bn-green-investment-pledge-by-half\">gutted</a> in February.</p> <p>Offshore wind, including revolutionary floating turbines, tidal power, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and other emerging technologies will be the focus of the company\u2019s investments. Maier wants GBE to stand alongside globally significant players such as Denmark\u2019s national clean energy company, \u00d8rsted, and Sweden\u2019s Vattenfall.</p> <p>But when Reeves stands up in parliament on 30 October, she is unlikely to give Maier the boost that many experts say is needed. The Guardian understands that the Treasury is determined to keep GBE within tight fiscal controls. That means it will not have the powers to borrow new money to invest, lest any debt that it accumulates could be counted towards the government\u2019s massive debt pile, and upset delicate calculations on Reeves\u2019s fiscal rules.</p> <p>Failing to give GBE the freedom to borrow would be a crucial mistake, according to Mathew Lawrence, the founder and director of the Common Wealth thinktank, credited with coming up with the original idea for a national energy company. \u201cReeves should exempt GBE from public sector net borrowing rules,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can do that.\u201d</p> <p>Maier is more circumspect. He appears to still hold out hope of a change of mind from the Treasury at some point,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/16/gb-energy-can-become-a-major-power-generator-says-its-chief-executive\"> telling the Guardian</a>: \u201cWhether in the future we can borrow or not, I think is a discussion for later on.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves also seems to prefer GBE to take minority stakes in large renewable energy projects. That too is a problem, according to Lawrence. \u201cGBE should take majority stakes, in order to have control over these projects,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to Lawrence, the key benefits that GBE can deliver to boost the UK\u2019s green energy sector are: cost, coherence and certainty. On cost, GBE can lower costs by using the government\u2019s might to invest capital more efficiently and at lower interest rates than private companies can access.</p> <p>Coherence means that the government can take an overview of the UK\u2019s energy needs and invest strategically to meet them, unlike private companies, which can only take a piecemeal view. Certainty reflects the fact that the government is driven not by short-term profit like the private sector, but by a long-term goal of decarbonising power, which gives a clear future direction that all its investments and policies must work towards.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/10/green-energy-firms-promise-more-than-24bn-of-private-investment-in-britian\">Industry is ready to work with the government</a>, the Guardian has found, but businesses want to see more clarity from ministers over the plans. One senior industry source told the Guardian that \u201cincreasingly there is a meeting of minds\u201d between investors and government officials over the role for the new entity.</p> <p>That marks a change in attitude, as GBE was initially a cause for concern among businesses. Senior executives within Europe\u2019s largest energy companies feared that a state-backed enterprise would lay claim to preferential treatment in the government\u2019s clean energy schemes \u2013 and potentially edge out private capital. Miliband has been quick to reassure the industry that GB Energy would seek to \u201ccrowd in\u201d new investment rather than crowd it out.</p> <p>Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, the industry\u2019s trade body, who is shortly to take up a new role as chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, the statutory adviser to ministers on climate policy, said the public energy company had \u201cgreat potential to advance the UK\u2019s clean energy ambitions\u201d if it tried to \u201csupport and complement \u2013 rather than duplicate \u2013 the investment, expertise and experience of the private sector\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cKickstarting the development of newer technologies and supporting community projects while larger and established sources like wind and solar continue to grow, would also fulfil an existing need,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Which areas will it invest in?</h2> <p>GB Energy\u2019s first step has been in the direction of Britain\u2019s world-leading offshore wind sector. It has included a partnership with the crown estate, which aims to accelerate the build-out of enough giant offshore windfarms across the estate\u2019s seabed off the coastlines of England and Wales to power 20m homes.</p> <p>Through this partnership GB Energy will undertake early development work on sites before the seabed licences are granted to windfarm developers to help speed up the process. In exchange it will claim a small stake in the windfarm. This is expected to accelerate the \u00a360bn of private sector investment in the government\u2019s green energy goals \u2013 and deliver healthy returns for GB Energy.</p> <p>Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, which recently doubled its spending plans for the UK for the next four years to \u00a324bn, said: \u201cMore than ever, the government is heading in the right direction. If targeted properly, GB Energy will directly support [the 2030 clean energy target] by producing a plan we can all get behind and deliver.\u201d</p> <p>There remains uncertainty over which areas the government will target beyond offshore wind. Anderson believes that emerging technologies \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/what-is-carbon-capture-usage-and-storage\">controversial</a> with many environmentalists \u2013 such as green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage are ripe for \u201ctailored support\u201d from the government, which could include investment from GB Energy. \u201cFunding for Britain\u2019s ports will also speed up the development of offshore wind and create growth for coastal communities,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Greg Jackson, the chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, pointed to long-duration energy storage as another example of currently underfunded emerging technologies where GB Energy could \u201cunlock private capital through co-investment\u201d.</p> <p>Ahead of the budget, investors are less concerned about the amount of public sector funding available than about gaining clarity around the government\u2019s plans, and the policies and regulations which will underpin them. </p> <p>\u201cWhether investment comes from the government or from the private sector \u2013 the key thing is policy,\u201d said Jackson.</p> <p>GBE is also critical for Scotland, for the 200,000 jobs in North Sea oil and gas, which Labour is anxious to reassure voters will still be stable for decades to come. Aberdeen was chosen as headquarters for political reasons: to help offset the complaints from North Sea oil and gas companies about the Treasury\u2019s decision to increase windfall taxes, partly to fund GB Energy, and Miliband\u2019s determination to block new oil exploration licences \u2013 complaints the Scottish Conservatives and Scottish National party have amplified.</p> <p>The UK government also faces a further stiff test next summer, when 400 oil industry jobs will be lost with the closure of Scotland\u2019s only oil refinery at Grangemouth, with over 2,000 more in the supply chain threatened.</p> <p>That is intensifying pressure on the Treasury to properly fund projects on the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/01/north-sea-oil-transition-plan\">just transition</a>, where unemployed oil workers are helped to find new jobs in the green economy, including new college courses or a government-funded \u201cskills passport\u201d where oil workers can transfer their oil industry skills to renewables.</p> <p>Senior Labour sources in Scotland said they wanted to see progress on cutting household electricity bills and new rules to ensure communities that host these new green energy projects, including the new pylons and subsea cables needed, get a share of the profits.</p> <p>Michael Shanks, a Scottish MP who became a junior energy minister in July, told UK Labour conference in Liverpool last month that \u201cquite significantly\u201d improving these community benefit schemes was a priority \u2013 including giving them a direct stake in GB Energy projects.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to look at how communities can be in the driving seat of some of that. So instead of developers deciding what that looks like, it should be compulsory, but also a community has some stake in designing it. And that goes for network infrastructure as well, not just the generation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A senior Labour figure said there were early indications the Treasury would authorise spending on enlarging Scotland\u2019s coastal ports, which are ill-prepared for the huge wind turbines and installation vessels needed for the vast new offshore windfarms being planned.</p> <p>The Scottish Trades Union Congress has told Labour ministers GB Energy needs to focus a significant proportion of its investment in Scotland, because a disproportionate number of North Sea jobs are there.</p> <p>Roz Foyer, the STUC\u2019s general secretary, said 84,000 Scottish workers depended on oil and gas jobs, while the numbers employed in renewables, estimated at 6,000 people, had barely risen in Scotland over the past decade despite the heavy investment in windfarms. \u201cThe investment in GB Energy has to go disproportionately to Scotland because of the disproportionate amount of oil and gas jobs that are going to be lost,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Decarbonising UK electricity by 2030 will be a stretching target \u2013 even if new renewables are built swiftly and grid connection problems resolved, a small amount of gas-fired power is still likely to be needed. But experts told the Guardian that even if the target was missed, the effort should put the UK on track to meet net zero and help dispense with volatile fossil fuels. Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance, said: \u201cLots of questions remain, but the government has hit the ground running in setting up GB Energy to speed the transition to clean power, and that should be strongly welcomed.\u201d</p>",

Great British Energy is at the heart of the recently elected Labour government\u2019s pitch to decarbonise the UK\u2019s power sector by 2030. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, told an audience in Aberdeen on Thursday that the company would \u201charness the potential we have to truly lead the world in renewables jobs\u201d. With \u00a38.3bn in new government investment, GB Energy is one of the few new spending commitments Labour is planning, amid consternation among ministers over swingeing cuts elsewhere. But the crucial decisions that will determine whether GB Energy can be a success, or not, will be taken far from Aberdeen, in London\u2019s No 11 Downing Street. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor of the exchequer, is finalising her first autumn budget, set for 30 October, and experts fear that though the money for GB Energy will remain intact, she will place such tight restrictions on the company as to effectively cut off its lifeblood. What\u2019s the plan for Great British Energy? Great British Energy is one of the most recognisable and popular of the policies that brought Labour to power in July\u2019s general election. A national energy champion, in contrast to the foreign-owned companies that dominate the UK\u2019s energy scene; a company owned by the people of Britain that will invest in a new generation of renewable energy supply; a plan that will cut the UK\u2019s carbon footprint while reducing household bills. The company will be led by J\u00fcrgen Maier, former UK chief executive of the engineering company Siemens, and a longstanding champion of clean technology. With \u00a38.3bn in initial funding, GBE is one of the government\u2019s few remaining green spending pledges, after Labour\u2019s initial plans for a \u00a328bn a year public investment in a \u201cgreen industrial strategy\u201d were gutted in February. Offshore wind, including revolutionary floating turbines, tidal power, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and other emerging technologies will be the focus of the company\u2019s investments. Maier wants GBE to stand alongside globally significant players such as Denmark\u2019s national clean energy company, \u00d8rsted, and Sweden\u2019s Vattenfall. But when Reeves stands up in parliament on 30 October, she is unlikely to give Maier the boost that many experts say is needed. The Guardian understands that the Treasury is determined to keep GBE within tight fiscal controls. That means it will not have the powers to borrow new money to invest, lest any debt that it accumulates could be counted towards the government\u2019s massive debt pile, and upset delicate calculations on Reeves\u2019s fiscal rules. Failing to give GBE the freedom to borrow would be a crucial mistake, according to Mathew Lawrence, the founder and director of the Common Wealth thinktank, credited with coming up with the original idea for a national energy company. \u201cReeves should exempt GBE from public sector net borrowing rules,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can do that.\u201d Maier is more circumspect. He appears to still hold out hope of a change of mind from the Treasury at some point, telling the Guardian: \u201cWhether in the future we can borrow or not, I think is a discussion for later on.\u201d Reeves also seems to prefer GBE to take minority stakes in large renewable energy projects. That too is a problem, according to Lawrence. \u201cGBE should take majority stakes, in order to have control over these projects,\u201d he said. According to Lawrence, the key benefits that GBE can deliver to boost the UK\u2019s green energy sector are: cost, coherence and certainty. On cost, GBE can lower costs by using the government\u2019s might to invest capital more efficiently and at lower interest rates than private companies can access. Coherence means that the government can take an overview of the UK\u2019s energy needs and invest strategically to meet them, unlike private companies, which can only take a piecemeal view. Certainty reflects the fact that the government is driven not by short-term profit like the private sector, but by a long-term goal of decarbonising power, which gives a clear future direction that all its investments and policies must work towards. Industry is ready to work with the government, the Guardian has found, but businesses want to see more clarity from ministers over the plans. One senior industry source told the Guardian that \u201cincreasingly there is a meeting of minds\u201d between investors and government officials over the role for the new entity. That marks a change in attitude, as GBE was initially a cause for concern among businesses. Senior executives within Europe\u2019s largest energy companies feared that a state-backed enterprise would lay claim to preferential treatment in the government\u2019s clean energy schemes \u2013 and potentially edge out private capital. Miliband has been quick to reassure the industry that GB Energy would seek to \u201ccrowd in\u201d new investment rather than crowd it out. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, the industry\u2019s trade body, who is shortly to take up a new role as chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, the statutory adviser to ministers on climate policy, said the public energy company had \u201cgreat potential to advance the UK\u2019s clean energy ambitions\u201d if it tried to \u201csupport and complement \u2013 rather than duplicate \u2013 the investment, expertise and experience of the private sector\u201d. \u201cKickstarting the development of newer technologies and supporting community projects while larger and established sources like wind and solar continue to grow, would also fulfil an existing need,\u201d she said. Which areas will it invest in? GB Energy\u2019s first step has been in the direction of Britain\u2019s world-leading offshore wind sector. It has included a partnership with the crown estate, which aims to accelerate the build-out of enough giant offshore windfarms across the estate\u2019s seabed off the coastlines of England and Wales to power 20m homes. Through this partnership GB Energy will undertake early development work on sites before the seabed licences are granted to windfarm developers to help speed up the process. In exchange it will claim a small stake in the windfarm. This is expected to accelerate the \u00a360bn of private sector investment in the government\u2019s green energy goals \u2013 and deliver healthy returns for GB Energy. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, which recently doubled its spending plans for the UK for the next four years to \u00a324bn, said: \u201cMore than ever, the government is heading in the right direction. If targeted properly, GB Energy will directly support [the 2030 clean energy target] by producing a plan we can all get behind and deliver.\u201d There remains uncertainty over which areas the government will target beyond offshore wind. Anderson believes that emerging technologies \u2013 controversial with many environmentalists \u2013 such as green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage are ripe for \u201ctailored support\u201d from the government, which could include investment from GB Energy. \u201cFunding for Britain\u2019s ports will also speed up the development of offshore wind and create growth for coastal communities,\u201d he said. Greg Jackson, the chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, pointed to long-duration energy storage as another example of currently underfunded emerging technologies where GB Energy could \u201cunlock private capital through co-investment\u201d. Ahead of the budget, investors are less concerned about the amount of public sector funding available than about gaining clarity around the government\u2019s plans, and the policies and regulations which will underpin them. \u201cWhether investment comes from the government or from the private sector \u2013 the key thing is policy,\u201d said Jackson. GBE is also critical for Scotland, for the 200,000 jobs in North Sea oil and gas, which Labour is anxious to reassure voters will still be stable for decades to come. Aberdeen was chosen as headquarters for political reasons: to help offset the complaints from North Sea oil and gas companies about the Treasury\u2019s decision to increase windfall taxes, partly to fund GB Energy, and Miliband\u2019s determination to block new oil exploration licences \u2013 complaints the Scottish Conservatives and Scottish National party have amplified. The UK government also faces a further stiff test next summer, when 400 oil industry jobs will be lost with the closure of Scotland\u2019s only oil refinery at Grangemouth, with over 2,000 more in the supply chain threatened. That is intensifying pressure on the Treasury to properly fund projects on the so-called just transition, where unemployed oil workers are helped to find new jobs in the green economy, including new college courses or a government-funded \u201cskills passport\u201d where oil workers can transfer their oil industry skills to renewables. Senior Labour sources in Scotland said they wanted to see progress on cutting household electricity bills and new rules to ensure communities that host these new green energy projects, including the new pylons and subsea cables needed, get a share of the profits. Michael Shanks, a Scottish MP who became a junior energy minister in July, told UK Labour conference in Liverpool last month that \u201cquite significantly\u201d improving these community benefit schemes was a priority \u2013 including giving them a direct stake in GB Energy projects. \u201cWe want to look at how communities can be in the driving seat of some of that. So instead of developers deciding what that looks like, it should be compulsory, but also a community has some stake in designing it. And that goes for network infrastructure as well, not just the generation,\u201d he said. A senior Labour figure said there were early indications the Treasury would authorise spending on enlarging Scotland\u2019s coastal ports, which are ill-prepared for the huge wind turbines and installation vessels needed for the vast new offshore windfarms being planned. The Scottish Trades Union Congress has told Labour ministers GB Energy needs to focus a significant proportion of its investment in Scotland, because a disproportionate number of North Sea jobs are there. Roz Foyer, the STUC\u2019s general secretary, said 84,000 Scottish workers depended on oil and gas jobs, while the numbers employed in renewables, estimated at 6,000 people, had barely risen in Scotland over the past decade despite the heavy investment in windfarms. \u201cThe investment in GB Energy has to go disproportionately to Scotland because of the disproportionate amount of oil and gas jobs that are going to be lost,\u201d she said. Decarbonising UK electricity by 2030 will be a stretching target \u2013 even if new renewables are built swiftly and grid connection problems resolved, a small amount of gas-fired power is still likely to be needed. But experts told the Guardian that even if the target was missed, the effort should put the UK on track to meet net zero and help dispense with volatile fossil fuels. Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance, said: \u201cLots of questions remain, but the government has hit the ground running in setting up GB Energy to speed the transition to clean power, and that should be strongly welcomed.\u201d",

The title refers to Trump\u2019s adventures as a young man under the informal mentorship of the notorious New York lawyer Roy Cohn \u2013 former chief counsel for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/11/mccarthyism-us-second-world-war\">Joseph McCarthy</a>, among other things \u2013 and from whom, the movie suggests, Trump picked up much of his conniving and ruthlessness. Trump is so lurid in life that he may be impossible to fictionalise, but the movie has a good crack. That it fails leaves one feeling vaguely cheated of an opportunity to deepen one\u2019s loathing for Trump with a little more background and insight.</p> <p>With the US election two and half weeks away, any representation of Trump, if it\u2019s not up to scratch, risks looking like either an act of hubris or total obliviousness. The Apprentice, which languished in development for years before getting a boost when the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/05/apprentice-trump-movie-ali-abbasi\">Jeremy Strong agreed to play Cohn</a>, is at best a tabloid romp in which Trump-as-playboy is compellingly rendered and at worst a piece of counterintuitivism so obvious it\u2019s more predictable than a straightforward hatchet job. Sebastian Stan, as the young Trump, injects just the right level of nascent tics into his performance \u2013 the pursed lips, the flapping hands, the constant faffing with the hair \u2013 so that he appears physically very convincing. At the front end of the movie, the film-makers also make Trump appear gauchely, winningly, absurdly sympathetic.</p> <p>We see Trump, a teetotaller, throwing up in the street after Cohn forces him to drink neat spirits while discussing a business deal. We see him dithering, shocked and naive, in the face of Cohn\u2019s blackmailing of city officials. We see him trying to deal with his alcoholic brother, Freddy, with a few stabs at largesse. Later, we see porny shots of Trump getting a blowjob, and, in a scene that seems to have dropped in from a different movie entirely, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/donald-trump-biopic-the-apprentice-ali-abbasi-cannes\">a shot of him raping his first wife</a>, Ivana, on the floor of the Trump Tower penthouse \u2013 a fictionalised account of an incident that was mentioned in the couple\u2019s divorce proceedings, but which Ivana later walked back on.

      "bodyText": "The singular piece of publicity most helpful to The Apprentice, a film about Donald Trump that opened in the US last week and opens in the UK this Friday, is the fact its subject tried to block the movie\u2019s release. The title refers to Trump\u2019s adventures as a young man under the informal mentorship of the notorious New York lawyer Roy Cohn \u2013 former chief counsel for Joseph McCarthy, among other things \u2013 and from whom, the movie suggests, Trump picked up much of his conniving and ruthlessness. Trump is so lurid in life that he may be impossible to fictionalise, but the movie has a good crack. That it fails leaves one feeling vaguely cheated of an opportunity to deepen one\u2019s loathing for Trump with a little more background and insight. With the US election two and half weeks away, any representation of Trump, if it\u2019s not up to scratch, risks looking like either an act of hubris or total obliviousness. The Apprentice, which languished in development for years before getting a boost when the actor Jeremy Strong agreed to play Cohn, is at best a tabloid romp in which Trump-as-playboy is compellingly rendered and at worst a piece of counterintuitivism so obvious it\u2019s more predictable than a straightforward hatchet job. Sebastian Stan, as the young Trump, injects just the right level of nascent tics into his performance \u2013 the pursed lips, the flapping hands, the constant faffing with the hair \u2013 so that he appears physically very convincing. At the front end of the movie, the film-makers also make Trump appear gauchely, winningly, absurdly sympathetic. We see Trump, a teetotaller, throwing up in the street after Cohn forces him to drink neat spirits while discussing a business deal. We see him dithering, shocked and naive, in the face of Cohn\u2019s blackmailing of city officials. We see him trying to deal with his alcoholic brother, Freddy, with a few stabs at largesse. Later, we see porny shots of Trump getting a blowjob, and, in a scene that seems to have dropped in from a different movie entirely, a shot of him raping his first wife, Ivana, on the floor of the Trump Tower penthouse \u2013 a fictionalised account of an incident that was mentioned in the couple\u2019s divorce proceedings, but which Ivana later walked back on. We see him becoming meaner and grander as eventually he eclipses and humiliates Cohn, putting the audience in the odd position of feeling sorry for that horrible old shark. What we don\u2019t see, in director Ali Abbasi\u2019s movie, is a coherent explanation for any of it, nor a reckoning with Trump\u2019s personality that takes into account what must be considered a much greater influence in its development than Cohn \u2013 namely his father, Fred Sr. For this, you need to look in the direction of the only Trump-related product worth your time at the moment, which is the book Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father\u2019s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success, by Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig, two reporters on the New York Times investigations team.

      "bodyText": "Paul Collingwood insisted England had not given up hope of beating Pakistan despite ending the third day of the second Test on a near-exhausted pitch on 36 for two, still 261 runs from a distant and testing target. \u201cWe\u2019ll still have belief,\u201d the assistant coach said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a hell of a chase, but we\u2019ve got to be realistic \u2013 it\u2019s a tough ask.\u201d England\u2019s pursuit started dismally, with Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley both falling within the first four overs. Their only real cause for optimism is the ease \u2013 at least once he had benefited from two dropped catches while still in single figures \u2013 with which Salman Agha scored 63 late-innings runs as Pakistan reached 221 in their second knock. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be realistic, it\u2019s going to be a tough chase on what is effectively the ninth day that this wicket\u2019s been played on,\u201d Collingwood said. \u201cBut this team\u2019s capable of some special things, and it\u2019s got some batters who can put bowlers under pressure in these kinds of conditions. We all know if you get on a roll, and get a partnership going, anything can happen.\u201d Collingwood said that victory in this match would be a greater achievement even than last week\u2019s record-smashing success in the opening Test, which was played on the same Multan pitch. \u201cI think it would, under the circumstances and the conditions we\u2019ve been given,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amazing thing now is there\u2019s still hope, and there\u2019s only hope because of the amazing things these guys have done in the past.\u201d But England will not rein in their attacking instincts in a match situation that might send some players into their shells. \u201cThe stats will tell you when you are chasing on day four, if you prod around and don\u2019t try to put the bowler under pressure you will get caught by the close fielders,\u201d Collingwood said. \u201cWe will not go away from our mantra. Our mantra is to soak up pressure when we need to but apply as much pressure as we possibly can when you get the opportunity.\u201d It was Salman\u2019s 65-run ninth-wicket partnership with the irrepressible Sajid Khan that stretched England\u2019s chances of taking a 2-0 lead in the series from the feasible to the far-fetched, with Pakistan\u2019s selection gamble for this game \u2013 dropping several of their most well-known players and stuffing their side with spinners \u2013 apparently set to pay off. \u201cI was thinking it would be hard because there was a lot of big changes,\u201d Salman said. \u201cThe way the new guys have come in, it is very good for Pakistan cricket. It will be massive [to win] because we haven\u2019t won a Test match at home for I don\u2019t know how many years now. It will be a big thing for us and we will put all our efforts there.\u201d",

Autumnal light rears up at acute angles, a dazzling reminder that it\u2019s always too early to put away your sunglasses. </p> \n<p>It\u2019s this time of year when sports fans\u2019 thoughts turn naturally to one of the great annual showpiece tournaments. </p> \n<p>We\u2019re talking, of course, about the World Conker Championships, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/14/cheating-alleged-after-mens-world-conker-champion-found-with-steel-chestnut\">generated more media interest</a> in the past week than England\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team\">men\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-women-cricket-team\">women\u2019s cricket teams</a> combined. Normally it\u2019s small children who obsess over the shiny brown treasures foraged from the footpath. But recent events have proved that adults, too, go bonkers over conkers.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/14/cheating-alleged-after-mens-world-conker-champion-found-with-steel-chestnut\">Cheating alleged after men\u2019s world conker champion found with steel chestnut</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If you\u2019ve managed to miss the story \u2013 how, exactly? \u2013 the headline is that the newly crowned men\u2019s world champion, David Jakins, 82, has been accused of cheating. The runner-up was suspicious when his own conker shattered on impact during their bout. Asked to turn out his pockets, Jakins was found in possession of a steel conker painted to look like a real one.</p> \n<p>The champion, aka \u201cKing Conker\u201d, maintains his innocence and insists&nbsp;he&nbsp;uses it only for pranking kids, The ring judge insisted that Jakins, like all contestants, picked his nut&nbsp;blind from a bag full of tournament issue. Doctored conkers just aren\u2019t possible. But the organisers now say&nbsp;they have extended their investigation, \u201cfollowing new evidence coming to light\u201d.</p> \n<p>Is it, possibly, the evidence that cheating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2024/oct/15/world-conker-championships-rocked-by-steel-chestnut-cheating-claims-video\">makes for great publicity</a>? After all, certain sports only command national attention when there\u2019s a possibility that someone broke the rules. Not many people can name the top three chess players in the world, but Hans Niemann, currently ranked 18th, has been famous ever since the Norwegian world champion Magnus Carlsen lost to him in 2022 and immediately refused to play him again. The subsequent furore lent chess a sexy sheen of scandal for months.</p> \n<p>Niemann was found innocent of every allegation against him, and has since settled the dispute with Carlsen, after admitting to cheating in \u201crandom\u201d online games as a teenager. But it\u2019s not often that a 20-year-old is forced to sit down for an interview with Piers Morgan and answer the question: \u201cHave you ever used anal beads while playing chess?\u201d then have to deny using a sex toy to receive secret messages during games.</p> \n<p>You can say-it-ain\u2019t-so-Joe all you like, but most sports fans love the drama of a cheating scandal. And we seem to particularly appreciate them in the fringe sports that would otherwise pass us by. Somehow they manage to tickle both sides of our brain simultaneously \u2013 both the sophisticated, self-aware part that recognises the utter absurdity of the competitive pastimes we have invented, and the ancestral part that wants to evict wrongdoers from our community and leave them to be eaten by bears.</p> \n<p>Trivial pursuits can have serious consequences. Two anglers were sentenced to 10 days in jail after they were found guilty in 2023 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/30/cheating-allegations-fishing-tournament-ohio-weights-fillets-lake-erie-anglers\">cheating at an Ohio tournament</a>, having stuffed their catch with lead weights and fish fillets in pursuit of the $30,000 prize. The video taken in the immediate aftermath, when organisers gutted their haul and revealed their wrongdoing, suggests they were lucky to get away from their furious fellow competitors unharmed.</p> \n<p>Perhaps we\u2019re drawn to these episodes because, for just a moment, we imagine we\u2019re taking a collective moral stance. So much cheating in modern sport goes unpunished, from financial shenanigans to institutionalised doping. Some of it is positively normalised: witness the routine sight of footballers falling to the ground grasping at their faces like extras from a second world war movie.</p> \n<p>Theoretically, sport only makes sense as a concept if people play it on level terms, and within the framework of arbitrary rules it sets for itself. In reality, a millionaire entrepreneur is trying to launch a version of the Olympics where competitors can juice themselves to the eyeballs, and England\u2019s most successful, and coincidentally richest, football club is under investigation on multiple charges of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-manchester-citys-hearing-and-charges\">breaking its own league\u2019s financial rules</a> (it denies the allegations). The modern line is that what benefits the individual \u2013 even the richest and most powerful of them \u2013 benefits all of us. What\u2019s good for the industry is good for sport.</p> \n<p>So perhaps, when the World Conker Championships is subject to&nbsp;cheating rumours, we find ourselves feeling nostalgic for imagined simpler times, those good&nbsp;old Wacky Races days when&nbsp;cheating was as simple as jumping in a car halfway through running a marathon, or scoring a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/08/world-cup-moments-maradona-hand-god\">World Cup goal with your fist</a>. Back then, it was easier to tell who the wrong \u2019uns were.</p> \n<p>And who could blame the conker world if it helps to generate a bit of publicity for their event and its fundraising causes?

      "bodyText": "Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, close bosom-friend of the Boden gilet. Leaves shed from trees in a blaze of colour, and make their way straight for train tracks. Autumnal light rears up at acute angles, a dazzling reminder that it\u2019s always too early to put away your sunglasses. It\u2019s this time of year when sports fans\u2019 thoughts turn naturally to one of the great annual showpiece tournaments. We\u2019re talking, of course, about the World Conker Championships, which has generated more media interest in the past week than England\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s cricket teams combined. Normally it\u2019s small children who obsess over the shiny brown treasures foraged from the footpath. But recent events have proved that adults, too, go bonkers over conkers. If you\u2019ve managed to miss the story \u2013 how, exactly? \u2013 the headline is that the newly crowned men\u2019s world champion, David Jakins, 82, has been accused of cheating. The runner-up was suspicious when his own conker shattered on impact during their bout. Asked to turn out his pockets, Jakins was found in possession of a steel conker painted to look like a real one. The champion, aka \u201cKing Conker\u201d, maintains his innocence and insists he uses it only for pranking kids, The ring judge insisted that Jakins, like all contestants, picked his nut blind from a bag full of tournament issue. Doctored conkers just aren\u2019t possible. But the organisers now say they have extended their investigation, \u201cfollowing new evidence coming to light\u201d. Is it, possibly, the evidence that cheating makes for great publicity? After all, certain sports only command national attention when there\u2019s a possibility that someone broke the rules. Not many people can name the top three chess players in the world, but Hans Niemann, currently ranked 18th, has been famous ever since the Norwegian world champion Magnus Carlsen lost to him in 2022 and immediately refused to play him again. The subsequent furore lent chess a sexy sheen of scandal for months. Niemann was found innocent of every allegation against him, and has since settled the dispute with Carlsen, after admitting to cheating in \u201crandom\u201d online games as a teenager. But it\u2019s not often that a 20-year-old is forced to sit down for an interview with Piers Morgan and answer the question: \u201cHave you ever used anal beads while playing chess?\u201d then have to deny using a sex toy to receive secret messages during games. You can say-it-ain\u2019t-so-Joe all you like, but most sports fans love the drama of a cheating scandal. And we seem to particularly appreciate them in the fringe sports that would otherwise pass us by. Somehow they manage to tickle both sides of our brain simultaneously \u2013 both the sophisticated, self-aware part that recognises the utter absurdity of the competitive pastimes we have invented, and the ancestral part that wants to evict wrongdoers from our community and leave them to be eaten by bears. Trivial pursuits can have serious consequences. Two anglers were sentenced to 10 days in jail after they were found guilty in 2023 of cheating at an Ohio tournament, having stuffed their catch with lead weights and fish fillets in pursuit of the $30,000 prize. The video taken in the immediate aftermath, when organisers gutted their haul and revealed their wrongdoing, suggests they were lucky to get away from their furious fellow competitors unharmed. Perhaps we\u2019re drawn to these episodes because, for just a moment, we imagine we\u2019re taking a collective moral stance. So much cheating in modern sport goes unpunished, from financial shenanigans to institutionalised doping. Some of it is positively normalised: witness the routine sight of footballers falling to the ground grasping at their faces like extras from a second world war movie. Theoretically, sport only makes sense as a concept if people play it on level terms, and within the framework of arbitrary rules it sets for itself. In reality, a millionaire entrepreneur is trying to launch a version of the Olympics where competitors can juice themselves to the eyeballs, and England\u2019s most successful, and coincidentally richest, football club is under investigation on multiple charges of breaking its own league\u2019s financial rules (it denies the allegations). The modern line is that what benefits the individual \u2013 even the richest and most powerful of them \u2013 benefits all of us. What\u2019s good for the industry is good for sport. So perhaps, when the World Conker Championships is subject to cheating rumours, we find ourselves feeling nostalgic for imagined simpler times, those good old Wacky Races days when cheating was as simple as jumping in a car halfway through running a marathon, or scoring a World Cup goal with your fist. Back then, it was easier to tell who the wrong \u2019uns were. And who could blame the conker world if it helps to generate a bit of publicity for their event and its fundraising causes? I don\u2019t want to say they have form, but two years ago, when Jakins prepared the conkers for the women\u2019s final, his daughter won the title and a similar \u201cinvestigation\u201d was launched. A spokesperson duly assured concerned fans that no one had anal beads (or, presumably, fish fillets) inserted into their body. What raises the profile of one conkers event raises the profile of them all. Some, like the Waveney Valley Conkers Tournament and the Peckham Conker Championships, have made it clear that they welcome sharp practice, be it baking your nuts, soaking them in vinegar, or even injecting them with resin. You could say it\u2019s all about growing the game. I say it\u2019s just not conkers.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>HIGHS AND LOWS</strong></h2> <p>While last week\u2019s win by 10-man Bolivia over Colombia in an Air Miles World Cup qualifier might have raised a few eyebrows, it shouldn\u2019t really have come as much of surprise. Not content with the controversial advantage playing home games at high altitude in La Paz used to give them, the Bolivians have recently and quite literally cranked things up several notches. Moving another 560m uphill, they played their last two home games more than four kilometres above sea level at the Estadio Municipal de El Alto, where the air is so thin visiting teams might as well be trying to play in outer space. Sadly for <em>La Verde</em>, they also have to descend the Andes to play away from home and in this week\u2019s qualifier against the World Cup holders, they came seriously unstuck.</p> <p>Having spent most of his career being compared with Cristiano Ronaldo, it may have come to Lionel Messi\u2019s attention that his preening Portuguese nemesis marked the end of his participation in the current international break <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/15/scotland-portugal-nations-league-match-report\">by throwing a comically petulant strop</a> at the end of his side\u2019s scoreless draw with Scotland, yet another game in which he was bizarrely indulged by his manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez, despite his increasingly negligible contributions to the cause. By stark contrast, Messi chipped in with just the three goals and two assists as Argentina put Bolivia to the sword courtesy of a 6-0 win at the Estadio Monumental, in a game that was actually played 12 metres <em>below</em> sea level, a state of affairs that won\u2019t have suited their visitors at all.</p> <p>In scoring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/16/messi-scores-his-10th-argentina-hat-trick-but-says-last-games-are-approaching\">his 10th hat-trick for Argentina</a>, Messi made it 112 international goals, which means the only person at that level to have scored more than him is that fella last spotted getting his radge on at Portugal being denied the opportunity to take a last-gasp corner at Hampden Park. With Argentina sitting pretty at the top of the South American World Cup standings, Messi was obviously asked if he\u2019d be hanging around to help them to defend their title in 2026. \u201cI didn\u2019t set any date or deadline about my future,\u201d he parped. \u201cI\u2019m just enjoying all this. I am more emotional than ever and taking all the love from the people because I know these can be my last games.\u201d</p> <p>Following his bravura performance against the mountain goats of Bolivia, the MLS Cup playoffs are next on the agenda for football\u2019s actual GOAT. And with Messi having played a little under half of Inter Miami\u2019s games so far this season as they won the Supporters\u2019 Shield (regular season championship), a weird debate is currently raging in the USA USA USA over whether a four-month absence from his club side before, during and after this summer\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica should render him ineligible when it comes to voting with regards the Landon Donovan Award <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/17/lionel-messi-mvp-chances-inter-miami-mls\">for tournament MVP</a>. Given that most of his rivals for the title have packed far less into twice as many games, you\u2019d think Messi ought to be a shoo-in but whether he\u2019s that fussed about getting the nod ahead of such global superstars as Federico Bernardeschi, Luciano Acosta or Denis Bouanga \u2026 well, nobody can say for sure but he.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Sarah Rendell from 8pm BST for minute-by-minute updates from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live\">Twente 1-3 Chelsea</a> in Women\u2019s Big Cup.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI had the option of extending my stay at Liverpool but, after five years, I wanted to get more playing time elsewhere. I had several offers but I decided to sign for Bremen because Germany is a country I already know. I was also convinced by what the coach and management at Bremen had to say. I just wanted to play football, to be out on the pitch, making passes and scoring goals. If I wanted the money, I would have chosen to sign somewhere other than Bremen. Here, all that motivated me was to have the opportunity to play every weekend, enjoy myself and give pleasure.

I am now torn between wanting England to lose all their games so as to dismay those xenophobic fans and editors, or to win them all and reward the admirably composed (and well-qualified) Mr Tuchel. The latter, win-win option would have the extra merit of seeing reverse ferrets all round. And in any case, it is surely now written in the stars that England will win the next World Cup final by beating Germany thanks to a stoppage-time winner awarded by goalline technology\u201d \u2013 Trevor Field.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would have been interesting to see how the rag-tag, ultra-in-disguise that is the English tabloid press had reacted if J\u00fcrgen Klopp had gotten the job. As a Canadian national team supporter which previously had an Englishman (John Herdman) and now an American (Jesse Marsch) in charge \u2013 each of whom has taken the team to, for us, major successes (return to the World Cup after an absence of 36 years and the unprecedented semi-finals of Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024), I am happily unfussed by a \u2018foreigner\u2019 in charge.

      "bodyText": "HIGHS AND LOWS While last week\u2019s win by 10-man Bolivia over Colombia in an Air Miles World Cup qualifier might have raised a few eyebrows, it shouldn\u2019t really have come as much of surprise. Not content with the controversial advantage playing home games at high altitude in La Paz used to give them, the Bolivians have recently and quite literally cranked things up several notches. Moving another 560m uphill, they played their last two home games more than four kilometres above sea level at the Estadio Municipal de El Alto, where the air is so thin visiting teams might as well be trying to play in outer space. Sadly for La Verde, they also have to descend the Andes to play away from home and in this week\u2019s qualifier against the World Cup holders, they came seriously unstuck. Having spent most of his career being compared with Cristiano Ronaldo, it may have come to Lionel Messi\u2019s attention that his preening Portuguese nemesis marked the end of his participation in the current international break by throwing a comically petulant strop at the end of his side\u2019s scoreless draw with Scotland, yet another game in which he was bizarrely indulged by his manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez, despite his increasingly negligible contributions to the cause. By stark contrast, Messi chipped in with just the three goals and two assists as Argentina put Bolivia to the sword courtesy of a 6-0 win at the Estadio Monumental, in a game that was actually played 12 metres below sea level, a state of affairs that won\u2019t have suited their visitors at all. In scoring his 10th hat-trick for Argentina, Messi made it 112 international goals, which means the only person at that level to have scored more than him is that fella last spotted getting his radge on at Portugal being denied the opportunity to take a last-gasp corner at Hampden Park. With Argentina sitting pretty at the top of the South American World Cup standings, Messi was obviously asked if he\u2019d be hanging around to help them to defend their title in 2026. \u201cI didn\u2019t set any date or deadline about my future,\u201d he parped. \u201cI\u2019m just enjoying all this. I am more emotional than ever and taking all the love from the people because I know these can be my last games.\u201d Following his bravura performance against the mountain goats of Bolivia, the MLS Cup playoffs are next on the agenda for football\u2019s actual GOAT. And with Messi having played a little under half of Inter Miami\u2019s games so far this season as they won the Supporters\u2019 Shield (regular season championship), a weird debate is currently raging in the USA USA USA over whether a four-month absence from his club side before, during and after this summer\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica should render him ineligible when it comes to voting with regards the Landon Donovan Award for tournament MVP. Given that most of his rivals for the title have packed far less into twice as many games, you\u2019d think Messi ought to be a shoo-in but whether he\u2019s that fussed about getting the nod ahead of such global superstars as Federico Bernardeschi, Luciano Acosta or Denis Bouanga \u2026 well, nobody can say for sure but he.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI had the option of extending my stay at Liverpool but, after five years, I wanted to get more playing time elsewhere. I had several offers but I decided to sign for Bremen because Germany is a country I already know. I was also convinced by what the coach and management at Bremen had to say. I just wanted to play football, to be out on the pitch, making passes and scoring goals. If I wanted the money, I would have chosen to sign somewhere other than Bremen. Here, all that motivated me was to have the opportunity to play every weekend, enjoy myself and give pleasure. Unfortunately, things haven\u2019t gone according to plan\u201d \u2013 Naby Ke\u00efta gets his chat on with Ed Aarons, recalling the highs and lows of his Anfield career and clearing the air on discipline controversy at Werder Bremen. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Re: yesterday\u2019s Football Daily. I am now torn between wanting England to lose all their games so as to dismay those xenophobic fans and editors, or to win them all and reward the admirably composed (and well-qualified) Mr Tuchel. The latter, win-win option would have the extra merit of seeing reverse ferrets all round. And in any case, it is surely now written in the stars that England will win the next World Cup final by beating Germany thanks to a stoppage-time winner awarded by goalline technology\u201d \u2013 Trevor Field. It would have been interesting to see how the rag-tag, ultra-in-disguise that is the English tabloid press had reacted if J\u00fcrgen Klopp had gotten the job. As a Canadian national team supporter which previously had an Englishman (John Herdman) and now an American (Jesse Marsch) in charge \u2013 each of whom has taken the team to, for us, major successes (return to the World Cup after an absence of 36 years and the unprecedented semi-finals of Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024), I am happily unfussed by a \u2018foreigner\u2019 in charge. And we Canadians don\u2019t judge them on whether they can sing our anthem (in two languages, no less)\u201d \u2013 Michael Pearson. I like Thomas Tuchel primarily because he was involved in that wonderful example of scenes we do not like to see (but really do) with Antonio Conte while manager of Chelsea. But, for the life of me, I can\u2019t look at Herr Tuchel without thinking how much he resembles the effigy in Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream.

That\u2019s an awful lot of recent Chelsea managers switching to international management. Once is nothing, twice is interesting, three times is a pattern\u201d \u2013 Harriet Osborn. With all this talk of the \u2018Stand derby\u2019 between Exeter and Barnet in the FA Cup (yesterday\u2019s Football Daily letters), it appears everyone is forgetting about the team from last season\u2019s fifth round, Maidstone United, who have been drawn at Solihull Moors.

Originally intended for a streaming premiere, the $17m movie was elevated to a theatrical release after enthused test screenings, going on to make $217m worldwide, a huge win for Paramount and the genre at large. It was a slick, stylishly made attempt to update a familiar supernatural curse formula with the modern addition of a trauma narrative, a parasitic demon acting as a metaphor for the horror of inherited mental illness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/10/terrifier-3-review-killer-clown-is-tooled-up-for-third-helping-of-gleeful-gorefest\">Terrifier 3 review \u2013 killer clown is tooled up for third helping of gleeful gorefest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The film\u2019s creator, Parker Finn, showed flair as a director but flaws as a writer, unable to push his tonally awkward film far enough out of the shadow of both The Ring and It Follows and struggling with subtext that required a little more subtlety to cut as deep as his more effectively visceral use of gore.

      "bodyText": "When Smile, an original low-budget horror movie, became a surprise smash hit in 2022, it was a success story that was easier to admire than it was a film to rally behind. Originally intended for a streaming premiere, the $17m movie was elevated to a theatrical release after enthused test screenings, going on to make $217m worldwide, a huge win for Paramount and the genre at large. It was a slick, stylishly made attempt to update a familiar supernatural curse formula with the modern addition of a trauma narrative, a parasitic demon acting as a metaphor for the horror of inherited mental illness. The film\u2019s creator, Parker Finn, showed flair as a director but flaws as a writer, unable to push his tonally awkward film far enough out of the shadow of both The Ring and It Follows and struggling with subtext that required a little more subtlety to cut as deep as his more effectively visceral use of gore. A sequel was inevitable but also hard to imagine how it could be in any way justifiable, trotting out the same hellish endurance test for another unlucky victim. But in Smile 2, Finn has found a nifty way to repurpose his setup by shifting from a psychiatrist, haunted by her involvement in the death of her abusive mother, to a pop star, also haunted by the death of her actor boyfriend, and her addiction to both drugs and alcohol that may have played a part. The curse remains the same \u2013 someone kills themself in front of you while smiling and then you\u2019re it, plagued for six days with visions of creepily grinning people in your life until you then end your life as well. The previous film had ended with the protagonist\u2019s suicide in front of her love interest, who returns for a smart cold open that ties the two films together. It\u2019s passed on to low-level drug dealer Lewis (Lukas Gage), who is contacted one night by a desperate Skye Riley (the British actor Naomi Scott), a fallen pop singer about to embark on a brash comeback tour still crippled by both physical and emotional pain from a car accident a year earlier.

And then their violent disappointment as they slowly put two and two together and realise that instead of buying them Horrible Histories (a DVD of sophisticated yet child-friendly historical parody sketches from most of the people behind Ghosts), you have actually bought them Horrible History (the new limited edition four-DVD boxset of violent, decades-old kung fu movies by the Chinese director Chang Cheh).</p> <p>Maybe your children won\u2019t mind. Maybe they\u2019ve grown up watching the work of Chang Cheh, and they\u2019ll excitedly tell you that they hope the films in the box set can live up to the standard set by The Sword Stained with Royal Blood or The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires. More likely, though, they\u2019ll berate you for ordering something online without properly checking it first.</p> <p>In fairness to all parents, what on earth was this box set thinking?

      "bodyText": "Great news, parents! In just a few short weeks, a new Horrible History DVD will be released. Imagine the look of absolute delight on the faces of your children as they giddily unwrap their present and realise that their favourite CBBC show has created new material. And then imagine the growing look of horror on their faces as they scan the cover of the DVD case and see that the main image is a clenched fist and some spiked knuckledusters. And then their violent disappointment as they slowly put two and two together and realise that instead of buying them Horrible Histories (a DVD of sophisticated yet child-friendly historical parody sketches from most of the people behind Ghosts), you have actually bought them Horrible History (the new limited edition four-DVD boxset of violent, decades-old kung fu movies by the Chinese director Chang Cheh). Maybe your children won\u2019t mind. Maybe they\u2019ve grown up watching the work of Chang Cheh, and they\u2019ll excitedly tell you that they hope the films in the box set can live up to the standard set by The Sword Stained with Royal Blood or The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires. More likely, though, they\u2019ll berate you for ordering something online without properly checking it first. In fairness to all parents, what on earth was this box set thinking? None of the films contained within (Marco Polo, The Pirate, Boxer Rebellion and Four Riders) are called Horrible History.

I threw the rock, that\u2019s my heat. But when other people could get hurt, that\u2019s nerve-racking. But I got news for people: anybody that thinks controversy is a way to make money, it\u2019s not. You get a lot of buzz, but now you need lawyers. So don\u2019t just say something stupid and then back-pedal \u2013 if you\u2019re going to say something, stand on it.</p> <p><em> </em><strong>When you founded Body Count, a Black man performing heavy metal was pretty rare. Have you enjoyed the growing crossover between hip-hop and heavier music in recent years</strong><strong>, and the increasing diversity in genres such as hardcore and metal</strong><strong>? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/109235032?page=1#dmid=6334933e-2a03-4ebe-85ff-e67adb73748a\">MrPleebus</a></em><br>I didn\u2019t really care, I was just trying to do me. Of course, yes, it feels good to see the genre merge and change, but that wasn\u2019t my agenda. My agenda was simple: to play in a band with [guitarist] Ernie C. Touring in Europe with Public Enemy, I\u2019d noticed the kids would mosh off of fast rap and that\u2019s what sparked the idea to do Body Count, to do a fast rock band. It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cLet\u2019s get Black people in.\u201d It was just \u2026 I\u2019m going to do this shit.</p> <p><strong>How did it feel to put yourself in the shoes of a psychopath for your new album\u2019s lead single? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1360833?page=1#dmid=6334933e-2a03-4ebe-85ff-e67adb73748a\">VerulamiumParkRanger</a></em><br>That song sounded like I imagine a psychopath\u2019s brain would sound: very erratic, very crazy. One of the things I\u2019ve always loved to do is become people in my songs \u2013 like rapping from the perspective of a cop killer. So I just sat back and I tried to think like a psychopath. It wasn\u2019t really hard.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5UsCOzQAR0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n5UsCOzQAR0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>What was it like working with Mot\u00f6rhead for Born to Raise Hell?

Lemmy was cool, but I really didn\u2019t get to kick it with him. But the fact that he\u2019d requested me for the track \u2013 that\u2019s all I needed to know. He was a legend.</p> <p>Usually<strong> </strong>our collabs come from knowing people and being friends. Like Amy Lee from Evanescence came about because Vince [Price, bass] was working with them on the road. Having Dave Gilmour on the new record was a long shot, though. It started with me wanting to do Comfortably Numb, because I believe right now we <em>are</em> all comfortably numb \u2013 you can watch someone get set on fire on television and then just start watching the football game. We did the song and Pink Floyd\u2019s publisher just said \u201cno, no way\u201d. My manager reached out to David Gilmour, and the next thing we get a call saying: \u201cI want to play on the record.\u201d I\u2019m sure there\u2019s purists that might hate the song, but fuck them.</p> <p><strong>Is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMoKK7BV2mc\">Body Count in the house</a>? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1466082?page=1#dmid=6334933e-2a03-4ebe-85ff-e67adb73748a\">\u200b\u200bIvanBunin77</a></em><br>Yeah, definitely. We\u2019ve been back in the house ever since [2014\u2019s] Manslaughter. Once we connected with [producer] Will Putney we caught our second wind. We had a low moment because we lost some band members and that\u2019s going to hurt any band, but we got our groove back.</p>    <p><strong>On your debut Lollapalooza run you regularly performed Sly &amp; the Family Stone\u2019s Don\u2019t Call Me N*****, Whitey with Jane\u2019s Addiction.

      "bodyText": "Was there ever a moment during the furore over Cop Killer when you were feeling the heat and/or questioning yourself over releasing it? Sophisticles I never really questioned myself, but the heat came when they started sending bomb threats to Warner Bros. I threw the rock, that\u2019s my heat. But when other people could get hurt, that\u2019s nerve-racking. But I got news for people: anybody that thinks controversy is a way to make money, it\u2019s not. You get a lot of buzz, but now you need lawyers. So don\u2019t just say something stupid and then back-pedal \u2013 if you\u2019re going to say something, stand on it. When you founded Body Count, a Black man performing heavy metal was pretty rare. Have you enjoyed the growing crossover between hip-hop and heavier music in recent years, and the increasing diversity in genres such as hardcore and metal? MrPleebus I didn\u2019t really care, I was just trying to do me. Of course, yes, it feels good to see the genre merge and change, but that wasn\u2019t my agenda. My agenda was simple: to play in a band with [guitarist] Ernie C. Touring in Europe with Public Enemy, I\u2019d noticed the kids would mosh off of fast rap and that\u2019s what sparked the idea to do Body Count, to do a fast rock band. It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cLet\u2019s get Black people in.\u201d It was just \u2026 I\u2019m going to do this shit. How did it feel to put yourself in the shoes of a psychopath for your new album\u2019s lead single? VerulamiumParkRanger That song sounded like I imagine a psychopath\u2019s brain would sound: very erratic, very crazy. One of the things I\u2019ve always loved to do is become people in my songs \u2013 like rapping from the perspective of a cop killer. So I just sat back and I tried to think like a psychopath. It wasn\u2019t really hard. What was it like working with Mot\u00f6rhead for Born to Raise Hell? Did you keep in touch with Lemmy? AllThisRunningAround The fact Lemmy even knew who I was was dope. Lemmy was cool, but I really didn\u2019t get to kick it with him. But the fact that he\u2019d requested me for the track \u2013 that\u2019s all I needed to know. He was a legend. Usually our collabs come from knowing people and being friends. Like Amy Lee from Evanescence came about because Vince [Price, bass] was working with them on the road. Having Dave Gilmour on the new record was a long shot, though. It started with me wanting to do Comfortably Numb, because I believe right now we are all comfortably numb \u2013 you can watch someone get set on fire on television and then just start watching the football game. We did the song and Pink Floyd\u2019s publisher just said \u201cno, no way\u201d. My manager reached out to David Gilmour, and the next thing we get a call saying: \u201cI want to play on the record.\u201d I\u2019m sure there\u2019s purists that might hate the song, but fuck them. Is Body Count in the house? IvanBunin77 Yeah, definitely. We\u2019ve been back in the house ever since [2014\u2019s] Manslaughter. Once we connected with [producer] Will Putney we caught our second wind. We had a low moment because we lost some band members and that\u2019s going to hurt any band, but we got our groove back. On your debut Lollapalooza run you regularly performed Sly &amp; the Family Stone\u2019s Don\u2019t Call Me N*****, Whitey with Jane\u2019s Addiction. Has the time passed when Black and white artists can duet on such a culturally weighted song? McScootikins I don\u2019t really fuck around with people that are worried about getting cancelled. Somebody once said: \u201cIce-T is the only person who does things that totally jeopardise his career just to stay awake.\u201d But if we\u2019re not going to push the line, then why even make the song? It should rub some people wrong. Do you have Charlton Heston pompously reciting Body Count lyrics \u2013 as he famously did at that Warner Bros shareholders meeting \u2013 as your ringtone? Haigin88 Fuck him. You know what we did? We made a gold record for him. We thanked him for talking shit because it got us a lot of attention.

Ryburn said she had knocked on more than 5,000 doors in the electorate and felt there was still strong support for the Liberals. She named development, infrastructure and cost of living as her priorities, and said if elected she would fight Labor\u2019s transport-oriented development scheme, which encourages higher-density living around train stations. In the tight race, Scruby is focused on many of the same issues as her opponent. \u201cI\u2019m not taking anything for granted,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are disappointed at the state of the Liberal party, and not just the circumstances of this election, but also the administrative bungle that impacted the Northern Beaches as well.\u201d Asked about independent MP Alex Greenwich\u2019s equality bill, which would enable transgender people in NSW to change their sex on their birth certificates without surgery, Ryburn said she shared the Liberal party\u2019s concerns. Scruby said she would have looked at the bill closely, and likely supported it. Much of the debate before the byelection has centred around which woman would more effectively advocate for the community. Ryburn would join the opposition as a backbencher, which she points out would put her in a big voting bloc. Meanwhile, Scruby said as an independent and more progressive politician she could effect greater change, pointing to the successes of other crossbenchers including Wakehurst MP Michael Regan. The premier, Chris Minns, said on Monday that his government worked with parliamentarians from \u201cevery ideological background\u201d and that he had worked well with the independents. While polls are tight, electoral analyst Ben Raue said he saw Scruby as \u201cthe favourite\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a big campaign,\u201d he said. If Ryburn managed to win, he said, it would be \u201cvery impressive\u201d. \u201cI can see why they really want to make sure that there\u2019s somewhere for her \u2026 but I think probably she\u2019s working with the very unfavourable conditions,\u201d he said.",

It has appeared in television advertisements and other campaign material to refer to young people in the justice system. Crisafulli and the LNP\u2019s use of the term does not refer specifically to Aboriginal children.</p> \n<p>But online the term \u201cuntouchables\u201d is often used in anti-crime communities \u2013 including before it was used by the LNP \u2013 as a reference to Indigenous children.</p> \n<p>The deputy opposition leader, Jarrod Bleijie, said the party was using the term in reference to all repeat young offenders and would continue to do so.<br><br>\u201cWe have a repeat generation of young offenders who think they are untouchable by the laws, because Labor weakened the youth justice laws, and we will continue to say it,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cWhen we refer to it, we refer to all young offenders.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Fear and panic take hold</h2> \n<p>Crisafulli began spruiking Queensland\u2019s \u201cyouth crime crisis\u201d in early 2021, a few months after becoming opposition leader.</p> \n<p>A search of Hansard records and LNP media statements shows the term was used a handful of times prior to the 2020 state election; but from March 2021 onwards, the phrase began to be repeated regularly \u2013 hundreds of times \u2013 by shadow ministers and opposition MPs as they sought to make youth justice a political issue.</p> \n<p>Several serious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/10/vyleen-white-stabbing-death-granddaughter-racial-tension-queensland\">high-profile incidents</a>, and some data suggesting an <a href=\"https://www.qfcc.qld.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-06/Exiting%20youth%20detention%20report%20June%202024.pdf\">increase in recidivism rates</a> and spikes in certain offences, have helped the notion of a crimewave take hold.</p> \n<p>But claims that the situation represents a crisis is refuted by most experts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/09/evidence-refutes-claims-of-youth-wave-former-queensland-childrens-court-boss-says\">including the former children\u2019s court president John Robertson</a>, and is not supported by statewide crime data, which shows youth crime rates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/02/queensland-police-data-shows-youth-at-near-record-lows-so-why-the-tough-on-election-talk\">at near-record lows</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/02/queensland-police-data-shows-youth-at-near-record-lows-so-why-the-tough-on-election-talk\">Queensland police data shows youth crime at near-record lows. So why the \u2018tough on crime\u2019 election talk?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Crisafulli has claimed that Labor\u2019s changes to the Youth Justice Act in 2015 \u201cwatered down\u201d consequences for young people and created a \u201cgeneration of untouchables\u201d or \u201crepeat untouchables\u201d.</p> \n<p>But since 2012-23, <a href=\"https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/news/2024/07/26/queensland-police-service-release-latest-crime-statistics-for-2023-24-financial-year/#:~:text=Data%20reveals%20a%20reduction%20in,18%25%20since%202012%2F13.\">the rate of unique child offenders has decreased by 18%</a>. Queensland also locks up record numbers of children \u2013 more than most other states and territories combined, and more than the state ever has before.</p> \n<p>In the face of the evidence, fear and panic about youth crime has taken hold. Polling has shown the LNP on course to win the state election, largely on the back of swings in regional areas, where law and order concerns are most prominent.</p> \n<p>In four years as opposition leader, Crisafulli\u2019s tactics have been to amplify individual incidents and community discontent. At almost every press conference he holds about youth crime, the opposition leader is accompanied by a victim who is encouraged to tell their story.</p> \n<p>Last week, after the LNP announced it would establish \u201creset\u201d camps for at-risk young people who have never committed a crime, the party\u2019s campaign team distributed CCTV footage of a break-in to media outlets.</p> \n<p>Crisafulli\u2019s social media videos include <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/1217550325831754\">clips of him reacting with disgust to TV news reports</a> about crime.</p> \n<p>He often posts campaign videos direct to Facebook community anti-crime groups.</p> \n<p>\u201cG\u2019day it\u2019s David Crisafulli here, I\u2019m the opposition leader in Queensland,\u201d says one video from March, posted in multiple crime groups.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery single day we are contacted by locals in your area impacted by crime. It\u2019s out of control and it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Young people at risk</h2> \n<p>Amid the heightened political debate and community sentiment about youth crime, concerns are growing that the narrative places young people at risk. Children living in care homes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/01/storm-the-house-queensland-care-home-receives-threats-after-being-wrongly-identified-as-halfway-house\">have been the subject of death threats</a>, and vigilantes have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/08/mob-surrounding-rockhampton-home-blocked-by-police-amid-tensions-over-youth\">surrounded the homes of Aboriginal children</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/31/queensland-house-burned-down-in-suspected-vigilante-attack-was-subject-of-social-media-posts-calling-for-violence\">torched the home of two girls accused of a serious assault</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou only have to look at what happened in Rockhampton, [where a group of vigilantes] went to the house where they thought a young person was living \u2026 it\u2019s scary,\u201d Yow Yeh says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we look at the stats and the research that comes out we know that youth offending has been decreasing and it makes you wonder what political parties are wanting to achieve when they do [claim crime has increased].</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know the most vulnerable in our society are our young people. It\u2019s scary to think that people will run with these notions and take things into their own hands.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt almost gives these vigilante groups permission to be more brazen and emboldened in their actions.\u201d</p> \n<p>The public commentary often speaks about youth offenders in quite general terms. On social media, debate in anti-crime groups can be highly racialised and more extreme. Indigenous children are referred to by codewords: \u201cskinny ankle kids\u201d and \u201cuntouchables\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dr Bartholomew Stanford, a Torres Strait Islander man and political science lecturer at Griffith University, says Indigenous Australians had been demonised through colonial settlement as \u201cviolent and uncivilised\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday that perspective helps to perpetuate stereotypes about [them], the most egregious being that Indigenous youth have some propensity towards crime,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe issue is socioeconomic and is exacerbated through their continued marginalisation from society.\u201d</p> \n<p>The LNP and Crisafulli were offered the opportunity to comment, but did not respond to questions.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Cruel\u2019 and ineffective</h2> \n<p>The LNP\u2019s youth crime campaign has been so successful it has almost become politically poisonous to challenge the notion that crime is out of control.</p> \n<p>Last year, victims of crime called for the Labor MP Don Brown to be sacked for comments claiming youth crime was \u201ca media beat-up\u201d. He was quickly shot down by senior ministers.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou will have all seen me acknowledge, repeatedly acknowledge, how real the community\u2019s concern is,\u201d Steven Miles, the then deputy premier, said in response.</p> \n<p>When Miles told Guardian Australia that TV news was \u201caddicted to CCTV footage of crime\u201d, an image of the headline was posted to Instagram by Crisafulli.</p> \n<p>\u201cLives have been lost, Queenslanders are living in fear, and this Premier thinks the Youth Crime Crisis is a media beat-up,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>With the opposition leading in the polls, the state government has responded with piecemeal pivots to the right. It has twice suspended the Human Rights Act, to introduce a criminal offence for young people breaching bail conditions, and to allow children to be lawfully held in police watch houses.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year the government removed the international principle of \u201cdetention as a last resort\u201d from the Youth Justice Act. Yow Yeh says both parties\u2019 rhetoric and policies have been concerning.</p> \n<p>The LNP is now proposing sentencing children as adults \u2013 \u201cadult time for adult crime\u201d \u2013 and sending at-risk children with no criminal record to \u201creset\u201d boot camps. Both policies have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/07/queensland-lnp-david-crisafulli-criticised-over-cruel-plan-to-sentence-some-youth-offenders-as-adults\">labelled \u201ccruel\u201d</a> and ineffective.</p> \n<p>In Ipswich on Tuesday, Crisafulli told reporters on the campaign trail that Labor MPs were still \u201cburying their heads in the sand\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m going to call it out,\u201d Crisafulli said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are now past the halfway mark of the campaign and the government has not said \u2018youth crime crisis\u2019 once.\u201d</p> \n<p>Crisafulli seems intent on saying it, over and over again, until polling day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The day after the Liberal National party announced its centrepiece youth justice plan \u2013 to sentence children to \u201cadult time\u201d \u2013 the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, flew to north Queensland to campaign. At his press conference, Crisafulli introduced an 81-year-old woman whose car and purse were stolen in the Townsville suburbs. He put his hand on her shoulder as she recounted being confronted and pushed to the ground by a group of \u201cmongrels\u201d. \u201cAll these people should be locked up and then throw the key away,\u201d the woman said. \u201cIf they repeat, get rid of them altogether. Put them in a coffin. That\u2019s my way of thinking. I know it\u2019s not right, but there\u2019s just too much of that going on.\u201d Youth crime has become a totemic issue in Queensland before next week\u2019s state election, critical to the LNP\u2019s dominant lead in opinion polls and central to its pitch to voters. But while data suggests youth crime rates are at near-record lows, an examination of the LNP\u2019s rhetoric and campaigning tactics shows how the opposition has pushed the notion of a \u201cyouth crime crisis\u201d, then pitched itself as a hardline solution. Indigenous academics and other experts this week accused Crisafulli of \u201cdog whistling\u201d and sowing division over the LNP\u2019s campaign slogan, labelling kids a \u201cgeneration of untouchables\u201d. Concerns are mounting that the political debate has taken a dangerous turn. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to see some of the rhetoric,\u201d says Kevin Yow Yeh, a Wakka Wakka and South Sea Islander man, and a principal researcher at the Institute for Collaborative Race Research. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about the safety of all young people. I\u2019m not sure people who are using this rhetoric are appreciating the very real world consequences.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The term has been used regularly by the opposition leader and LNP candidates. It has appeared in television advertisements and other campaign material to refer to young people in the justice system. Crisafulli and the LNP\u2019s use of the term does not refer specifically to Aboriginal children. But online the term \u201cuntouchables\u201d is often used in anti-crime communities \u2013 including before it was used by the LNP \u2013 as a reference to Indigenous children. The deputy opposition leader, Jarrod Bleijie, said the party was using the term in reference to all repeat young offenders and would continue to do so. \u201cWe have a repeat generation of young offenders who think they are untouchable by the laws, because Labor weakened the youth justice laws, and we will continue to say it,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cWhen we refer to it, we refer to all young offenders.\u201d Fear and panic take hold Crisafulli began spruiking Queensland\u2019s \u201cyouth crime crisis\u201d in early 2021, a few months after becoming opposition leader. A search of Hansard records and LNP media statements shows the term was used a handful of times prior to the 2020 state election; but from March 2021 onwards, the phrase began to be repeated regularly \u2013 hundreds of times \u2013 by shadow ministers and opposition MPs as they sought to make youth justice a political issue. Several serious high-profile incidents, and some data suggesting an increase in recidivism rates and spikes in certain offences, have helped the notion of a crimewave take hold. But claims that the situation represents a crisis is refuted by most experts, including the former children\u2019s court president John Robertson, and is not supported by statewide crime data, which shows youth crime rates at near-record lows. Crisafulli has claimed that Labor\u2019s changes to the Youth Justice Act in 2015 \u201cwatered down\u201d consequences for young people and created a \u201cgeneration of untouchables\u201d or \u201crepeat untouchables\u201d. But since 2012-23, the rate of unique child offenders has decreased by 18%. Queensland also locks up record numbers of children \u2013 more than most other states and territories combined, and more than the state ever has before. In the face of the evidence, fear and panic about youth crime has taken hold. Polling has shown the LNP on course to win the state election, largely on the back of swings in regional areas, where law and order concerns are most prominent. In four years as opposition leader, Crisafulli\u2019s tactics have been to amplify individual incidents and community discontent. At almost every press conference he holds about youth crime, the opposition leader is accompanied by a victim who is encouraged to tell their story. Last week, after the LNP announced it would establish \u201creset\u201d camps for at-risk young people who have never committed a crime, the party\u2019s campaign team distributed CCTV footage of a break-in to media outlets. Crisafulli\u2019s social media videos include clips of him reacting with disgust to TV news reports about crime. He often posts campaign videos direct to Facebook community anti-crime groups. \u201cG\u2019day it\u2019s David Crisafulli here, I\u2019m the opposition leader in Queensland,\u201d says one video from March, posted in multiple crime groups. \u201cEvery single day we are contacted by locals in your area impacted by crime. It\u2019s out of control and it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d Young people at risk Amid the heightened political debate and community sentiment about youth crime, concerns are growing that the narrative places young people at risk. Children living in care homes have been the subject of death threats, and vigilantes have surrounded the homes of Aboriginal children and torched the home of two girls accused of a serious assault. \u201cYou only have to look at what happened in Rockhampton, [where a group of vigilantes] went to the house where they thought a young person was living \u2026 it\u2019s scary,\u201d Yow Yeh says. \u201cWhen we look at the stats and the research that comes out we know that youth offending has been decreasing and it makes you wonder what political parties are wanting to achieve when they do [claim crime has increased]. \u201cWe know the most vulnerable in our society are our young people. It\u2019s scary to think that people will run with these notions and take things into their own hands. \u201cIt almost gives these vigilante groups permission to be more brazen and emboldened in their actions.\u201d The public commentary often speaks about youth offenders in quite general terms. On social media, debate in anti-crime groups can be highly racialised and more extreme. Indigenous children are referred to by codewords: \u201cskinny ankle kids\u201d and \u201cuntouchables\u201d. Dr Bartholomew Stanford, a Torres Strait Islander man and political science lecturer at Griffith University, says Indigenous Australians had been demonised through colonial settlement as \u201cviolent and uncivilised\u201d. \u201cToday that perspective helps to perpetuate stereotypes about [them], the most egregious being that Indigenous youth have some propensity towards crime,\u201d he says. \u201cThe issue is socioeconomic and is exacerbated through their continued marginalisation from society.\u201d The LNP and Crisafulli were offered the opportunity to comment, but did not respond to questions. \u2018Cruel\u2019 and ineffective The LNP\u2019s youth crime campaign has been so successful it has almost become politically poisonous to challenge the notion that crime is out of control. Last year, victims of crime called for the Labor MP Don Brown to be sacked for comments claiming youth crime was \u201ca media beat-up\u201d. He was quickly shot down by senior ministers. \u201cYou will have all seen me acknowledge, repeatedly acknowledge, how real the community\u2019s concern is,\u201d Steven Miles, the then deputy premier, said in response. When Miles told Guardian Australia that TV news was \u201caddicted to CCTV footage of crime\u201d, an image of the headline was posted to Instagram by Crisafulli. \u201cLives have been lost, Queenslanders are living in fear, and this Premier thinks the Youth Crime Crisis is a media beat-up,\u201d he wrote. With the opposition leading in the polls, the state government has responded with piecemeal pivots to the right. It has twice suspended the Human Rights Act, to introduce a criminal offence for young people breaching bail conditions, and to allow children to be lawfully held in police watch houses. Earlier this year the government removed the international principle of \u201cdetention as a last resort\u201d from the Youth Justice Act. Yow Yeh says both parties\u2019 rhetoric and policies have been concerning. The LNP is now proposing sentencing children as adults \u2013 \u201cadult time for adult crime\u201d \u2013 and sending at-risk children with no criminal record to \u201creset\u201d boot camps. Both policies have been labelled \u201ccruel\u201d and ineffective. In Ipswich on Tuesday, Crisafulli told reporters on the campaign trail that Labor MPs were still \u201cburying their heads in the sand\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m going to call it out,\u201d Crisafulli said. \u201cWe are now past the halfway mark of the campaign and the government has not said \u2018youth crime crisis\u2019 once.\u201d Crisafulli seems intent on saying it, over and over again, until polling day.",

      "bodyText": "Liam Payne\u2019s family and stars from across the music world have led tributes to the former One Direction star after his death at a hotel in Argentina. \u201cWe are heartbroken. Liam will forever live in our hearts and we\u2019ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul,\u201d his family said in a statement issued on Thursday. Medics confirmed the death of the 31-year-old after he fell from a balcony into the courtyard of the CasaSur hotel in the Palermo neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The X Factor \u2013 where Payne had his first audition as a 14-year-old and was later placed with other contestants in 2010 in the band that made his name \u2013 said that he would \u201cleave a lasting legacy on the music industry\u201d. The former X Factor host Dermot O\u2019Leary shared an Instagram photo of him and a teenage Payne on stage, describing him as \u201ca joy\u201d who \u201chad time for everyone, [was] polite, grateful, and was always humble\u201d. He added: \u201cThe worst news. I remember him as a 14-year-old turning up to audition on The X Factor, and blowing us away singing Sinatra. He just loved to sing.\u201d Others remembering him included Ronnie Wood, the Rolling Stones guitarist, who recalled performing alongside Payne and One Direction for a performance of the boyband\u2019s track Where Do Broken Hearts Go on The X Factor in 2014. \u201cI am shocked and saddened to hear of the death of Liam Payne. It was a pleasure to work with him on our X Factor performance,\u201d Wood wrote on Instagram. The Grammy-winning pop star Charlie Puth, who co-wrote Payne\u2019s 2017 solo track Bedroom Floor, mourned Payne as a \u201cmajor artist\u201d. \u201cI am in shock right now,\u201d Puth wrote in a series of Instagram stories featuring a photo of the pair together in the studio. \u201cLiam was always so kind to me. He was one of the first major artists I got to work with. I cannot believe he is gone \u2026 I am so upset right now, may he rest in peace.\u201d Listeners to BBC Radio 1 on Thursday morning heard Greg James opening his breakfast show by telling listeners the news had been \u201cunbearably sad\u201d to wake up to and that he would be processing it with them. \u201cIt might be the first time someone you\u2019ve idolised has died and that\u2019s a really strange thing to get your head around. So go easy on yourself today because it\u2019s a shock, it\u2019s destabilising,\u201d he said, addressing Payne\u2019s fans. \u201cEven though you may not have not known Liam Payne personally, we do have these parasocial relationships where we do know these people to a certain extent and they are part of our lives, and when they\u2019re gone that\u2019s weird to deal with.\u201d The singer Olly Murs, who starred on The X Factor a year before One Direction, said on Instagram that he was \u201clost for words\u201d, describing Payne\u2019s death as \u201cdevastating\u201d. \u201cWe always had a good laugh when we saw each other, sometimes the catch-ups were only short and sweet but when we did it was mostly about how annoyingly good his hair always looked, or our love for Becks, the old XF (X Factor) days and the tour we shared together,\u201d Murs wrote beside a picture of him and Payne. Among collaborators who paid their respects was the German DJ Zedd, who made the 2017 song Get Low with Payne and said on X: \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is real \u2026 absolutely heartbreaking.\u201d The rapper Juicy J, who featured on an unreleased demo titled You, posted: \u201cRIP Liam Payne wow I can\u2019t believe it prayers up for the family.\u201d Lou Teasdale, a hair and makeup artist who worked extensively with One Direction on tour, said on X: \u201cSending you all so much love.\u201d The Irish pop duo Jedward, who competed in The X Factor one season before One Direction, wrote on X: \u201cRIP Liam Payne condolences to friends and family\u201d. They also posted a follow-up \u201csending strength\u201d to Payne\u2019s family, including his former partner and X Factor judge Cheryl as well as their seven-year-old son, Bear. Musicians and friends from outside the X Factor world also paid tribute. \u201cSo upsetting to hear the news,\u201d Paris Hilton tweeted. \u201cSending love and condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. RIP my friend.\u201d The author EL James said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d. Payne had previously contributed the song For You with Rita Ora to the soundtrack of Fifty Shades Freed, the film adaptation of the final book in James\u2019s Fifty Shades trilogy. The British pop star Mabel posted to her Instagram story: \u201cFor so many years I always knew I could call you for support and big brotherly advice but now you\u2019re gone.\u201d She continued: \u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with Liam\u2019s family and friends during this time you\u2019ll be so missed.\u201d",

The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said he would step down from the position in the summer of 2025 to take up the role as the provost of Queen\u2019s College, Oxford. One of the leading authorities on tax and spending policy in Britain, Johnson is regarded as a significant figure in shaping policy, with the ear of the chancellor and MPs from across the political spectrum. Having led the IFS since January 2011, he holds significant influence in economic policymaking, with the thinktank occupying a pivotal role as an arbiter on government budgets and other tax and spending decisions. However, the thinktank, which was founded in 1969, has also faced criticism for reinforcing orthodox approaches to economic policymaking, and for focusing heavily on tax and spending issues at the expense of wider social considerations. Johnson is well known for his commentary in the media on the UK public finances and decisions taken in the budget, including his recent critiques of planned tax and spending measures in the chancellor\u2019s set piece on 30 October. This month, the IFS director suggested Rachel Reeves would need to \u201cgrasp the nettle\u201d to balance the books with \u00a325bn in tax increases, if she wanted to meet her goal of ensuring no return to austerity while balancing day-to-day expenditure with tax receipts.

      "body": "<p>For the past year, as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, eviscerated one US-imposed \u201cred line\u201d after another in Israel\u2019s brutal war on Gaza, Joe Biden and his feckless administration insisted that they did not want the conflict to spread to neighboring Lebanon and beyond. But over the past month, Netanyahu and his government launched an all-out war against Lebanon, with intensive airstrikes throughout the country and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. More than 1 million people <a href=\"https://www.unrefugees.org/news/unhcr-lebanon-crisis-deepens-as-israeli-airstrikes-intensify/\">have been displaced</a>, as Israel expands its assault on what it claims are Hezbollah \u201cstrongholds\u201d.</p> <p>And how has Biden responded to Netanyahu\u2019s latest obstinacy and constant humiliation of the US administration? Biden keeps sending more US weapons and military support to Israel. On Sunday, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/13/biden-thaad-missile-defense-israel/\">Pentagon announced</a> that it was deploying one of its most advanced missile defense systems to Israel, along with about 100 American troops to operate it. This will be the first time that Washington has openly deployed US forces to Israel since Netanyahu\u2019s government launched its war on Gaza after last October\u2019s attack by Hamas militants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/15/israel-united-nations\">Israel is a rogue nation. It should be removed from the United Nations | Mehdi Hasan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden is sending US forces into a foreign conflict three weeks before a US presidential election, where his vice-president and Democratic successor, Kamala Harris, is facing the former president Donald Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-harris-foreign-policy-poll-46540a9a\">has made gains</a> with swing state voters by pledging to scale back US military involvement overseas. By deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, and its crew to Israel, Biden is embroiling the US more deeply in a regional conflict that Netanyahu has largely instigated over the past year. The system is designed to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles, and it\u2019s intended to help Israel defend against potential Iranian missile attacks.</p> <p>It\u2019s the latest example of Biden failing to impose any consequences on Netanyahu as he expands the Gaza war into a regional one \u2013 with an invasion of Lebanon and a new confrontation with Iran. On 1 October, Iran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-vows-to-retaliate-after-iran-launches-unprecedented-missile-attack\">launched a barrage</a> of more than 180 ballistic missiles against Israel, with Tehran saying it was retaliating for a series of devastating Israeli attacks on Hezbollah, the linchpin of Iran\u2019s so-called \u201caxis of resistance\u201d and the most powerful militia and political party in Lebanon. Israel killed Hezbollah\u2019s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/israel-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah\">in an airstrike</a> on southern Beirut on 27 September.</p> <p>Israel vowed to retaliate for the recent Iranian missile strike, risking a wider regional war that could draw the US into a direct conflict with Iran and its network of allied militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq. The Biden administration has tried to impose new \u201cred lines\u201d on Netanyahu and his rightwing government, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/israel-iran-oil-nuclear-sites-retaliation.html\">urging Israel not to attack</a> Iran\u2019s oil production or nuclear enrichment sites, which could trigger a harsh Iranian response and spiral into a larger confrontation. Israeli officials <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-oil-nuclear-sites-biden-f5dd702de7d990dd1d00f665e1484dee\">reportedly told</a> the US that they would avoid targeting Iran\u2019s oil, infrastructure and nuclear sites.</p> <p>But over the past year, Netanyahu has broken multiple promises to Biden to restrain Israeli attacks on Gaza, and more recently in Lebanon. The Israeli premier repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-19/ty-article/.premium/new-evidence-reveals-netanyahus-relentless-efforts-to-block-hostage-deal-report-shows/00000192-0a79-d1bc-a1ff-2e7fe0420000\">sabotaged negotiations</a> for a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas in Gaza, and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/26/lebanon-israel-ceasefire-deal-netanyahu\">backed out</a> of an agreement last month with the US and France for a temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Pentagon\u2019s decision to deploy its THAAD missile defense system, along with US troops, in Israel could embolden Netanyahu to yet again undermine the Biden administration with an extensive Israeli attack on Iran. Despite insisting he doesn\u2019t want a wider war, Biden keeps rewarding Netanyahu for broadening the conflict and assuring him that the US will bail out Israel no matter what it does.</p> <p>The costs of US military support for Israel since last October are staggering \u2013 and have been largely <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/06/us-weapons-israel-gaza/\">shielded from public scrutiny</a> as the Biden administration used various methods to speed up arms shipments and avoid review by members of Congress. Washington has sent Israel nearly $18bn in weapons and other assistance over the past year, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-us-military-spending-8e6e5033f7a1334bf6e35f86e7040e14\">according to a report</a> compiled by Brown University\u2019s \u201cCosts of War\u201d project. On top of direct aid to Israel, the US has incurred $4.8bn in additional<strong> </strong>military spending in the Middle East due to the conflict.</p> <p>That the Biden administration has spent <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2024/USspendingIsrael\">at least $22.7bn</a> in its efforts to bolster Netanyahu\u2019s government might surprise many US taxpayers who are footing the bill at a time when Washington is struggling to tame inflation \u2013 and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) lacks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/04/fema-funding-hurricane-season\">enough funding</a> to make it through the rest of this year\u2019s hurricane season. By far, Washington is the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, providing at least $3.8bn in military aid per year. Israel is the largest <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts\">cumulative recipient</a> of American foreign aid in the world, having received about $310bn (adjusted for inflation) since the Jewish state was founded in 1948.</p> <p>After last year\u2019s Hamas attack, Biden declared his absolute support for Israel and its leaders. But it quickly became apparent that Biden\u2019s \u201cbear hug\u201d strategy \u2013 where the US president hoped to influence Netanyahu behind the scenes \u2013 would fail spectacularly, as the Israeli leader undermined and humiliated Biden at every opportunity. For most of that time, Biden avoided the most direct path to averting a wider conflict: using US weapons transfers to pressure Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire in Gaza, where <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/sigrid-kaag-securitycouncil-briefing-16sep24/\">Israel has killed</a> more than 41,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly 90% of the population.</p> <p>But Biden consistently refused to use the leverage he had over Netanyahu \u2013 and when you don\u2019t use leverage, you lose it. Biden allowed Netanyahu to checkmate him ahead of a US presidential election, and to seize on unconditional US support to launch a devastating war against Lebanon in an effort to destroy Hezbollah. Israel is using the same playbook it has used in Gaza to wreak havoc on Lebanon, a country smaller than Connecticut: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-deaths.html\">large-scale aerial bombardment</a> and displacement of civilians, followed by a ground invasion.</p> <p>A day after last October\u2019s attack by Hamas, Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones into northern Israel, in what the group\u2019s leaders described as an effort to lend support for Palestinians and divert Israeli military resources from Gaza. Israel retaliated with heavy airstrikes and artillery shelling across southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, largely Shia Muslim areas where Hezbollah draws its base of support.

      "bodyText": "For the past year, as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, eviscerated one US-imposed \u201cred line\u201d after another in Israel\u2019s brutal war on Gaza, Joe Biden and his feckless administration insisted that they did not want the conflict to spread to neighboring Lebanon and beyond. But over the past month, Netanyahu and his government launched an all-out war against Lebanon, with intensive airstrikes throughout the country and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. More than 1 million people have been displaced, as Israel expands its assault on what it claims are Hezbollah \u201cstrongholds\u201d. And how has Biden responded to Netanyahu\u2019s latest obstinacy and constant humiliation of the US administration? Biden keeps sending more US weapons and military support to Israel. On Sunday, the Pentagon announced that it was deploying one of its most advanced missile defense systems to Israel, along with about 100 American troops to operate it. This will be the first time that Washington has openly deployed US forces to Israel since Netanyahu\u2019s government launched its war on Gaza after last October\u2019s attack by Hamas militants. Biden is sending US forces into a foreign conflict three weeks before a US presidential election, where his vice-president and Democratic successor, Kamala Harris, is facing the former president Donald Trump, who has made gains with swing state voters by pledging to scale back US military involvement overseas. By deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, and its crew to Israel, Biden is embroiling the US more deeply in a regional conflict that Netanyahu has largely instigated over the past year. The system is designed to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles, and it\u2019s intended to help Israel defend against potential Iranian missile attacks. It\u2019s the latest example of Biden failing to impose any consequences on Netanyahu as he expands the Gaza war into a regional one \u2013 with an invasion of Lebanon and a new confrontation with Iran. On 1 October, Iran launched a barrage of more than 180 ballistic missiles against Israel, with Tehran saying it was retaliating for a series of devastating Israeli attacks on Hezbollah, the linchpin of Iran\u2019s so-called \u201caxis of resistance\u201d and the most powerful militia and political party in Lebanon. Israel killed Hezbollah\u2019s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an airstrike on southern Beirut on 27 September. Israel vowed to retaliate for the recent Iranian missile strike, risking a wider regional war that could draw the US into a direct conflict with Iran and its network of allied militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq. The Biden administration has tried to impose new \u201cred lines\u201d on Netanyahu and his rightwing government, urging Israel not to attack Iran\u2019s oil production or nuclear enrichment sites, which could trigger a harsh Iranian response and spiral into a larger confrontation. Israeli officials reportedly told the US that they would avoid targeting Iran\u2019s oil, infrastructure and nuclear sites. But over the past year, Netanyahu has broken multiple promises to Biden to restrain Israeli attacks on Gaza, and more recently in Lebanon. The Israeli premier repeatedly sabotaged negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas in Gaza, and backed out of an agreement last month with the US and France for a temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Pentagon\u2019s decision to deploy its THAAD missile defense system, along with US troops, in Israel could embolden Netanyahu to yet again undermine the Biden administration with an extensive Israeli attack on Iran. Despite insisting he doesn\u2019t want a wider war, Biden keeps rewarding Netanyahu for broadening the conflict and assuring him that the US will bail out Israel no matter what it does.

By far, Washington is the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, providing at least $3.8bn in military aid per year.

It\u2019ll all be over tomorrow either way, Pakistan will level the series with one to play or England will win it with a run chase for the ages. Again. Can both of those things be true? I\u2019m not sure, but I am tired. Tired but happy. We\u2019ll be back in the wee small hours to do it all over again. Thanks for your company and comments and ta to Rob Smyth for doing the graveyard stint. I\u2019ll leave on the below email from an OBO reader that put a shot in the arm and a smile on the face. Goodbye! If ESPN\u2019s ball by ball coverage is the New York Times of cricket then The Guardian\u2019s OBO is the New Yorker with its *close* to real time, long form commentary on the beautiful game. Love tuning into y\u2019all\u2019s coverage. For cricket literature, the OBO section of the Guardian is like TMS. Love your team\u2019s work. It should never cease.\u201d Salman Agha was the man of the day with a counter-punching 63 runs that are worth at least 1.5 x more according to my patented OBO run converter machine. He\u2019s just spoken to Sky Sports: It\u2019s always nice to score runs for your team, I wanted to stay positive and play my shots. Lot of things happening out there, there will be one ball that gets you out. When you\u2019re at the crease, you have to score runs. I enjoy batting with the tail at number 7. I used to complain but now it\u2019s something I have to accept!\u201d A fascinating day of Test cricket. Both sides still in with a chance of victory but Pakistan the favourites by a decent stretch. We haven\u2019t seen a Ben Stokes special in a while though have we? NEWSFLASH: It will not be a draw That\u2019ll do. With men around the bat Ollie Pope doesn\u2019t miss out and reverse-sweeps the final ball of the day from Sajid Khan for four. Phew. Pakistan\u2019s day, a gruelling one for England. Set up nicely for day nine four tomorrow. 11th over: England 36-2 (Pope 21, Root 12) 10th over: England 29-2 (Pope 18, Root 8) Pope clips for two and Root drives elegantly for a single. One over left, is there some last gasp drama to be wrung out of this captivating day of Test criggit? 9th over: England 26-2 (Pope 15, Root 8) A single each to Root and Pope. I can\u2019t help but feel Zain Malik is after my job\u2026 \u201cA crumbling pitch. Flood lights on. The ball turning and drifting like a Toyota Supra. Spinners from both ends. A chase is on. The hunt is on. Pakistan need 8 wickets, England need 280. This has been the ultimate leveller of bat and ball. Who would\u2019ve thought that \u201csame pitch, same time\u201d would mean such a different contest. Pakistan\u2019s to lose from here. The spectacle of Test Cricket. A sight to behold indeed.\u201d Lovely stuff. Next over is yours, Zain? Things have calmed down a little out there\u2026 8th over: England 24-2 (Pope 14, Root 7) England seem to have one eye on the close now with just over five minutes remaining. Root glides a single past point and Pope is content to join the dots for the rest of the over. 7th over: England 23-2 (Pope 14, Root 6) Pope sweeps for four! Lofted over square leg, gets a decent piece of it and releases the tension just a smidge. Pakistan implore for an lbw off the final ball but it was heading down the leg side. No review plumped for by Masood and wisely so. Mike Jakeman has got his stirring spoon out\u2026 \u201cHi James, whatever the result of this match, the Pakistani selectors have played a blinder, haven\u2019t they? Sajid has eight wickets and counting (as well as vital second-innings runs) and Kamran has made a century. Babar who?\u201d 6th over: England 17-2 (Pope 9, Root 5) Root clips for two off his pads and then blocks out Noman Ali with a straight bat, on the front foot and smothering the spin with his bat, a tea towel on a chip pan fire. 5th over: England 15-2 (Pope 9, Root 3) Sajid Khan targets the stumps and pads with the new ball, driving it in and skidding it off the surface. Root and Pope collect singles. Here\u2019s the Crawley wicket. Flight and guile. 4th over: England 12-2 (Pope 8, Root 1) Root is off the mark with a cut to third. Just kidding, it was a sweep to leg. Sun dipping in Multan. About twenty minutes left in the day. England could effectively lose this game in that time. Gone gone gone! Lovely piece of bowling from Noman Ali who flights it above the eyes to draw Crawley out of his crease and the turn leaves the Kent man marooned. Rizwan whips off the bails and holds the pose for emphasis! England in trouble early doors in this chase, here comes Joe Root. 3rd over: England 11-1 (Crawley 3, Pope 8) England go broom broom. More sweeps, reverse and regular. Solid defence too as Sajid Khan spears the ball into the surface. 2nd over: England 8-1 (Crawley 1, Pope 7) The left arm of Noman Ali is met by a host of Ollie Pope sweeps and a searing drive into the covers that is incredibly well stopped, goalkeeper style, Pakistan\u2019s decibel count goes up another notch. This is enthralling. 1st over: England 6-1 (Crawley 1, Pope 5) Do not adjust your set. The chatter round the bat is optimal as Pope arrives at the crease. Sheeesh! A sweep for four second ball from the Surrey man. England won\u2019t take a backward step and neither will Pakistan with a first win in seven matches in the offing. Death by sweep! Duckett falls in the first over to a cross batted swipe off Sajid Khan. Big blow to start England\u2019s chase as their first innings centurion perishes in the first over. A rootle through the OBO mailbag: \u201c200+ to chase in the 4th innings on this track is impossible! Only one team can chase that ...Oh!\u201d says Krishnamoorthy. \u201cLucky dog you to get the so-called graveyard shift. This game, and this session, is already riveting, and will only become more so. Can I just say how great it is to see two tailenders knowing how to run between wickets, turnover the strike, irritate the field and generally provide such clever entertainment as well? Not always a stand-out feature of Pakistani batting, historically, but this effort is right up there. Such a great game.\u201d Very true, Gervase Greene. \u201cHi James. So England need 300. Pah, Brook got that many himself not long ago. Mind you, it wasn\u2019t a Day 9 pitch. A hundred from any English batter in this chase would be as good as a triple\u2026\u201d Simon McMahon\u2019s maths. \u201cYour reporting is VERY SLOW, you can improve A LOT\u201d says Rosemary MALTUS Smith. Capitals authors own. What a world. Potts gets one to lift and take the glove and suddenly it is all over bar the chasing. Top effort from Salman and Sajid Khan, they\u2019ve pushed this run chase from the file marked \u201cincredibly tricky\u2019\u201d into the one along \u2013 \u201cPretty improbable\u201d. England will rue those two dropped chances when Salman was on 4 and 6 and the lead was less than 200. In fact, what am I talking about, they won\u2019t be thinking about that at all now, the pads are being strapped on and the willow lasers set to 297. It won\u2019t be dull whatever happens. 58th over: Pakistan 221-9 (Khan 22, Mahmood 0) Wicket maiden for Carse, he\u2019s suffering from the effort and a niggle in his left leg. he has 2-29 from his nine overs and looks like he\u2019s just run nine marathons. In a row. \u201cEngland\u2019s effort has been unstinting\u201d says Mike Atherton on the commentary. Carse gets his reward finally! A short ball is slashed in the air by Salman and Stokes takes the simple catch at mid-wicket. What a knock by Salman Agha, he walks off with 63 to his name and that is potentially worth double that in the context of the game. His teammates rise on the balcony and administer plenty of backslaps as he heads back to the changing room. He\u2019s got Pakistan up to a really commanding position in this match \u2013 the lead is 296 and there\u2019s one wicket left to take for England. 57th over: Pakistan 221-8 (Salman 63, Khan 22) Potts keeps chugging in, just two off the over but Pakistan\u2019s lead has stretched to 296. The dropped catches, overturned edges and phantom nicks have all conspired to sap Stokes\u2019 side under the afternoon sun. Do they have anything left they can pull out of the well to help get themselves off the park? 57th over: Pakistan 219-8 (Salman 62, Khan 21) Now then, Ben Stokes is told by the umpires that there\u2019s a glitch with the DRS technology so for the time being we\u2019re going old skool \u2013 the umpires decision is final. Would you believe it! Carse slides one past Sajid Khan and England are certain they heard an edge\u2026 a huge appeal but given NOT OUT by umpire Dharmasena on the field. That\u2019s the end of that too as the machines have gone dicky. 56th over: Pakistan 214-8 (Salman 62, Khan 16) \u201cBashir has to buy a ticket there\u201d says Ian Ward as the young spinner failed to put a dive in and attempt to catch a Khan hoick into the deep on the leg side. I\u2019m not sure if he didn\u2019t pick it up or if it was a tired effort/preservation of those spinning fingers. Salt, meet wound. Potts keeps the ball full and is absolutely hammered through cover for four by Salman Agha. Time for a drink, England need one. Nurse, the electrolytes! Your runs are burning holes through me\u2026 Potts slams a full bunger into Sajid Khan\u2019s front pad and bellows himself hoarse with the appeal! After an age Umpire Dharmasena raises the finger! Potts has got the breakthrough Hang on, Khan reviews and there is a spike on the snicko. NOT OUT! England look utterly crestfallen. 55th over: Pakistan 208-8 (Salman 57, Khan 15) Well fielded! Ben Duckett saves five runs by catching and then juggling a big hit from Sajid Khan down to long on. Replays show Duckett managed to get rid of the ball before his foot made contact with the boundary sponge. Every little helps. Might be time for some pace? Pakistan looking extremely comfortable against spin at the moment. 54th over: Pakistan 206-8 (Salman 56, Khan 14) Leach is taken for three runs as the pain continues for England. 53rd over: Pakistan 203-8 (Salman 55, Khan 12) 200 up for Pakistan as Bashir is milked for seven off the over. England, of course, will believe that they can chase whatever is set but the last half an hour has been a bruising one for them. Batting will get a little harder with each over they remain in the field. 52nd over: Pakistan 196-8 (Salman 55, Khan 8) The partnership stretches to 40 runs and the lead to 271. Gulp. Fifty for Salman Agha! He dances down the track and lofts Leach back over his head for SIX! Crucial innings for his side, dropped twice early on and he\u2019s making England pay. Get on your dancing shoes, you sexy little swine consummate professional! 51st over: Pakistan 189-8 (Salman 49, Khan 7) Stokes sticks with Bashir. What an experience this is for the young spinner. Test match on the line, batters looking to smear him every ball, each run crucial. Absorbing stuff. Bashir does well, mixes up his pace, challenges the edge and concedes just four runs. 50th over: Pakistan 185-8 (Salman 46, Khan 6) Leach gets some big turn and bounce, oooh err. Pakistan\u2019s many spinners licking their lips at the sight of that. Imagine Mick Jagger chowing down on a juicy peach. Or don\u2019t. 260 runs suddenly looks a long way away\u2026 49th over: Pakistan 181-8 (Salman 45, Khan 5) Bashir has a leg slip in place, almost acting as a fielder to stop the tickle off the legs. Sure enough he goes back a few paces and stops a certain four. Sigh of relief from England who have been under the cosh since they took that last wicket. Test match cricket at its finest. Three runs off the over. 48th over: Pakistan 178-8 (Salman 43, Khan 4) Leach once more and Salman Agha hits back for Pakistan! A slog sweep brings four over square\u2026 and again! Salman plunders 15 off the over which really hurts England. This partnership is suddenly 22 runs off 11 balls and Pakistan lead by 253. It was Salman that was dropped twice by the way, on 4 and 6 by Smith and Root. He\u2019s now the man inflicting the damage on England, potentially taking the game out of their reach. 47th over: Pakistan 163-8 (Salman 29, Khan 3) All happening now in Multan, England looking to polish off Pakistan and the home side trying to eke as many runs as possible. \u201cEngland really need to switch on here\u201d says Nasser Hussain as Salman looks to open his shoulders. Thirty of forty runs here put the game well into Pakistan\u2019s hands, at the minute the game is in the balance - Pakistan lead by 337. Bashir strikes with his first ball after tea! Flighted and drifts away from the left-handed Noman Ali. Enticing the drive and taking the edge. Stokes doing the business at slip. Pakistan are now eight down \u2013 leading by 231 runs. 46th over: Pakistan 156-7 (Salman 25, Noman Ali 1) A loud groan from Stokes as four byes evade Jamie Smith behind the stumps and run away for four. It was a leg side spear from Stokes but every run is vital now. 45th over: Pakistan 150-7 (Salman 22, Noman Ali 0) The tunes are blaring out in Multan. You won\u2019t wanna miss a thing. Bowled him! Don\u2019t play back to that! Leach slides one through the defences and England have another. Pakistan\u2019s lead is 225, three wickets left. Quicker delivery from Leach who celebrated with gusto! 44th over: Pakistan 147-6 (Salman 22, Jamal 0) Stokes keeps things tight, just a single off his latest. \u201cLoving this!\u201d says Dan on email \u201cBut hardly able to keep a side eye on it thanks to you-know-what. Excuse for later on, after my company-administered flu jab, will be, \u201cneed to put my feet up for an hour, that needle\u2019s sapped all my vim away...\u201d Isn\u2019t that a Neil Young lyric, Dan? 43rd over: Pakistan 146-6 (Salman 21, Jamal 0) Aamer Jamal joins Salman in the middle. Door creaking open for England. They need four more wickets to finish Pakistan off. The lead is 222 runs. A knife\u2019s edge you say? Pitched in line\u2026 missed the bat, missed the gloves, hits the pad andf would have knocked out middle stump! Jack Leach strikes after tea for England! Big wicket. Not given on the field but Leach was adamant and he was proved right by DRS. England\u2019s slow horse rides again! Phil Withnall is hooked up to the beautiful poison down in New Zealand\": \u201cEvening Jim, it\u2019s late here in Queensland, I\u2019ve been up since 4 this morning and will need to do so again tomorrow. I\u2019m tired. However there are two hypnotically fascinating Test\u2019s playing out and I feel obligated to cram in a few more overs before retiring. I apologise to anyone that has contact with me in the morning...\u201d Props to you and your eyebags, Phil. 42nd over: Pakistan 145-5 (Saud 31, Salman 21) Ben Stokes rubs the ball up and down Brydon Carse\u2019s sweaty flanks to get the ball shined up. DH Lawrence esque scenes in Multan. Stokes played by Oliver Reed, obviously. Shot! Salman pulls a short ball away to the leg side boundary, more pain for England. Two more worked behind square, the ball will need to be polished up once more\u2026 Oh Brydon! 41st over: Pakistan 139-5 (Saud 31, Salman 15) Five runs off the first over back after the tea interval. Jack Leach is paddled and swept, flicked and fetched. \u201cAn absolutely vital couple of hours in front of us\u201d says Mike Atherton on the tv commentary, a man not known for his hyperbole. There\u2019s a lot of things at stake in this final session. England\u2019s players will be taking some much needed fluid on board ahead of a huge final session on day three. Remember, Pakistan have lost their last six Test matches, after a trot like that you can almost forget how to get over the line. The home side are well on top but a flurry of wickets after tea and a target of less than 250 brings England right back into it. England\u2019s run chase will then of course be box office viewing\u2026 either way. Meanwhile, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s err totally normal? Do yourself a favour why don\u2019t you? Brew yourself a cup of something strong and settle in to watch this. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. Majestic. Shoaib Bashir twirls through the final over before tea. Salman and Saud Shakeel are watchful, both playing down the line of the ball. Each takes a single to see out the session. A bruising end to it for England with that brace of clangers off Brydon Carse a few moments ago. 91 runs added by Pakistan for the loss of two wickets. 40th over: Pakistan 134-5 (Saud 30, Salman 12) 39th over: Pakistan 132-5 (Saud 29, Salman 11) A couple of overs to go before tea. England looking a bit ragged, plenty of players looking in need of a splosh of Earl Grey or a plunge in an ice bath. Stokes stitches together a maiden. 38th over: Pakistan 132-5 (Saud 29, Salman 11) Gargantuan effort from Carse who also seems to be struggling with his left boot, or has he picked up an injury? He could just be completely spent but we\u2019ll keep an eye on him. A no ball off the final delivery doesn\u2019t help him and Zak Crawley trots over from mid-off to give him a pat on the back. HashtagTeamSpirit. Pakistan keep working the singles and each run is now smarting that little bit more for England. 37th over: Pakistan 128-5 (Saud 28, Salman 9) Ben Stokes does what he does in times of need and decides that the time has come for him to bring himself on. He turns away in something verging on disgust as a quick single is pinched off his second ball. Those drops and the burgeoning target are weighing heavy, Pakistan lead by 200 now. Brydon Carse looks out on his feet but is coming back for another over. Test cricket is brutal. 36th over: Pakistan 124-5 (Saud 27, Salman 6) My oh my what an over! Brydon Carse sees TWO CATCHES DROPPED off his over. Stokes shows a very rare sign of frustration and screams towards the skies as the second chance hits the dirt. Carse can\u2019t believe it either. Jamie Smith got the cymbals out for the first regulation edge from Salman and two balls later Joe Root spilled a slightly harder but still eminently graspable opportunity at first slip. Huge over in the course of the match as the Pakistan lead creeps towards 200. Ben Stokes\u2019 plans worked with the reversing ball but his fielders have failed to see them through. 35th over: Pakistan 120-5 (Saud 26, Salman 4) Potts probes away hitting a handkerchief sized spot outside off stump. Just a Salman single off the over. Kenneth Surin is tuned in: \u201cI\u2019m in my late 70s, hearing not the best. When he delivers the ball Potts seems to yell a 4-letter expletive beginning with F? If so, isn\u2019t this unsportsmanlike conduct?\u201d I think it is a grunt, Kenneth, of the sort a tennis player emits during a rally. He seems to do it every ball, not just when bowling the effort ball. Though every ball is an effort in these conditions and I\u2019m sure the odd expletive slips out! Hark at this! The Black Caps running amok against India in Bengalaru: 34th over: Pakistan 119-5 (Saud 26, Salman 3) The Durham pace pincer movement continues as Carse bustles in. Dust, heat and frosted tips. More signs of a reversing ball as a length delivery scuds back into Salman\u2019s pads. The new batter then rides the bounce on a back of a length ball, fending it behind square for a couple of runs. The next ball pitches and dies a thousand deaths into the surface, spluttering to a long barrier unfurling Jamie Smith behind the sticks. This is Day Eight after all\u2026 Thanks Rob, hello all. Phew. It\u2019s getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes actually remain garmented but strap in for what is shaping up to be a enthralling few hours of Test cricket. Pakistan lead by 190 runs with five wickets left in the sheds as Matthew Potts gets the ball to reverse swing and scythes new batter Salman in two. Don\u2019t go anywhere will you? 33rd over: Pakistan 115-5 (Saud 25, Salman 0) 32nd over: Pakistan 114-5 (Saud 24, Salman 0) Right, that\u2019s all from me \u2013 Jim is here for the rest of this pulsating day\u2019s play. Brilliant from Brydon Carse, just brilliant. He has got the dangerous Rizwan once again, having worked him over superbly during that short spell. Rizwan was hit on the back thigh by a big inswinger, missed a slightly weird shot across the line and then edged to Root at slip. The wicket ball was wider and could have been ignored, but Rizwan \u2013 rattled by another intimidating interrogation from Carse \u2013 poked instinctively at it. 31st over: Pakistan 112-4 (Saud 24, Rizwan 21) A third bowling change in as many overs. Matthew Potts comes on and zips his first ball past Rizwan\u2019s outside edge. To hell with orthodoxy, decides Rizwan. He charges Potts to flat bat a boundary over mid-off, then goes again to slug four more through midwicket. Ben Stokes applauds after both deliveries, believing that a wicket is in the post. England certainly need one because this is getting away from them. In their different ways, Pakistan\u2019s middle order of Kamran, Saud and Rizwan have batted superbly. 30th over: Pakistan 103-4 (Saud 24, Rizwan 12) Brydon Carse is coming on after drinks. This feels like England\u2019s penultimate roll of the dice. Rizwan greets him with a wild hack across the line. Where did that come from? He missed it completely but could easily have dragged on. After a couple of solid defensive strokes, Rizwan plays tip and run to mid-off. Shakeel digs out a yorker and then hits short mid-on with a crisp clip off the pads. 29th over: Pakistan 102-4 (Saud 24, Rizwan 11) Joe Root replaces Leach and almost strikes first ball. Saud is squared up by a jaffa that tunrs from middle and leg to take the edge, with the ball dropping short of Pope in the gully. Saud\u2019s response is a firm sweep to the midwicket boundary, an accomplished shot to bring up the 100. He\u2019s playing jolly well. 28th over: Pakistan 96-4 (Saud 19, Rizwan 10) There\u2019s still plenty of turn for England, but maybe it\u2019s getting slower as the ball ages. Pakistan look as comfortable at any stage in this innings, and Rizwan cuts Bashir for a couple to move into double figures. 27th over: Pakistan 94-4 (Saud 19, Rizwan 8) So far Rizwan has been busy rather than aggressive, looking for singles at every opportunity. At the other end Shakeel is handling the spinners with impressive ease. It might be time for Big Brydon, although there\u2019s risk in that because the quicker bowlers are more hittable on this pitch. \u201cOne of the hilariously incongruent aspects of David Gower commentating alongside his erstwhile Sky colleagues is that (unlike them) he is required by the host broadcaster employing him to peddle the various \u2018seamless\u2019 drop-in sponsor messages such as for solar energy, bank accounts, tea and washing machines,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cWell it keeps me amused.\u201d Gower makes the best of a bad job with his playfulness, doesn\u2019t he? Imagine if Beefy was asked to do something similar back in the day. Or Fred Trueman. 26th over: Pakistan 91-4 (Saud 18, Rizwan 6) England enquire for LBW when Rizwan is beaten on the inside by an excellent delivery from round the wicket. Rizwan was a long way forward and there were doubts on both height and line. This has been Pakistan\u2019s session so far: 11 overs, 48 runs, one wicket. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cWhile we\u2019re talking about Sugababes and cover versions, this effort by Scottish folk rockers Skipinnish is up there with the most unusual. England maybe wish they could bring yesterday evening back around \u2026\u201d 25th over: Pakistan 89-4 (Saud 17, Rizwan 5) Pakistan\u2019s run rate in this innings is around 3.5 per over, which is good going on such a tricky pitch. Saud charges Leach and chips nicely for a single; I think Leach saw him coming but Saud\u2019s hands got him out of any trouble. Rizwan also comes down the pitch to drive a more comfortable single, then Shakeel sweeps a third. Pakistan lead by 164. 24th over: Pakistan 86-4 (Saud 15, Rizwan 4) \u201cThis Test is one of those rare examples of the sequel being better than the original,\u201d says Mike Jakeman. \u201cFor all the plaudits given to Brook and Root for their endurance and concentration in Multan 1, as a spectacle this is so much better.\u201d 23rd over: Pakistan 82-4 (Saud 13, Rizwan 2) Stokes must be slightly tempted to go back to Carse, who has harassed Rizwan in this series, but two spinners feels like the right approach for now. Saud reverse sweeps adroitly for a single, then Rizwan saunters down the pitch to drive the fourth and final run of Leach\u2019s over. \u201cSurviving these early morning shifts, my beamish boy?\u201d whispers Robert Smith. There is only love in my generous heart but I\u2019m gonna have to gainsay this: \u2018I\u2019ve never batted on a 12th-day pitch but I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s much fun.\u2019 This sent me immediately down a much-loved imaginative path \u2013 Apocalyptic Cricket. Cricket defiantly played while the world ends around it \u2013 Wisden\u2019s Last Hurrah as the meteor makes landfall or the nukes finally sweep us off the tablecloth of the planet (I ranted about it in this first para in these hallowed pages some years ago. \u201cNot sure why but it has always seemed to me that actual Armageddon would almost certainly be accompanied by a bunch of truculent cricket tragics somewhere giving it their last. It might need a sporting declaration or a bit of a slog but there\u2019s be something fitting about it, a valedictory touch. \u201cA 12th-day pitch would be invidious, flagrant and a risk to life and limb but it would also definitely be fun.\u201d You\u2019ve now got me imagining Armageddon in the Long Room at Lord\u2019s. There isn\u2019t enough gin in the world. 22nd over: Pakistan 78-4 (Saud 11, Rizwan 0) Bashir enquires for LBW and/or a catch at slip when Rizwan is beaten by a fine delivery from round the wicket. I don\u2019t think there was an inside edge and it was too high for the LBW. Lovely bowling though. Rizwan is a key man because he plays spin really well and he won\u2019t just hang around. If he bats for an hour, Pakistan probably win. 21st over: Pakistan 77-4 (Saud 10, Rizwan 0) That was a precious cameo from Kamran, 26 from 39 balls with five fours. It also showed his team-mates that you can play shots on this pitch, and you\u2019d expect the relentlessly positive Mohammad Rizwan to follow his lead. At the end of the previous over Kamran walked down the pitch with a huge smile on his face. He\u2019s waited so long for a chance in Test cricket and is relishing every minute. Amid the ruins of a largely miserable 2024, Pakistan may have found a player or two. He smashes another sweep for four, this time off Leach, and then cuts the next ball to the fence to take the lead past 150. Pakistan hit only four boundaries in the first 18 overs; Kamran has doubled that total in the last three. His calculated aggression is giving England a headache. Correction: it was giving England a headache. Leach has the last word with a ball that skids on to beat Kamran\u2019s defensive push and hit him in front. He reviews a little indulgently, hoping he got outside the line. He did not. 20th over: Pakistan 67-3 (Kamran 18, Saud 9) Saud edges Bashir just \u2013 and I mean just \u2013 short of Pope at gully. When he takes a single, Kamran slog-sweeps high over midwicket for another boundary. This is terrific batting, intelligent, skilful and courageous. He\u2019s always scanning the field, working out the safest scoring options. \u201cIf they started playing entire Test series on the same pitch, which has its merits in terms of sustainability etc, can you just imagine the state of the Hollies Stand by day 25 of the Ashes?\u201d says Phil Russell. Hang on, are we playing all five Tests back to back as well? It\u2019s one way to solve the scheduling problem I suppose. 19th over: Pakistan 60-3 (Kamran 14, Saud 8) Stokes continues to tinker, bringing Leach back in place of Bashir. The impressive Kamran, who looks like he\u2019s batting on a different pitch, sweeps firmly for four. Pakistan lead by 135. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent tune for Duckett,\u201d says Ollie Glick. \u201cWondered if you knew (as I found out this year) that Freak Like Me is a direct cover of the Adina Howard song of 1995? Who knew!\u201d So you watch those old Top of the Pops repeats on BBC Four as well? I\u2019m the same as you, I had no idea till I saw it on there. Yep. India chose to bat in helpful seam-bowling conditions and were skittled by Matt Henry (5 for 15) and William O\u2019Rourke (4 for 22). It\u2019s their lowest ever total at home. 18th over: Pakistan 56-3 (Kamran 10, Saud 8) Carse continues. Nasser Hussain reckons it\u2019s because of the arrival of Shakeel, who is much more comfortable against spin. The tactic so nearly works when Shakeel edges through Root at first slip for four runs. He top-edged a cut stroke that flashed past Root\u2019s left shoulder before he could react. An almost impossible chance. \u201cOne of the great things about England cricket at the moment is that the powers-that-be have decided that the team permits players to not have perfect hours as long as they can provide instances of brilliance,\u201d says Mark Slater. \u201cFor far too long fast bowlers were dropped in favour of medium pacers who kept it straight and just short of a length \u2013 now you have ones who can go at five or six an over a spell and just concentrate on getting a snorter defended to gully. Should be the same for spinners. I think Shoaib Bashir will get to be an economic bowler, if he persists, because batsmen will become wary of that wicket-taking delivery that can happen any moment. Personally, I would love it if he is the bowler to rip through the Pakistani batsmen today.\u201d In 20 years\u2019 time Rob Key will be recognised as one of the important people in English cricket history, discuss. 17th over: Pakistan 50-3 (Kamran 10, Saud 2) Bashir resumes after taking the first three wickets before lunch. It looks Pakistan are going to be positive, which has to be the best approach on a dodgy pitch, and they take three singles from the over. The last ball is a beauty which spits at Kamran from well wide of off stump. He does well to drop it short of the man at short leg. \u201cThey really pressed fast forward at tea yesterday, eh,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem totally out of the question that this game could be over by the close. I guess even a runway turns on day 8, Rob. Still, it\u2019s been great to see Bashir adjust his line after watching the Pakistan bowlers. With his height he\u2019s going to create real problems. And he\u2019s still ridiculously young. But I can\u2019t see England chasing more than about 190. But my god it\u2019ll be exhilarating, like a slap in the face at 4am (when we\u2019re 106 all out).\u201d In 12.2 overs. 16th over: Pakistan 47-3 (Kamran 9, Saud 0) Carse hits the pitch really hard, which would make a nightmare to face on an uneven pitch, so you can understand why Stokes has had a look. But it might also be a chance for Pakistan to counter-attack. Kamran drives in the air and just short of cover, where the diving Stokes does well to save at least two runs. There\u2019s nothing anyone can do when Kamran pulls smoothly behind square for four. Carse may not be given a second over; he didn\u2019t do much wrong but nor did the pitch. \u201cGame nicely poised with Pakistan ahead on points, I\u2019d say,\u201d writes Dave Clark. \u201cThe second Test is a more even contest between bat and ball. A third Test on the same strip would be one for the bowlers, which begs the question, why not play an entire series on the same strip? Just toss up once before the first Test, then alternate. I can see no downside.\u201d Four days of lost revenue? I\u2019ve never batted on an 12th-day pitch but I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s much fun. The first over of the afternoon session will be bowled by\u2026 Brydon Carse. Interesting. \u201cI was leaning towards a Pakistan win,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cHowever, having just checked the India-New Zealand score (India 46 for 9) I feel anything is possible and nothing makes sense anymore. Long live Test cricket!\u201d India won the toss as well. I suppose they had to bat first after picking three spinners and only two quicks, although Bumrah and Shami might have routed New Zealand on their own. Very Old Trafford 1999. \u201cThe Ciderabad Duo of Leach and Bashir looking very much at home on this \u2018Taultan\u2019 surface,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cNasser seems to be genuinely loving the spectacle, too. For my part I can\u2019t wait to see how England might tackle a chase of say 250 or so - I suspect Duckett\u2019s inside edge could use a brush attachment for all the sweeping he\u2019s likely to be attempting.\u201d If Duckett sweeps an improbable matchwinning hundred, he should release a Sugababes cover. Let me lay it on the line I got a little sweepiness inside And you know Pakistan Has gotta deal with it I don\u2019t care what they say I\u2019m not about to play nobody\u2019s way Cause it\u2019s all about the slog in me Mm-hmm I wanna sweep in the morning Sweep in the evening\u2026 Anyone? No? \u201cCould this runchase be made for Bazball?\u201d wonders David Howell. \u201cThe clear indication from this session is that the pitch has made it to the point of unavoidable wickets being basically a given...\u201d says And, by implication, perhaps the logic in even the least time-constrained chase is to hit out before you get out. It\u2019s like how Tyson Fury beat Deontay Wilder twice; instead of spending the whole contest dodging the devastating blow, try and land it yourself. \u201cIf that is the logic Stokes et al. bring to the fourth innings, it\u2019s going to be one heck of a ride.\u201d I agree; they\u2019ll absolutely love this challenge. England certainly won\u2019t die wondering. They might die sweeping but that will be the key shot. Ben Duckett\u2019s innings feels really important because he could scramble Pakistan\u2019s brains very quickly. What do we think? I\u2019d have it maybe 70/30 in Pakistan\u2019s favour at the moment. Something to read during the lunch break 15th over: Pakistan 43-3 (Kamran 5) Those three wickets have kept them in the hunt for another absurd victory. And while they\u2019ll probably need a mad masterpiece to compare with Ollie Pope\u2019s 196 at Hyderabad if they are to win, the batters will be up for the challenge. Shoaib Bashir strikes with the last ball before lunch! Saim Ayub, who battled so hard to survive, pushed forward defensively and edged to Pope in the gully. Another really nice bit of bowling from Bashir. His control is far from perfect but he has bowled several jaffas and has figures of 3 for 27. 14th over: Pakistan 37-2 (Saim 17, Kamran 4) Leach changes ends to replace Bashir (6-0-21-2), and his first ball is a stunning delivery that bets Kamran all ends up. It curved onto middle stump before snapping past the outside edge. \u201cAbsolutely unplayable\u201d says Mike Atherton on Sky. Kamran smiles at the inherent futility of existence impossibility of playing a ball like that. Leach beats Kamran again with the last ball of an excellent maiden. 13th over: Pakistan 37-2 (Saim 17, Kamran 4) Nope, Root is going to continue. He goes around the wicket to the right-handed Kamran with two men at short midwicket. A leg-bye and three single from the over. It\u2019s been hard work but Pakistan have increased their lead to 112. England won\u2019t want to chase anything more than 113 200. 12th over: Pakistan 33-2 (Saim 15, Kamran 3) Bashir turns another terrific delivery past Saim\u2019s outside edge. His control is far from perfect but when he lands it right he looks such a threat. The first-innings centurion Kamran Ghulam gets off the mark with a really good reverse sweep for three. That\u2019s good batting, in both intent and execution. 11th over: Pakistan 28-2 (Saim 13, Kamran 0) Saim skids back to back cut Root for three, his best attacking shot to date. Root was probably brought on because there were two left-handers at the crease, and though he looks threatening it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see Leach back on for an over before lunch. 10th over: Pakistan 25-2 (Saim 10, Kamran 0) Beautifully bowled by Shoaib Bashir. Shan closed the face on a delivery that straightened sharply to take the edge, and Ollie Pope did the rest in the gully. Bashir growls in celebration; he\u2019s doubled his wicket tally for the series in half an hour. 9th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Saim 9, Shan 9) Twenty minutes to lunch. England would love to take another wicket or two before then. Joe Root, who can be lethal on dodgy pitches, replaces Jack Leach and beats the groping Saim with a quicker, wider delivery. Then he gets some extravagant turn and bounce from back of a length to Shan, who offers no stroke. All told, that\u2019s a pretty threatening first over. 8th over: Pakistan 21-1 (Saim 8, Shan 9) Shan cracks Bashir through extra cover for a couple, a nice shot and a sign that he is going to bat runs rather than time. Yes, that\u2019s a fair assumption: he charges the next ball and wallops it over mid-on for the first boundary of the innings. Bashir responds with a snorter that beats the outside edge. England go up confidently for caught behind but then don\u2019t review. Replays show it missed the bat by a distance and probably brushed the thigh. 7th over: Pakistan 15-1 (Saim 8, Shan 3) Saim gloves a sweep over the head of Smith for a couple of runs. That\u2019s twice he\u2019s done that already. In other news, India are 34 for 6 (S-I-X) in the first Test aginst New Zealand. They chose to bat in helpful bowling conditions and have been picked apart by Matt Henry and William O\u2019Rourke. 6th over: Pakistan 10-1 (Saim 5, Shan 1) Pakistan have had the third-innings blues so often that, even though they are objectively well on top in this game, they must be starting to fear another fiasco. It\u2019ll be interesting to see whether Shan Masood, who has been very positive against Bashir in particular, tries to counter-attack or just survive until lunch. He\u2019s gone! There was the slightest murmur on UltraEdge as the ball passed the inside edge and, after a bit of consideration, the third umpire decides that is sufficient evidence to give Shafique out. A big moment for England and especially Bashir. It was also a brilliant catch from Jamie Smith, the kind Ben Foakes would be proud to call his own. England review for caught behind Shafique pushes at a big-spinning delivery from Bashir, with Jamie Smith taking the ball superbly down the leg side. Did he glove it? 5th over: Pakistan 9-0 (Shafique 4, Saim 5) A full toss from Leach is clipped nicely for three by Shafique, then Saim looks suspiciously at the pitch after defending on the back foot. There\u2019s still plenty happening for the spinners. 4th over: Pakistan 6-0 (Shafique 1, Saim 5) Bashir\u2019s radar is slightly awry. When he gets it right he\u2019s a huge threat, as demonstrated when Saim misses a violent slog-sweep at a delivery that bursts from the surface. A pair of singles take Pakistan\u2019s lead to 81. 3rd over: Pakistan 4-0 (Shafique 0, Saim 4) Shafique pushes nervously at a lovely delivery from Leach that beats the edge and turns towards first slip. He\u2019s beaten again later in the over. Leach, who is very experienced at bowling on bunsens, has started with back-to-back maidens. 2nd over: Pakistan 4-0 (Shafique 0, Saim 4) Shoaib Bashir shares the new ball, so you can forget my hunch. His first turns extravagantly, albeit from well wide of the left-handed Saim\u2019s off stump. Saim top-edges a sweep over the head of Smith for two, then waves a couple more through the covers. 1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Shafique 0, Saim 0) Leach starts with a maiden to Shafique, including one beauty past the edge and another that draws a thick inside edge. So, who takes the new ball? I have a hunch it might be Root and Leach, with Bashir to follow. We\u2019re about to find out. \u201cNoman Ali has quietly hit the 50-wicket mark in Tests, and you wouldn\u2019t even know it, he\u2019s been slipping them into his pocket like loose change,\u201d says Zain Malik. \u201cA genuine workhorse, he\u2019s been grinding through the overs with zero fuss, like he\u2019s just running errands. Off the field, though, Noman\u2019s personality is anything but low key. He\u2019s the guy who probably believes he could bowl a marathon and then knock out a fifty before tea, always reminding folks that he\u2019s an all-rounder, at least in his own mind.\u201d He\u2019s the Ernie Wise to Sajid\u2019s Eric Morecambe, isn\u2019t he? The three wickets he took \u2013 Crawley, Stokes, Smith \u2013 were all proper batters and all came at key times. Stokes felt particularly important. That was the moment a drama turned into a crisis for England. Sajid Khan finishes the job with his seventh wicket. Bashir scuffs a sweep to midwicket, where the captain Shan Masood takes a good catch above his head. Sajid celebrates in the usual style and leads the team off. His figures are quite remarkable: 26.2-1-111-7. Pakistan lead by 75 runs. On this pitch, that\u2019s a helluva lot. 65th over: England 290-9 (Leach 24, Bashir 9) Leach spoons Noman just over the head of midwicket and scampers back for a second. There\u2019s a run-out referral but he\u2019s fine. This is now England\u2019;s highest partnership since the collapse started with the wicket of Joe Root last night: 28 from six overs. 65th over: England 287-9 (Leach 21, Bashir 9) Bashir gets down to sweep Sajid firmly for his first boundary. Cricket is a ridiculous game: last week Harry Brook scored a triple century, this week he\u2019s no better with the bat than Shoaib Bashir. \u201cMight one say that that England have let Noman (and Sajid) put asunder?\u201d says Tom Hopkins. \u201cThey\u2019re exposed, sitting ducks.\u201d 65th over: England 281-9 (Leach 20, Bashir 4) Leach is batting really well here. He slog-sweeps Noman for four more, with the man in the deep not picking the ball up, then charges down to hack a single behind square. This pair have added 18 useful runs. It\u2019s too early to stick a Union Jack flag in the window but they\u2019ve given England a snifter of hope. 64th over: England 274-9 (Leach 14, Bashir 3) Bashir just about survives another over from Sajid. Spare a thought for Zahid Mahmood, the third spinner, who has bowled only six overs and has had to watch Sajid and Noman clean up. He must feel like Tony McCarroll. \u201cJust how important is body language in Test cricket,\u201d says Zain Malik. \u201cComing into day eight, Rizwan chirping, Sajid strutting, \u2018thaapis\u2019 all round, Potts, who had given Salman quite the sending off being bowled through the legs. What a comeback from Pakistan. The purge seems to have paid off.\u201d 63rd over: England 272-9 (Leach 13, Bashir 2) Leach slog-sweeps Noman brilliantly for a one-bounce four to move into double figures \u2013 and bring England\u2019s deficit down into double figures. He does really well to not only keep out a grubber but also crack it through the covers for two more. \u201cShould Pakistan win this match, the strategy of playing two Test matches on the same pitch may become standard,\u201d says Krishnamoorthy V. \u201cWhy not extend it to the third match and see how it turns out?\u201d 62nd over: England 265-9 (Leach 6, Bashir 2) England have pulled off some astonishing come-from-behind victories in the Bazball era. If this win this it\u2019ll be right up there because the pitch is only going to get worse. \u201cSajid is going from strength to strength, his variations in speed totally outfoxing Carse,\u201d says Colum Fordham. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s been overlooked for the last few years, despite taking eight wickets against Bangladesh three years ago. Add to that his joyous celebrations and wonderfully moustachioed look and Pakustan may have struck gold.\u201d In defence of the selection committee (see preamble), his record apart from that 12-for v Bangladesh hasn\u2019t been great. But he looks a good bowler and clearly has the personality to thrive at this level. Like Shane Warne and a few others, he\u2019s a fast bowler trapped in the body of a spinner. 61st over: England 262-9 (Leach 5, Bashir 0) This England collapse is one for the books: they were 211 for 2 yesterday evening. It\u2019s vaguely reminscent of Headingley 1992, only without the reverse swing. And the eventual England victory. Nine down. Smith\u2019s first big shot is his last, a miscued straight drive that is comfortably taken by Saim Ayub at mid-off. It was nicely bowled by Noman, who sensed Smith was coming and tossed the ball right up. 60th over: England 256-8 (Smith 20, Leach 0) We see batters bowled behind their legs all the time, but rarely between them. Leach plays and misses at his first two balls. The ball is starting to bite again and, difficult as it is, Jamie Smith surely has to go into Qiana Joseph mode now. Potts is bowled between his legs! He got in a bit of a tangle, playing back when he should have been forward, and the ball turned sharply to go between his legs and into the stumps. Sajid has six and England are in all sorts. 59th over: England 252-7 (Smith 20, Potts 2) A lot rests on Jamie Smith here now. Does he go into T20 mode now, or play normally while Potts \u2013 who is a decent batter \u2013 is at the crease? For now he\u2019s content to work Noman off the pads for a single; then Potts hacks a drive past leg stump for another. 58th over: England 250-7 (Smith 19, Potts 1) Sajid celebrated his five-for by getting on all fours to kiss the pitch. He has an eight-for in Tests, against Bangladesh in Mirpur, but this is his first five-for on home soil. \u201cOn behalf of the 66 musicians associated with The Fall I would like to record our collective displeasure about being referenced in your apology to the Pakistan Men\u2019s National Selection Committee,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cWe are a tight knit collective that does not deserve such association. \u201cIn the words of the late great Mark E. Smith: \u2018If it\u2019s me and your granny on bongos, it\u2019s The Fall\u2019.\u201d If you see your granny, thank her for this. Five wickets for Sajid Khan! Carse comes down the track to play an extravagant flamingo shot, but he doesn\u2019t get enough on it and Saud Shakeel takes the catch at long on. 57th over: England 248-6 (Smith 18, Carse 4) Still no big turn, no big shots either. Smith and Carse are proceeding with caution, which is understandable after the mayhem they experienced last night. \u201cSajid is great isn\u2019t he?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cExactly the attitude Pakistan needs. Rizwan also looks like he\u2019s enjoying himself. I know it\u2019s only vibes, but vibes matter.\u201d They sure do. Totally agree about Sajid\u2019s personality; he has such expressive eyes too. I\u2019m surprised his record is so modest as he looks a pretty good bowler who puts a lot on the ball. 56th over: England 246-6 (Smith 17, Carse 3) Carse is not out As you were, outside the line. Not even umpire\u2019s call. Hang on, this is closer than I realised. I think it hit him on the backside, rather than the front pad, so this could well be out. Pakistan review for LBW against Carse Smith misses a sweep off Sajid, who goes up for LBW. Outside the line. Carse does likewise later in the over and again the umpire says not out. Pakistan are reviewing it but, although it was closer than the Smith appeal, it looked outside the line. 55th over: England 244-6 (Smith 16, Carse 3) Noman Ali starts with a maiden to Jamie Smith. England will be encouraged that there has been no extravagant turn in the first couple of overs. 54th over: England 244-6 (Smith 16, Carse 3) Brydon Carse is dropped! It was an extremely tough chance to the bowler Sajid, who threw his hands up in self-preservation when Carse smashed the ball back at him. All he could do was push it over his shoulder. Smith works the ball around more serenely to score four of England\u2019s five runs in the over. Sajid Khan is going to open the bowling. England will hope the heavy roller dulls the pitch for an hour or two, which would allow them to get somewhere near Pakistan\u2019s first-innings score. The players are ready to go. Big first hour coming up! The state of play England will resume on 239 for 6, still 127 runs behind, after losing four wickets in an exhilarating final hour that changed the mood of the whole series. That\u2019s a big deficit on an crumbling pitch, especially as England have to bat last, so the morning session could be pivotal. It feels like England need to get to within 50 of Pakistan to have a realistic chance of victory. Between 13 and 16 October 2024, The Guardian published a series of articles which made erroneous observations about the group selecting the Pakistan men\u2019s cricket team: That in the last four years the selection committee has had more members than The Fall. That their pivot from a pace-dominated bowling attack to picking seven spinners was less a volte face, more a volte farce. That replacing Pakistan\u2019s best player with an uncapped 29-year-old was the essence of madness. That you could leave them alone in a brewery for 48 hours and they would emerge sober, whistling Happy Go Lucky Me. That they are unable to distinguish between their elbow and their hindquarters. This was a collective failure of process and we apologise for any offence caused.",

A Danish blogger and publisher, he runs the research arm of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/revealed-international-race-science-network-secretly-funded-by-us-tech-boss\">secretive network called the Human Diversity Foundation</a>.</p> \n<p>Kirkegaard is a named author on more than 40 papers published in the journal Mankind Quarterly, a longstanding outlet for race science theories. The topics of Kirkegaard\u2019s inquiries have included whether black Americans earn less than white Americans because of \u201caverage intelligence differences\u201d, comparing <a href=\"https://mankindquarterly.org/archive/issue/63-4/7\">penis size</a>, testicle size and \u201cbreast-buttock preference\u201d by race, and an attempt to show that in Denmark those with \u201cMuslim names\u201d have lower IQs.</p> \n<p>The geneticist Adam Rutherford told the Guardian that Mankind Quarterly and similar periodicals were so discredited that it would be \u201ccareer suicide\u201d for a genuine academic to publish in them.

He added: \u201cThey are not bona fide researchers.\u201d But he said the undercover footage \u201cdoes not raise questions about UK Biobank\u2019s controls\u201d, so \u201cthere appears to be no UK Biobank data misuse relating to this organisation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Rory Collins, the head of UK Biobank, said: \u201cWe are confident that our access procedures are working, but sadly we operate in a world where unethical people will seek to undermine this.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe have robust data access processes that control who can access raw data.\u201d He said \u201cour extensive investigations\u201d have not \u201cfound any evidence of these data being available to unapproved researchers\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe most likely conclusion that we can draw from the evidence presented by the Guardian is that these individuals are using publicly-available summary data to conduct their abhorrent research.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, two eminent geneticists questioned UK Biobank\u2019s position, as did two health data experts. They pointed to terms the race science researchers used suggesting they had obtained individual participant data with names stripped out. The UK Biobank representative accepted that there was \u201ca possibility\u201d that the race science researchers had \u201cobtained raw, individual-level data\u201d.</p> \n<h2>\u2018You\u2019re not meant to have that\u2019</h2> \n<p>It was over smoked salmon and venison at a chic Notting Hill restaurant that the head of the Human Diversity Foundation\u2019s media arm revealed the group had obtained UK Biobank data. Matthew Frost, a former religious studies teacher at a London private school, has told the Guardian he is no longer affiliated with the network.</p> \n<p>But at the October 2023 dinner, he spoke of his ambitions for the organisation. Unaware of the camera hidden in the shirt button of the man sitting opposite, he said the team of researchers he was helping to raise money for had \u201cbig-ticket items\u201d planned.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve managed to get access to the UK Biobank,\u201d Frost said. \u201cYou\u2019re not meant to have that.\u201d To know more, Frost said, \u201ctalk to Emil\u201d.</p> \n<p>Kirkegaard maintains that his <a href=\"https://x.com/KirkegaardEmil/status/1026068789581045760\">politics</a> are not \u201cfar right\u201d but \u201cheterodox\u201d. His work, however, promotes racist ideas.</p> \n<p>He <a href=\"https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/will-the-real-emil-please-stand-up\">has argued</a> in favour of removing \u201cimmigrants already settled\u201d in countries such as Denmark, writing: \u201cI generally support policies that pay them to leave.\u201d<strong> </strong>An advocate of eugenics, Kirkegaard has <a href=\"https://x.com/KirkegaardEmil/status/1067059021692223489\">written</a> that if technology allowed it, parents would be \u201csilly not to \u2026 select against gayness\u201d.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, Kirkegaard enjoys some influential connections. The recordings show him claiming that in 2019 he was among the \u201conline dissidents\u201d that the tech billionaire and rightwing donor Peter Thiel flew to Silicon Valley for discussions. Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>A few days after the Notting Hill dinner, Frost arranged for the undercover researcher<strong> </strong>to speak with Kirkegaard, who explained why it was so hard to access the most sensitive data.</p> \n<p>\u201cGenetic datasets that you need for testing things with, say, ethnic differences in IQ or anything in that direction are all behind bars,\u201d Kirkegaard said. He went on: \u201cThe only way we get these datasets is when some academic gets them and gives them to us under the table.\u201d He added: \u201cNot necessarily academics, sometimes private sector \u2026 taking a big risk for themselves.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations.contact%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations.contact%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.me%2F%23p%2F%2B447721857348%22%3ESignal%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447721857348%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207721%20857%20348.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

      "bodyText": "Fringe researchers advocating \u201cnefarious\u201d theories that intelligence is based on race have obtained data from a trove of sensitive health information donated by half a million British volunteers, according to undercover footage. Recordings made by the anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate show members of a \u201crace science\u201d network discussing UK Biobank data they claimed to have accessed. Some of the group have been blacklisted by the facility on the grounds they are \u201cnot bona fide\u201d academics, but the footage suggests they may have circumvented its controls. It shows them saying they obtained a \u201clarge\u201d haul of the data. One of their associates acknowledges they are \u201cnot meant to have that\u201d. Founded in 2003 by the Department of Health and medical research charities, UK Biobank holds the genetic information, survey responses, blood samples and medical records of 500,000 volunteers. The information it holds has been used to shed new light on diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease and other illnesses. UK Biobank says projects using its data must be \u201cin the public interest\u201d. Participants give consent for their information to be used, with identifying details removed, for \u201chealth-related research purposes\u201d. Until recently, rather than having to use UK Biobank\u2019s own platform, approved researchers were free to download datasets on to their own systems. Researchers sign a contract undertaking not to share data without authorisation. The footage raises questions about whether the controls have been sufficient. \u201cThis shocking news suggests an appalling failure of governance at multiple levels,\u201d said Katie Bramall-Stainer, who, as the representative of GPs in the British Medical Association doctors\u2019 union, wants tighter controls on health data. \u201cQuestions now need to be answered by UK Biobank and NHS England around how, when, where, why, with whom, and for what purpose, confidential data was shared.\u201d The undercover footage has been examined by the Guardian, which conducted further research alongside Hope Not Hate. The group of race science researchers, which claims to have obtained UK Biobank data, is led by Emil Kirkegaard. A Danish blogger and publisher, he runs the research arm of a secretive network called the Human Diversity Foundation. Kirkegaard is a named author on more than 40 papers published in the journal Mankind Quarterly, a longstanding outlet for race science theories. The topics of Kirkegaard\u2019s inquiries have included whether black Americans earn less than white Americans because of \u201caverage intelligence differences\u201d, comparing penis size, testicle size and \u201cbreast-buttock preference\u201d by race, and an attempt to show that in Denmark those with \u201cMuslim names\u201d have lower IQs. The geneticist Adam Rutherford told the Guardian that Mankind Quarterly and similar periodicals were so discredited that it would be \u201ccareer suicide\u201d for a genuine academic to publish in them. Kirkegaard\u2019s positions appear closer to racism than science. \u201cAfricans,\u201d Kirkegaard wrote on his blog in July, \u201care prone to violence everywhere.\u201d Often referred to as \u201cscientific racism\u201d, race science emerged from 18th-century breakthroughs in medicine and biology, including Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection. It is dismissed as pseudoscience by the National Institutes of Health, the main US medical research agency, which says race science \u201cappropriates the methods and legitimacy of science to argue for the superiority of white Europeans and the inferiority of non-white people whose social and economic status have been historically marginalised\u201d. David Curtis, a genetics professor at University College London, said \u201cunsophisticated analysis\u201d of genetic data \u201ccould be used to support a racist claim\u201d by \u201cselectively reporting the findings\u201d. A UK Biobank representative said it \u201chas continued to monitor and prevent attempts to access the resource by Kirkegaard and other researchers believed to be connected with him\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are not bona fide researchers.\u201d But he said the undercover footage \u201cdoes not raise questions about UK Biobank\u2019s controls\u201d, so \u201cthere appears to be no UK Biobank data misuse relating to this organisation.\u201d Prof Rory Collins, the head of UK Biobank, said: \u201cWe are confident that our access procedures are working, but sadly we operate in a world where unethical people will seek to undermine this.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have robust data access processes that control who can access raw data.\u201d He said \u201cour extensive investigations\u201d have not \u201cfound any evidence of these data being available to unapproved researchers\u201d. \u201cThe most likely conclusion that we can draw from the evidence presented by the Guardian is that these individuals are using publicly-available summary data to conduct their abhorrent research.\u201d However, two eminent geneticists questioned UK Biobank\u2019s position, as did two health data experts.

The foreign secretary is expected to arrive in Beijing on Friday for high-level meetings before travelling to Shanghai on Saturday. The trip marks a shift in the British government\u2019s approach to China, with ministers seeking to improve engagement and build closer economic ties. Trade between the UK and China is worth \u00a3110bn a year. Senior government figures are bullish about their approach, pointing out that allies including the US and the EU have maintained high-level engagement with China in recent years while the UK has fallen behind. As part of this diplomatic rapprochement, Labour has dropped its tough stance towards Beijing over its treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority. China has detained Uyghurs at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where for years there have been allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse. The Chinese government claims the camps carry out \u201cre-education\u201d to combat terrorism. The European parliament passed an emergency resolution this week censuring China\u2019s repression of the Uyghurs and calling for the release of detainees. In opposition, Labour backed a Commons motion that declared China\u2019s conduct genocide and urged the government to seek formal recognition of this through the UN and with other countries. Stephen Kinnock, then shadow Asia minister, said in 2021 that it was not enough to leave the matter to international courts because China would have to consent to an investigation. \u201cIdeally, a competent international court would examine this evidence, but there is no prospect that either the ICC or the international court of justice will be able to do so, as this would require the consent of China,\u201d Kinnock told the Commons. \u201cThe foreign secretary should seek to introduce a general assembly resolution requesting an advisory opinion from the international court of justice on the question of genocide. We should also explore legal avenues via other international treaties and conventions.\u201d Lammy confirmed this was still his position at a Fabian Society event in 2023 and said a Labour government would \u201cact multilaterally with our partners\u201d to pursue legal routes towards declaring China\u2019s actions genocide. But a government source told the Guardian that \u201cgenocide is a determination for competent international courts to decide\u201d. A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \u201cThis government stands firm on human rights, including in Xinjiang, where China continues to persecute and arbitrarily detain Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities. This includes raising our concerns at the highest levels of the Chinese government and coordinating efforts with our international partners to hold China to account for human rights violations.\u201d Lammy\u2019s two-day visit to China was confirmed by the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Thursday. A UK business source briefed on the visit said Labour was pursuing the same strategy as Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson, but more successfully. \u201cAll the signs are that they are taking the engagement side of the relationship much much more positively and seriously than the previous government,\u201d they said. \u201cThey seem to be pretty robust about being sensible that engagement doesn\u2019t mean agreement.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing from our perspective is recognition of the importance to the UK growth agenda of a sensible trade and investment with China.\u201d Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is drawing up plans to visit the country early next year and restart two high-level economic forums, the Economic and Financial Dialogue and the Joint Economic and Trade Commission.

Labour is likely to find internal party management easier on this issue, although it is still likely to come under pressure over China\u2019s actions in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Xinjiang. Lammy met his counterpart, Wang Yi, in July in Laos, where the foreign secretary raised human rights, Ukraine and parliamentarians under sanctions. Rahima Mahmut, the UK director of the World Uyghur Congress, said: \u201cIn opposition, Labour accurately described the suffering of my people as genocide.

Local television in Houthi-run areas of the country reported 15 strikes hit five sites near the capital, Sana\u2019a, and in the northern governorate Saada, the traditional Houthi homeland, on Thursday around dawn. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said in a statement: \u201cUS forces targeted several of the Houthis\u2019 underground facilities housing various weapons components of types that the Houthis have used to target civilian and military vessels throughout the region.\u201d The strikes were aimed at degrading the Houthis\u2019 military capabilities to \u201cdefend US forces and personnel in one of the world\u2019s most critical waterways,\u201d he said. In what was widely viewed as a message to Iran amid fears of a regional conflagration, Austin added that use of the long-range stealth bomber demonstrated \u201cUS global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere\u201d. There were no immediate reports of casualties. \u201cAmerica will pay the price for its aggression on Yemen, and as we have said before, its aggression will not deter Yemen from its stance in support of Gaza,\u201d Nasruddin Amer, the deputy head of the media office for the Houthis, said on X. The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah, is a fundamentalist Shia group allied with Iran and forms part of Tehran\u2019s region-wide \u201caxis of resistance\u201d against Israel and the US. The region is still on high alert for Israeli retaliation to an Iranian barrage of 180 ballistic missiles fired towards the Jewish state earlier this month. For nearly a year, the group has targeted ships travelling through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea that it says are linked to Israel, in what it has described as a show of solidarity with Palestinians in the war in Gaza.

Companies often claim that toxic chemicals\u2019 health and safety data, and even their names, are \u201cconfidential business information\u201d (CBI) because making the data public could damage their bottom line. The US Environmental Protection Agency frequently allows industry to use the tactic, which makes it virtually impossible for public health researchers to quickly learn about dangerous chemicals.

      "body": "  <h2>XVIII. Caesar and Cleopatra (1945)</h2> <p>In this heavy-going British Technicolor adaptation of George Bernard Shaw\u2019s play, Claude Rains\u2019s oddly relaxed Julius Caesar plays father figure to Vivien Leigh\u2019s implausibly girlish Cleopatra, schooling her in the art of power with just a hint of May to December flirtation. The two leads are just about charismatic enough to compel interest despite Shaw\u2019s ponderous dialogue.</p>    <h2>XVII. A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966)</h2> <p>Stephen Sondheim\u2019s hit Broadway show based on the comedies of Plautus gets a big-screen transfer boasting the talents of Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, Michael Hordern, the young Michael Crawford \u2013 and Buster Keaton in his last film. It should be a riot, but it misfires: director Richard Lester drives the farce so hard it\u2019s almost impossible to follow and inexplicably uses just five of Sondheim\u2019s songs.</p>    <h2>XVI. The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964)</h2> <p>This lugubrious box-office bomb, which killed off the Roman epic for decades, charts the transition from poisoned philosopher emperor Marcus Aurelius \u2013 Alec Guinness, phoning in the gravitas \u2013 to wayward son Commodus. Marches, processions and battles win out over narrative coherence, Sophia Loren and Stephen Boyd bring glamour without chemistry, while Christopher Plummer\u2019s startling performance as the increasingly deranged Commodus gets lost in the mix.</p>    <h2>XV. Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra (2002)</h2> <p>The best of the five Asterix &amp; Obelix live-action films (OK, not a high bar) sees the two moustachioed Gauls (played by Christian Clavier and G\u00e9rard Depardieu) help architect Edifis (Jamel Debbouze) build a palace for Cleopatra (Monica Bellucci). It\u2019s amusing enough, but would doubtless be funnier if you can understand the wordplay in the original French. The only film here with a bespoke Snoop Dogg track over the end credits.</p>    <h2>XIV. Sebastiane (1976)</h2> <p>Derek Jarman\u2019s first feature (co-directed with Paul Humfress) follows Sebastian, former favourite of the emperor Diocletian and a devout Christian, on his exile to a military outpost seething with sexual tensions. A low-budget landmark of queer cinema, it also wins laurels for authenticity, being scripted entirely in Latin (the title is in the vocative case, in case you were wondering).</p>    <h2>XIII. The Eagle (2011)</h2> <p>Roman officer Marcus (Channing Tatum) and British slave Esca (Jamie Bell) head north of Hadrian\u2019s Wall to find the golden standard that was lost when Marcus\u2019s father\u2019s legion went missing 20 years earlier. All that stands in their way is a formidable tribe of Gaelic-speaking, blue-faced \u201cSeal People\u201d. Kevin Macdonald directs this somewhat predictable Romano-British western with a sure touch.</p> <h2>XII. Carry On Cleo (1964)</h2>    <p>Everyone knows the \u201cInfamy! Infamy!\u201d line, but there\u2019s a deeper reason why this outing of the Carry On franchise \u2013 filmed on sets originally made for Cleopatra \u2013 is probably the most fondly remembered: the cast, led by Kenneth Williams as a hapless, henpecked Caesar, are all fizzing at the top of their game, making it churlish to quibble about the uneven gag quality and a plot as flimsy as Amanda Barrie\u2019s costumes.</p>    <h2>XI. Julius Caesar (1953)</h2> <p>Roman and biblical films took off in the 1950s as colour spectaculars with huge sets, but this black-and-white Shakespeare adaptation from MGM keeps it relatively simple, majoring on its superb cast: a red-hot Marlon Brando as Mark Antony, James Mason on strong form as Brutus, and a particularly lean and hungry John Gielgud as Cassius. Joseph L Mankiewicz directs, a decade before he took on Cleopatra.</p>    <h2>X. Fellini Satyricon (1969)</h2> <p>Federico Fellini\u2019s loose interpretation of Petronius\u2019s Satyricon \u2013 a picaresque novel that survives only in fragments \u2013 is disjointed and bewildering, a visually astounding fever dream of ancient Rome. A film more to be admired than enjoyed, it reaches back across two millennia to present lurid, arresting snapshots of a strange pagan culture.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts0N8swyWFI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ts0N8swyWFI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Gladiator II trailer \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>IX. Cleopatra (1934)</h2> <p>Claudette Colbert is kittenish and steely in Cecil B DeMille\u2019s brisk run-through of the Cleopatra legend, from arrival by carpet to death by asp. Released just after Hollywood self-censorship came into force, the film still has a pre-Hays Code feel to it: the skimpy outfits, the on-barge party that breaks out after Cleopatra\u2019s seduction of Mark Antony, and the sense that no one is taking it that seriously.</p>    <h2>VIII. Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian (1979)</h2> <p>Among its many virtues, Life of Brian is a splendid parody of a Roman epic, from Terry Gilliam\u2019s bombastic opening titles to the unheroic chorus of \u201cI\u2019m Brian!\u201d spoofing Spartacus. And you don\u2019t have to have studied Latin to enjoy the names \u2013 Biggus Dickus, Incontinentia Buttocks \u2013 or the \u201cRomanes eunt domus\u201d grammar lesson.</p>    <h2>VII. The Sign of the Cross (1932)</h2> <p>Claudette Colbert bathing in donkey milk, an attempted lesbian seduction dance, a gorilla approaching a semi-naked woman tied to a post \u2026 it\u2019s all there in Cecil B DeMille\u2019s scandalous pre-Code romp about the crackdown ordered by Nero (the wonderful Charles Laughton) after the fire of Rome. Marcus Superbus (Fredric March) should be rounding up Christians but falls for one of them instead.</p>    <h2>VI. Quo Vadis (1951)</h2> <p>Launching the postwar boom in Roman epics, director Mervyn LeRoy serves up a full-colour, cast-of-thousands spectacle made at Cinecitt\u00e0 studios. The plot is similar to The Sign of the Cross: Robert Taylor\u2019s army officer is wooing Deborah Kerr\u2019s clandestine Christian, while Nero (Peter Ustinov) warbles and dreams of burning Rome. There is memorable support from Patricia Laffan, exuding lizard-eyed menace as Nero\u2019s wife Poppaea, and Leo Genn as the world-weary Petronius.</p>    <h2>V. Caligula: the Ultimate Cut (2023)</h2> <p>Decried as a \u201cmoral holocaust\u201d on its original release in 1979, Caligula emerges as a compelling portrait of unfettered power in this revelatory new cut, endorsed by star Malcolm McDowell. Stripped of the porn spliced in by producer Bob Guccione, but still bursting with nudity, depravity and gruesome violence, it now makes far more sense and allows extra screen time for Helen Mirren as the emperor\u2019s wife, Caesonia. McDowell gives an electrifying performance to complete an unholy trinity with his roles in If \u2026 and A Clockwork Orange, while Peter O\u2019Toole is convincingly repellent as the degenerate Tiberius. Influenced by Fellini Satyricon \u2013 designer Danilo Donati worked on both films \u2013 this disturbing film dares to show aspects of ancient Rome untouched by the classic-era epics.</p>    <h2>IV. Cleopatra (1963)</h2> <p>Monumentally expensive and beset with production problems, this four-hour marathon became a symbol of epic bloat while entering legend for bringing Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton together. But viewed today with the benefit of a pause button, it\u2019s a superbly enjoyable spectacle with intelligent dialogue that has plenty to say about the 18 momentous years of ancient history it covers. Rex Harrison\u2019s thoughtful portrayal of Julius Caesar dominates the first half, while the second traces the sad descent of Mark Antony (Burton) into self-destructive passion and self-pity as he loses his power struggle with Octavian (Roddy McDowall). As Cleopatra, Taylor radiates megawatt star power throughout, right to the stunning final shot of her dead body laid out in gold.</p>    <h2>III. Ben-Hur (1959)</h2> <p>The colossus that marked the apogee of epic \u2013 shot in widescreen and unfolding over three and a half hours \u2013 and won a record 11 Oscars (since matched but not beaten). To modern eyes, the overlap with the story of Jesus gets in the way of what should be the film\u2019s essential storyline: the broken friendship and subsequent animosity between the Jewish patriot Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) and ruthlessly ambitious Roman commander Messala (Stephen Boyd), which comes to a head in the still-stunning chariot race. Haya Harareet as Judah\u2019s beloved Esther and Jack Hawkins as the consul Arrius (\u201cBattle speed \u2026 attack speed \u2026 ramming speed!\u201d) offer terrific support. The gargantuan scale is really the point of it all \u2013 sit back and enjoy those grand sets and the ravishing Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa score.</p>    <h2>II. Gladiator (2000)</h2> <p>Taking the basic scenario of The Fall of the Roman Empire and adding ingredients from other classics (the great man reduced to slavery from Ben-Hur; the fight school sequences of Spartacus; the arena scenes from Quo Vadis), director Ridley Scott resuscitated the long-dead Roman epic with this powerfully straightforward tale of betrayal and revenge. Russell Crowe is career-definingly immense as Maximus, fighting his way towards Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s deliciously creepy Emperor Commodus. An excellent supporting cast \u2013 including Oliver Reed, who died during the shoot \u2013 adds to the film\u2019s lustre. It may not have had much new to say about the grandeur that was Rome, but were we not entertained?</p>    <h2>I. Spartacus (1960)</h2> <p>After failing to land the lead in Ben-Hur, Kirk Douglas became the star-producer of his own Roman epic, hiring the young Stanley Kubrick to direct. It\u2019s not quite a masterpiece: Douglas is a little one-note as the eponymous leader of a slave revolt that is both underexplained and sentimentalised. But unlike many epics, the film proceeds with a sense of purpose, is packed with memorable scenes, and deserves credit for breaking free of the Christian sermonising that had marked Roman films of the 1950s. Nor does the thinly veiled modern political subtext in Dalton Trumbo\u2019s script detract from this earnest portrait of a significant episode in Roman history. Laurence Olivier is magnificent as the brutal, haunted Crassus and Charles Laughton even better as his wily senatorial rival, Gracchus; Peter Ustinov picked up an Oscar for his turn as the slippery slave master, Batiatus.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Gladiator II is in cinemas from 15 November</em></p>",

And you don\u2019t have to have studied Latin to enjoy the names \u2013 Biggus Dickus, Incontinentia Buttocks \u2013 or the \u201cRomanes eunt domus\u201d grammar lesson. VII. The Sign of the Cross (1932) Claudette Colbert bathing in donkey milk, an attempted lesbian seduction dance, a gorilla approaching a semi-naked woman tied to a post \u2026 it\u2019s all there in Cecil B DeMille\u2019s scandalous pre-Code romp about the crackdown ordered by Nero (the wonderful Charles Laughton) after the fire of Rome. Marcus Superbus (Fredric March) should be rounding up Christians but falls for one of them instead. VI. Quo Vadis (1951) Launching the postwar boom in Roman epics, director Mervyn LeRoy serves up a full-colour, cast-of-thousands spectacle made at Cinecitt\u00e0 studios. The plot is similar to The Sign of the Cross: Robert Taylor\u2019s army officer is wooing Deborah Kerr\u2019s clandestine Christian, while Nero (Peter Ustinov) warbles and dreams of burning Rome. There is memorable support from Patricia Laffan, exuding lizard-eyed menace as Nero\u2019s wife Poppaea, and Leo Genn as the world-weary Petronius. V. Caligula: the Ultimate Cut (2023) Decried as a \u201cmoral holocaust\u201d on its original release in 1979, Caligula emerges as a compelling portrait of unfettered power in this revelatory new cut, endorsed by star Malcolm McDowell. Stripped of the porn spliced in by producer Bob Guccione, but still bursting with nudity, depravity and gruesome violence, it now makes far more sense and allows extra screen time for Helen Mirren as the emperor\u2019s wife, Caesonia. McDowell gives an electrifying performance to complete an unholy trinity with his roles in If \u2026 and A Clockwork Orange, while Peter O\u2019Toole is convincingly repellent as the degenerate Tiberius. Influenced by Fellini Satyricon \u2013 designer Danilo Donati worked on both films \u2013 this disturbing film dares to show aspects of ancient Rome untouched by the classic-era epics. IV. Cleopatra (1963) Monumentally expensive and beset with production problems, this four-hour marathon became a symbol of epic bloat while entering legend for bringing Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton together. But viewed today with the benefit of a pause button, it\u2019s a superbly enjoyable spectacle with intelligent dialogue that has plenty to say about the 18 momentous years of ancient history it covers. Rex Harrison\u2019s thoughtful portrayal of Julius Caesar dominates the first half, while the second traces the sad descent of Mark Antony (Burton) into self-destructive passion and self-pity as he loses his power struggle with Octavian (Roddy McDowall). As Cleopatra, Taylor radiates megawatt star power throughout, right to the stunning final shot of her dead body laid out in gold. III. Ben-Hur (1959) The colossus that marked the apogee of epic \u2013 shot in widescreen and unfolding over three and a half hours \u2013 and won a record 11 Oscars (since matched but not beaten). To modern eyes, the overlap with the story of Jesus gets in the way of what should be the film\u2019s essential storyline: the broken friendship and subsequent animosity between the Jewish patriot Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) and ruthlessly ambitious Roman commander Messala (Stephen Boyd), which comes to a head in the still-stunning chariot race. Haya Harareet as Judah\u2019s beloved Esther and Jack Hawkins as the consul Arrius (\u201cBattle speed \u2026 attack speed \u2026 ramming speed!\u201d) offer terrific support. The gargantuan scale is really the point of it all \u2013 sit back and enjoy those grand sets and the ravishing Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa score. II. Gladiator (2000) Taking the basic scenario of The Fall of the Roman Empire and adding ingredients from other classics (the great man reduced to slavery from Ben-Hur; the fight school sequences of Spartacus; the arena scenes from Quo Vadis), director Ridley Scott resuscitated the long-dead Roman epic with this powerfully straightforward tale of betrayal and revenge. Russell Crowe is career-definingly immense as Maximus, fighting his way towards Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s deliciously creepy Emperor Commodus. An excellent supporting cast \u2013 including Oliver Reed, who died during the shoot \u2013 adds to the film\u2019s lustre. It may not have had much new to say about the grandeur that was Rome, but were we not entertained? I. Spartacus (1960) After failing to land the lead in Ben-Hur, Kirk Douglas became the star-producer of his own Roman epic, hiring the young Stanley Kubrick to direct. It\u2019s not quite a masterpiece: Douglas is a little one-note as the eponymous leader of a slave revolt that is both underexplained and sentimentalised. But unlike many epics, the film proceeds with a sense of purpose, is packed with memorable scenes, and deserves credit for breaking free of the Christian sermonising that had marked Roman films of the 1950s. Nor does the thinly veiled modern political subtext in Dalton Trumbo\u2019s script detract from this earnest portrait of a significant episode in Roman history. Laurence Olivier is magnificent as the brutal, haunted Crassus and Charles Laughton even better as his wily senatorial rival, Gracchus; Peter Ustinov picked up an Oscar for his turn as the slippery slave master, Batiatus. \u2022 Gladiator II is in cinemas from 15 November",

      "body": "<p>In a world where artists are often cautioned to stay in their lane \u2013 to maintain a recognisable brand so you don\u2019t get lost in a crowded, confusing market \u2013 there\u2019s something impressive about Kelly Lee Owens. For the last seven years, her career has constituted a series of handbrake turns, fuelled by a disinclination to make the same record twice. Her debut album situated her at the nexus of ambient techno, shoegazing\u2019s dreamy textures and the warm lo-fi fuzz of bedroom pop: for all its reliance on electronics, it was possible to detect that Owens had previously spent time as the bassist in an indie band, the History of Apple Pie. Inner Song, from 2020, was both more straightforwardly melodic and \u2013 with its four-to-the-floor beats \u2013 more dancefloor-focused; 2022\u2019s LP.8 offered dark-hued ambience punctuated by punishingly distorted rhythms and almost nothing in the way of hooks: Owens spent more time incanting spoken word than she did singing.</p>    <p>After its release, Owens found herself supporting Depeche Mode on tour around the kind of immense US venues the band have been filling since time immemorial. Previously an alumnus of left-field Norwegian label Smalltown Supersound, she signed a new record deal, with dh2, a new electronic wing of Dirty Hit, helmed by George Daniel of the 1975. She also entered the orbit of Daniel\u2019s fiancee, Charli xcx, appearing at her Partygirl event in Ibiza at the start of the summer.</p> <p>An arena tour, a high-profile label, a co-sign from 2024\u2019s defining pop star: it\u2019s tempting to wonder how much that sequence of events influenced Owens\u2019s fourth album. True to form, Dreamstate sounds almost nothing like its predecessor. It may also be Owens\u2019 most ambitious album in so far as it simultaneously attempts to function as mainstream pop music \u2013 centred on her vocals, which appear on virtually every track, albeit occasionally in wordless, sampled form \u2013 as well as to provide a beat-focused, small-hours club soundtrack and to work as a complete home-listening experience. She has always attracted an impressive array of collaborators, from Daniel Avery, who first encouraged her into the studio, to John Cale and actor Michael Sheen, who respectively sang on and starred in the video for her 2020 single Corner of My Eye. This time, it feels telling that the guest list includes Tom Rowlands, who succeeded in straddling the aforementioned boundaries in the 90s as one half of the Chemical Brothers \u2013 there\u2019s something of the duo\u2019s trademark disorientating psychedelic shimmer about his co-production Ballad (in the End) \u2013 and Bicep, who achieved something similar just as Owens\u2019 career was getting under way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EpmtYUfphI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_EpmtYUfphI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Kelly Lee Owens: Love You Got \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Initially at least, you worry that a desire to communicate to a broader audience has led Owens to smooth out the idiosyncrasies that made her previous albums so effective: opener Dark Angel and Sunshine feel not unlike a more tasteful, Instagram-filter take on the big, hollow sound of late 90s Gatecrasher trance. But as Dreamstate progresses, it becomes apparent that Owens is just deploying her idiosyncrasies more subtly than before. The results feel pop-facing without resorting to pop-dance cliches.

      "bodyText": "In a world where artists are often cautioned to stay in their lane \u2013 to maintain a recognisable brand so you don\u2019t get lost in a crowded, confusing market \u2013 there\u2019s something impressive about Kelly Lee Owens. For the last seven years, her career has constituted a series of handbrake turns, fuelled by a disinclination to make the same record twice. Her debut album situated her at the nexus of ambient techno, shoegazing\u2019s dreamy textures and the warm lo-fi fuzz of bedroom pop: for all its reliance on electronics, it was possible to detect that Owens had previously spent time as the bassist in an indie band, the History of Apple Pie. Inner Song, from 2020, was both more straightforwardly melodic and \u2013 with its four-to-the-floor beats \u2013 more dancefloor-focused; 2022\u2019s LP.8 offered dark-hued ambience punctuated by punishingly distorted rhythms and almost nothing in the way of hooks: Owens spent more time incanting spoken word than she did singing. After its release, Owens found herself supporting Depeche Mode on tour around the kind of immense US venues the band have been filling since time immemorial. Previously an alumnus of left-field Norwegian label Smalltown Supersound, she signed a new record deal, with dh2, a new electronic wing of Dirty Hit, helmed by George Daniel of the 1975. She also entered the orbit of Daniel\u2019s fiancee, Charli xcx, appearing at her Partygirl event in Ibiza at the start of the summer. An arena tour, a high-profile label, a co-sign from 2024\u2019s defining pop star: it\u2019s tempting to wonder how much that sequence of events influenced Owens\u2019s fourth album. True to form, Dreamstate sounds almost nothing like its predecessor. It may also be Owens\u2019 most ambitious album in so far as it simultaneously attempts to function as mainstream pop music \u2013 centred on her vocals, which appear on virtually every track, albeit occasionally in wordless, sampled form \u2013 as well as to provide a beat-focused, small-hours club soundtrack and to work as a complete home-listening experience. She has always attracted an impressive array of collaborators, from Daniel Avery, who first encouraged her into the studio, to John Cale and actor Michael Sheen, who respectively sang on and starred in the video for her 2020 single Corner of My Eye. This time, it feels telling that the guest list includes Tom Rowlands, who succeeded in straddling the aforementioned boundaries in the 90s as one half of the Chemical Brothers \u2013 there\u2019s something of the duo\u2019s trademark disorientating psychedelic shimmer about his co-production Ballad (in the End) \u2013 and Bicep, who achieved something similar just as Owens\u2019 career was getting under way. Initially at least, you worry that a desire to communicate to a broader audience has led Owens to smooth out the idiosyncrasies that made her previous albums so effective: opener Dark Angel and Sunshine feel not unlike a more tasteful, Instagram-filter take on the big, hollow sound of late 90s Gatecrasher trance. But as Dreamstate progresses, it becomes apparent that Owens is just deploying her idiosyncrasies more subtly than before. The results feel pop-facing without resorting to pop-dance cliches. Rather than stick a standard song structure over club-friendly beats, its tracks take a more holistic and involving route, fixing on hypnotic, endlessly repeated single vocal lines, allowing the music to build and shift around them, relying on chord changes and melodic instrumental hooks instead of big choruses. There\u2019s an argument that the lyrics she\u2019s singing aren\u2019t up to much. The problem with the ineffable state of dancefloor transcendence as a topic is that it\u2019s ineffable, and Dreamscape\u2019s attempts to capture it feel well-worn: \u201chigher and higher I go\u201d; \u201cwanting pure euphoria\u201d. But the words Owens is singing matter less than their absorbing repetition, which transforms them into part of a succession of enveloping soundscapes. The title track\u2019s mid-tempo chug gradually becomes more and more acidic, while Rise\u2019s evocation of daylight hitting your face as you leave a club is really well done: the insistent pulse of its beat is relegated to somewhere in the distance, as if taking place behind closed doors, the DJ still playing to the dancefloor you\u2019ve just departed. The album\u2019s second half feels becalmed, sinking into a series of ballads, the tempo winding down until the beats vanish entirely, replaced by strings on closer Trust and Desire.

Either begin at the beginning, with The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, Garner\u2019s first novel, published for children in 1960. It is an adventure in which Colin and Susan arrive in the author\u2019s native Cheshire \u2013 Alderley Edge, to be precise \u2013 and are pulled into the folklore of its landscape, deep below the earth. Stephen Fry has written that it was this book which awoke him to \u201cthe inner life of the earth and the inner life of the imagination\u201d when he read it aged 11. Or, to start from a different direction, choose The Stone Book Quartet. Drawn from the Garner family\u2019s own history, these four slender volumes interlock craft, art and myth in the ground of the Edge.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>If you think his books are \u2018for children\u2019</h2> <p>A brief reminder that some of our greatest works (Maurice Sendak\u2019s Where the Wild Things Are, Ursula K Le Guin\u2019s Earthsea books, Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials) have been published \u201cfor children\u201d. Young readers are the best readers. Try the subtlety of Red Shift (1973), its setting moving between three different historical periods and its momentum drawn from the ancient ballad Tam Lin. Or there\u2019s Elidor (1965), much of which is set in urban Manchester. Garner was inspired to write the book when he visited the city\u2019s \u201cslum clearances\u201d with photographer Roger Hill; yes, it\u2019s the story of four children on a magical quest, but it\u2019s also an interrogation of how our very real surroundings have the power to transform us.</p> <p>***</p>    <h2>The masterpiece</h2> <p>Treacle Walker, published in 2021 in Garner\u2019s 87th year, finally vaulted him on to the Booker prize shortlist, and deservedly so. It was a relief to see finally Garner granted mainstream success by this slim yet epic tale. Young Joe is a sickly lad (as his creator once was) and wears a patch to correct a lazy eye. Into this life comes Treacle Walker, a rag-and-bone man \u2013 and later, Thin Amren, who rises from an iron age bog. Into this mix Garner throws Dandy-style comic-book characters such as \u201cStonehenge Kit the Ancient Brit\u201d. Garner\u2019s obsession with time is beautifully realised in a tender story that offers joy to the new reader and Garnerphile alike.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The one we never thought we\u2019d see</h2> <p>Alan Garner had long indicated he\u2019d never write a memoir, but then Where Shall We Run To? appeared in 2018. Slender \u2013 as all this author\u2019s books are \u2013 it is a sequence of recollections from his childhood during the second world war. What is so remarkable about these pieces is his ability to stay absolutely present with his young self. There is no retrospective: there is the unimpeded vision of a boy who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Don\u2019t be put off by</h2> <p>Boneland. It is one of the longest-awaited sequels ever: published in 2012, it is the third volume in the trilogy which began with The Weirdstone and The Moon of Gomrath (1963). It is also a book \u201cfor adults\u201d, while those were books \u201cfor children\u201d. Colin is now a grown man, an astrophysicist and a shaman; the book is an interlocking puzzle-box that demands a great deal even for the initiate. \u201cGarner can count on the trust and admiration of many of his readers to see him through it, but my trust and admiration, though great, weren\u2019t always sufficient,\u201d wrote the great Ursula K Le Guin.</p> <p>***</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/28/powsels-and-thrums-by-alan-garner-review-the-magus-speaks\">Powsels and Thrums by Alan Garner review \u2013 the magus speaks </a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The one that will inspire you to write</h2> <p>Powsels and Thrums is Garner\u2019s second collection of essays (though this wonderful book also includes poetry and fiction, too).

This was just one of the sparks that led to this extraordinary novel, which draws on the tale of Blodeuwedd in the Mabinogion.

      "bodyText": "A new Robert Icke drama about the hunt for Raoul Moat, a revival of Sarah Kane\u2019s final play, and a saga about a Chinese request for the return of a stolen artefact from the British Museum are among the standout pieces that have been announced as part of the latest Royal Court season. The theatre\u2019s artistic director, David Byrne, said the season was \u201cinternationalist\u201d with South African (A Good House) and Palestinian writers (A Knock on the Roof) alongside more established British talent, such as Icke. Byrne said: \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the best stuff I\u2019ve seen over the last year and the most urgent bits of writing that need to be heard from our stages right now, things from our recent past to glimpses of what our future could be.\u201d Byrne believes that Icke\u2019s handling of the Moat affair will be one of the most anticipated theatre moments of 2025. It could also be one of the most controversial. There has been a book about the incident (Andrew Hankinson\u2019s You Could Do Something Amazing With Your Life [You Are Raoul Moat]) and a television drama, ITV\u2019s Hunt for Raoul Moat, which aired last year. The search for Moat resulted in one of the largest manhunts in British history, as the bodybuilder and bouncer was pursued across Northumberland. As Moat camped out in woodland after killing one man and shooting two other people, survival expert Ray Mears was asked to help find him. Before the ITV drama was broadcast, the Guardian visited Rothbury, the village where Moat was eventually apprehended and found several people who said the 2010 incident was still \u201ctoo fresh in people\u2019s memory\u201d. Byrne wouldn\u2019t be drawn on whether all the saga\u2019s twists and turns, including an appearance from Paul Gascoigne who appealed for Moat to turn himself in, would be included in Manhunt, which opens in March next year. \u201cIt\u2019s the part of the world where Robert is from, and it is an epic piece of work,\u201d says Byrne. \u201cHe\u2019s going to look at every aspect of that story and it\u2019s a very different piece of work for Robert but he\u2019s used to taking on those big stories and this is the modern version of that.\u201d A Guardian review of Kane\u2019s 4:48 Psychosis said the play, which she wrote shortly before taking her own life in 1999, had \u201cbeen trapped in the shadows\u201d of what happened to her, but Byrne hopes the new production will reposition it. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be incredibly special, that original creative team returning to that show 25 years later in the space that they originally made it, plugs into a really deep theatre magic,\u201d he said. Byrne added that the new staging would hopefully cement it as one of the most \u201cimportant and influential pieces of theatre writing of the last 100 years\u201d. The final performance of the play\u2019s run at the Royal Shakespeare in Stratford-upon-Avon, where it transfers after the Royal Court, will be held at 4.48am in the morning, which is the time that Kane regularly awoke during the final stages of her depressive illness. Joel Tan\u2019s Scenes From a Repatriation tackles the restitution debate surrounding disputed artefacts in museum collections.

      "body": "<p>On an October evening, Tom Frost was zooming down a dark state road on the northern edge of Indiana. The father of two had just finished his shift at a small-town fiberglass factory. Now, he was doing what he loved, riding a Harley-Davidson in his typical get-up: black gloves, leather chaps, no helmet.</p> <p>As Frost revved past the corn fields and thinning birch trees that led to his girlfriend\u2019s house, a green pickup jerked off a side road and into his path.</p> <p>Frost didn\u2019t have time. He hit the truck and flew backwards, leaving his body and small trails of blood on the asphalt, police photos show.</p> <p>First responders loaded Frost, now incapacitated, on to a helicopter and flew him to the area\u2019s biggest hospital, Parkview Health\u2019s Regional Medical Center. The sprawling, near-million-square-foot campus had opened its doors a year earlier, the capital of a rapidly expanding empire of hospitals and doctors offices spreading out from Fort Wayne to the rural counties of the Indiana-Ohio borderlands.</p> <p>Parkview Health\u2019s doctors operated on Frost\u2019s fractured right leg and face. Eventually, he woke up from his coma. But for weeks afterwards, he suffered from significant brain trauma. He called his mother, who spent days sitting beside his hospital bed, \u201cNumber 1\u201d, not \u201cMom\u201d.</p> <p>So about a month after the 2013 crash, when a hospital employee pulled aside his mother and asked her to sign an agreement promising to pay for \u201call\u201d of her son\u2019s charges, the 66-year-old retired bartender signed where she was told.</p> <p>Frost\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know how much the bill was going to be. All she knew was that her son, who was uninsured, needed care.</p> <p>After Frost\u2019s discharge, Parkview Health, a not-for-profit system, sent him a letter outlining how much it wanted: $629,386.50.</p> <p>Frost\u2019s family was willing to pay, according to a subsequent court filing submitted by his attorney. But the bill was bigger than what they thought was reasonable. For example, after his high-level surgeries, Parkview transferred him to a skilled nursing facility, where he worked on his rehab and recovery for 55 days. For that period, the hospital wanted $144,487.73, in effect a daily charge of more than $2,600.</p> <p>An auditor hired by the family\u2019s attorney identified thousands of dollars in billing errors in the hospital\u2019s itemized statement, some of which the hospital later relented on. More significantly, based on federal billing guidelines, the auditor concluded the \u201cfair and reasonable value\u201d of the services Frost received actually amounted to $255,903.45 \u2013 still a hefty sum, but only about 40% of what the hospital was demanding.</p> <p>After a two-year legal battle that threatened to <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/parkview-hospital-ordered-to-disclose-rates-chargemaster-info-in-billing-lawsuit.html\">shed light</a> on Parkview\u2019s closely guarded billing practices, the hospital had Frost sign a confidentiality agreement and settled the case for an undisclosed sum.</p> <p>But the enormous hospital bill Parkview sent to Frost was not an aberration.</p> <p>Over more than a decade, Parkview Health has demanded that the people of north-eastern Indiana and north-western Ohio pay some of the highest prices of any hospital system in the country \u2013 despite being headquartered in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which currently <a href=\"https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/best-affordable-places-to-live-in-the-us#:~:text=&amp;text=Summit%20City%20is%20known%20for,Learn%20more%20about%20Fort%20Wayne\">ranks</a> as the No 1 most affordable metro area to live in the United States.</p> <p>For 10 of the last 13 years, Parkview hospitals on average have been among the top 10% most expensive in the country, a Guardian US analysis of cost estimates based on data submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid shows.</p>    <p>Parkview\u2019s steep prices are the product of a more than two-decade campaign by hospital executives to establish market dominance in Fort Wayne and to squeeze revenue from a pool of patients and employers who feel they have no better alternatives, according to interviews with more than 40 current and former Parkview employees, patients, local business leaders, lawmakers and competitors, as well as leaked audio recordings of meetings and hundreds of internal billing, patient and policy documents obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>During this period, Parkview has taken over six former rival hospitals and built up a network of almost <a href=\"https://www.parkview.com/-/media/parkview-media/file/2023_12-december/12182023-parkview-physicians-group-fact-sheet.ashx\">300 sites</a> for its physicians and providers, forming a ring around its gleaming regional center, which some staff refer to in private as the \u201cBig House\u201d or \u201cEmerald City\u201d for its ritzy amenities and green corporate branding.</p> <p>This consolidation, former employees say, has allowed Parkview to control referral flows, routing primary care patients to their own costly specialists and facilities, even if those patients could get the same services elsewhere for less. It has also increased Parkview\u2019s leverage in <a href=\"https://nashp.org/can-we-please-stop-fixating-on-hospital-chargemasters/\">negotiations</a> with health insurance companies, as they bargain over procedure prices on behalf of employers that offer the insurers\u2019 health plans to their workers.</p> <p>Insurance industry sources say Parkview\u2019s growing web of hospitals makes it hard for any insurer to offer a viable health plan locally without including the chain\u2019s facilities in their network, an advantage that has helped the not-for-profit extract high prices and earn a reputation as one of the toughest negotiators in the state.</p> <p>Not-for-profit healthcare has been good <a href=\"https://businesspeople.com/Post/2064/business-leader-of-the-yea\">business</a> for Parkview as it has been for hundreds of other ostensible charities across the US which operate <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals\">nearly half</a> of the nation\u2019s hospitals. In exchange for generous tax breaks, these institutions are required to provide free and discounted care to poor patients, but many have <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/policies-to-hold-nonprofit-hospitals-accountable/\">faced criticism</a> for skimping on charity care, demanding high prices and giving executives exorbitant salaries.</p> <p>Since 2019, Parkview has raked in more than $2bn in revenue annually, enabling the system to give dozens of its executives and top doctors six- and seven-figure annual compensation packages. Before his retirement at the end of 2022, Parkview\u2019s longtime CEO, an <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mike-packnett-parkview-health/id1561393987?i=1000546771703\">avowed</a> <a href=\"https://www.wane.com/news/drive-in-prayer-service-is-positively-fort-wayne/\">Christian</a> who publicly styled himself as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bizvoicemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AAW-Packnett.pdf\">servant</a>\u201d leader, took home nearly $3m from the not-for-profit, according to the system\u2019s last publicly available IRS disclosure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/parkview-expansion/giv-4559BVca3M9pnOWa\" data-alt=\"Graph of Parkview expansion, showing the extent of the system\u2019s growth.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/parkview-expansion/giv-4559BVca3M9pnOWa\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Parkview declined repeated requests in recent weeks to make its current CEO available for interview and chose not to respond to a series of detailed questions submitted by the Guardian several days ahead of publication.

The system has also <a href=\"https://www.fwbusiness.com/fwbusiness/article_58fceaa5-dee2-56ae-8ce5-955846daa26f.html\">claimed</a> that past studies of its prices have been \u201cfilled with inaccuracies\u201d and \u201cincomplete analyses\u201d.</p> <p>Parkview\u2019s expansion in Fort Wayne, a mid-sized, midwestern city surrounded by miles of corn fields and manufacturing plants, reflects a larger trend of consolidation that has transformed America\u2019s once mostly locally run healthcare system and ratcheted up its costs for more than a generation.</p> <p>Since the 1990s, hospital systems across the US \u2013 for and not-for-profit alike \u2013 have relentlessly chased after market power, executing nearly <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/ten-things-to-know-about-consolidation-in-health-care-provider-markets/\">2,000</a> mergers with little pushback from overwhelmed federal antitrust regulators and indifferent state authorities. Research from the American Medical Association found that by 2013, 97% of healthcare markets in the US had little competition and were highly consolidated under Department of Justice antitrust guidelines. By 2021, that figure had risen to 99%.</p>    <p>With consolidation, academic researchers have <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/0d2c04fec395bc8c573c5b20c189cdd0/enviromental-scan-consolidation-hcm.pdf\">consistently</a> found significant increases in prices. A 2012 research <a href=\"https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/hospitals-monopoly#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20literature%20survey,if%20you%20stay%20in%20a\">survey</a> concluded that when hospitals merge in concentrated markets price hikes were \u201ctypically quite large, most exceeding 20 percent\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7517591/\">A 2019 study</a> found that prices at hospitals enjoying local monopoly power were 12% higher than those in markets with at least four competitors. A <a href=\"https://tobin.yale.edu/research/is-there-too-little-antitrust-enforcement-us-hospital-sector\">study</a> released earlier this year identified dozens of hospital mergers that it said regulators could have flagged as likely to diminish competition and raise prices. Those mergers did, in fact, result in average price hikes of 5% or more, the researchers found.</p> <p>Rising healthcare costs don\u2019t just hurt patients. They also <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2024/06/24/rising-health-care-prices-are-driving-unemployment-and-job-losses\">squeeze</a> local employers, who have to choose between wages, headcount and insurance costs \u2013 decisions that low-wage workers pay for down the line. A <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32613\">working paper</a> from earlier this summer found that every 1% increase in healthcare prices, driven by hospital mergers, lowered both employment and payroll at companies outside the health sector by approximately 0.4% \u2013 trends, which in turn, increased deaths by opioid overdose and suicide.</p> <p>Zack Cooper, a Yale economist and one of the co-authors of that paper, argues that consolidation has its most pernicious effects in areas like north-eastern Indiana and north-western Ohio, where Parkview has established itself as the dominant player: semi-rural parts of the country which already had comparatively few healthcare providers and are even more vulnerable to consolidation and price hikes.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you start to see these 10 to 15% price increases over time,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cOutside of New York, LA, Chicago and Houston, often the hospitals are really the biggest employers in town. They\u2019ve got these beautiful campuses and rolling grass lawns, and you say, \u2018Oh gosh, this is good for the economy.\u2019 But what we\u2019re starting to see is that many of our local health systems are boa constrictors just tightening around and squeezing the life of some of these local economies.\u201d</p> <h2>The not-for-profit cut services. Then a young mother died</h2> <p>Parkview Health is now north-eastern Indiana\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.parkview.com/news/results/09272023-parkview-health-among-top-10-in-indiana-on-forbes-list\">largest employer</a>. And as the hospital system has grown, it has refashioned greater Fort Wayne in its own image.</p> <p>Parkview has built its own police force with <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/12/15/hospital-police-have-power-officers-but-little-oversight/6362900002/#:~:text=Parkview's%20hospitals%20have%2063%20armed,additional%2060%20unarmed%20security%20guards.\">dozens</a> of armed officers stationed across the region. It has stuck its green and gray colors on the jerseys of Fort Wayne\u2019s minor league baseball team, and paid millions to call their downtown stadium, \u201cParkview Field\u201d. Today, even the local hockey rink, \u201cSportOne Parkview Icehouse\u201d, and a local YMCA, \u201cParkview Family YMCA\u201d, pay homage to the not-for-profit.</p>    <p>In Fort Wayne and its surrounding deep-red counties, business leaders and Republican state lawmakers have grumbled for years about Parkview\u2019s high prices \u2013 including several who spoke on the condition of anonymity for this story. But no major establishment figure has been willing to cross the hospital.</p> <p>Last summer, the biggest ever local challenge to the not-for-profit\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL51YvQCeSkiKLSnWZRDTY7d9evmTzKxFj\">carefully</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhrl-My3Y8E\">cultivated</a> reputation came not from elected officials, but a spontaneous coalition of suburban and rural mothers from DeKalb county. The women, calling themselves \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/moms-against-parkview-protest-removal-of-birthing-services-from-dekalb-lagrange-hospitals/\">Moms Against Parkview</a>\u201d, were upset that the healthcare system had decided to shut down the labor and delivery unit at their local formerly independent hospital, which the system had absorbed and rechristened as \u201cParkview DeKalb\u201d in 2019.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.fwbusiness.com/fwbusiness/article_3d0533f3-7990-5832-8f71-aaa88b00d0cf.html\">statement</a> to the media, the prosperous not-for-profit likened itself to <a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/most-rural-hospitals-arent-offering-labor-and-delivery-services-forcing-mothers-travel\">the hundreds</a> of struggling rural hospitals nationwide that <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105515\">have cut</a> maternal care services: \u201cAcross the country, rural hospitals have experienced ongoing challenges in ensuring sustainable access to high-quality obstetrics services.\u201d</p>    <p>The protesters didn\u2019t buy this explanation, which they assumed was a convenient excuse for Parkview to slash a <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/a-leading-money-loser-for-hospitals.html#:~:text=Obstetrics%20and%20delivery%20services%20are,recent%20analysis%20by%20Kaufman%20Hall.\">money-losing</a> service line. Standing at an intersection near the gargantuan Regional Medical Center last September, several women and their children held <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxlQsu6u_a7/?img_index=7\">handmade signs</a>, declaring in scrawled marker: \u201cSave DeKalbs OB Unit\u201d and \u201cParkview puts $$$ over mothers!\u201d</p> <p>That month, Michelle Dunn, one of the protesters, submitted an <a href=\"https://www.kpcnews.com/opinions/article_034e33ef-bcb1-59f4-ab77-1a71381cd7d5.html\">anonymous letter</a> to a local newspaper, which she told the Guardian she had received from a nurse working at Parkview DeKalb. \u201cShutting our unit down would be detrimental to women and their children especially when they cannot make it to Parkview Regional,\u201d the letter stated.</p> <p>Parkview executives largely ignored the women. A few weeks later, the anonymous writer\u2019s warning proved prescient.</p> <p>Late in the day on 10 October 2023, a 26-year-old named Taysha Wilkinson-Sobieski showed up at Parkview DeKalb looking pale, according to one current and one former hospital source.</p> <p>Parkview hadn\u2019t approved 24/7 onsite ultrasound coverage \u2013 a basic medical imaging tool \u2013 at the outlying hospital, according to two former Parkview employees with knowledge of the incident. But because of her vitals, the two former employees said, staff suspected she was bleeding internally due to an ectopic pregnancy, a potentially life-threatening condition in which an egg grows outside the uterus.</p> <p>Even after the closure of the labor and delivery unit, Parkview Dekalb still had OB-GYNs who did pre-scheduled procedures and an on-call general surgeon who had the technical skills to try to help Wilkinson-Sobieski, two current and two former Parkview employees told the Guardian.</p>    <p>But alongside the publicly announced unit closure, hospital executives had also quietly slashed on-call OB-GYN emergency coverage at Parkview DeKalb, so the de facto practice became for staff to transfer pregnancy-related emergencies to Parkview Regional Medical Center, a 20-minute drive away, one current employee and one former high-ranking Parkview employee with knowledge of the matter said.</p> <p>The transfer cost Wilkinson-Sobieski time she could not afford.</p> <p>When the young woman arrived at the regional hub, she was still conscious and doctors were waiting for her, according to a source familiar with her post-transfer care. Staff ran an ultrasound, put her to sleep with anesthesia, and began an operation to put a clamp across one of her fallopian tubes, which by this point had ruptured, the source said.</p> <p>They got to her too late. She had already lost too much blood. She never woke up again, the source said.</p> <p>Wilkinson-Sobieski was pronounced dead two days later. She left behind her husband, Clayton, and their one-year-old son, Reid.</p> <p>Afterwards, her family received a bill from Parkview, according to her husband and another person familiar with the matter.</p> <p>Parkview did not respond to numerous detailed questions from the Guardian about the sources\u2019 claims regarding the case, and declined to comment for a <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/health/2024/08/29/an-ectopic-pregnancy-emergency-goes-wrong-due-to-obgyn-hospital-closure/74542823007/\">previous story</a> about the case in the Indianapolis Star.</p> <p>In a previous statement to local press about its OB-GYN service cuts, Parkview <a href=\"https://www.wndu.com/2023/08/29/parkview-health-closes-birthing-centers-lagrange-dekalb/\">said</a> its \u201cunwavering commitment to healthy moms and babies\u201d was at \u201cthe heart\u201d of its new approach, which it claimed would create \u201cnew opportunities to optimize prenatal care, labor and delivery, and postnatal care\u201d.</p> <p>But current and former Parkview employees told the Guardian the case points to the dangers of treating medicine like a business.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you do about the ectopic? What do you do about the mom that comes in with a foot hanging out?\u201d said one current longtime medical provider at Parkview, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s why the practitioners routinely say, \u2018This cannot be quantified.\u2019 Medicine does not fit neatly into an Excel spreadsheet.\u201d</p> <h2>The duo that built \u2018Emerald City\u2019</h2> <p>With a <a href=\"https://www.us.jll.com/en/client-stories/parkview-regional-medical-center\">price</a> <a href=\"https://www.parkview.com/news/results/new-medical-tower-at-parkview-regional-medical-center-set-to-open-ahead-of-schedule\">tag</a> of over $600m, Parkview\u2019s Regional Medical Center \u2013 a campus of brick walls and glass panes \u2013 is one of the most expensive developments in north-eastern Indiana.</p> <p>When patients walk through the sliding doors of its main entrance, they enter a bright atrium. Light floods through the front windows, revealing its immaculate floors and a grayscale glass mural that includes engravings of surgery staff and a motto in cursive: \u201cGenerosity Heals.\u201d</p> <p>This is the house that Parkview built \u2013 and that the patients and employers of greater Fort Wayne paid for with some of the highest prices across the land.</p>    <p>The ever-expanding campus was a crowning achievement for Parkview\u2019s longtime CEO, Michael Packnett, who retired two years ago, having turned the system from a small community chain into a regional powerhouse.</p> <p>During his 16-year tenure, Packnett, a doughy-faced Oklahoman with a soft voice and a graying widow\u2019s peak, won near universal acclaim for his <a href=\"https://www.parkview.com/news/results/parkview-health-ceo-mike-packnett-announces-retirement-leadership-transition-at-end-of-year\">carefully cultivated</a> <a href=\"https://www.fwbusiness.com/news/article_bded6b5e-475f-5ccc-ac23-9b4c1596766e.html\">brand</a> of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bizvoicemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AAW-Packnett.pdf\">servant leadership</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Former employees, from nurses to executive team leaders, reminisce about how Packnett would walk the halls and shake the hands of subordinates, whom he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qrsPD5u1pw\">called</a> \u201cco-workers\u201d in public pronouncements.</p> <p>Even today, local critics of the hospital find it hard to believe Packnett could have been in the know about the hospital\u2019s more controversial charging and acquisition tactics. What they don\u2019t like, they sometimes ascribe to Rick Henvey, Packnett\u2019s longtime deputy and eventual successor. Henvey, a balding Texas native with a taut face, does not project Packnett\u2019s \u201ccare bear\u201d image, as one Republican lawmaker put it.</p> <p>But sources who dealt with both over their <a href=\"https://www.businesspeople.com/Post/4504/all-in\">23-year partnership</a> say that, in their business practices, the two were closely aligned.</p> <p>Henvey <a href=\"https://www.businesspeople.com/Post/4504/all-in\">followed</a> Packnett to Fort Wayne. What they built there, one of the wealthiest hospital systems in Indiana, they built together \u2013 a trajectory that was not inevitable.</p> <p>When the duo took over Parkview in 2006, Fort Wayne \u2013 then a city of around 250,000 \u2013 had a relatively competitive hospital market. Parkview had a slightly smaller regional market share than a for-profit competitor, and struggled with wobbly revenues, tough dealings with insurers, and a lack of bed capacity \u2013 causing it to sometimes lose patient referrals to its rival.</p> <p>With the arrival of Packnett and Henvey, the hospitals\u2019 operating revenues exploded, rising from about $700m at the close of 2006 to $1bn by the end of 2011 \u2013 a 40%-plus increase, though patient admissions only grew 11% during that period, according to Moody\u2019s Ratings reports from the time.</p> <p>Hospital industry rivals and insurance sources attribute a large part of Packnett\u2019s success in those early days to his team\u2019s aggressive acquisition of dozens of freestanding medical facilities, including doctors\u2019 offices, imaging sites and surgery centers.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://unitedstatesofcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Facility_Fee_report_R4V2.pdf\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.nihcr.org/analysis/improving-care-delivery/prevention-improving-health/hospital-outpatient-prices/\">hospital leaders</a> across the country, Parkview administrators sometimes reclassified these acquisitions as <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/moving-site-neutrality-commercial-insurance\">\u201chospital-based\u201d outpatient departments</a>, according to one former Parkview employee and two healthcare industry sources familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The reclassifications didn\u2019t fundamentally change the services offered and the facilities were <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2988668/\">not necessarily</a> on Parkview hospital campuses, sources asserted, but thanks to <a href=\"https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/~/media/files/insights/publications/2015/11/bipartisan-budget-act-2015/the-bipartisan-budget-act-of-2015-and-hopd-payment-reforms.pdf\">lax</a> <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/moving-site-neutrality-commercial-insurance\">Medicare</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/moving-site-neutrality-commercial-insurance\">commercial insurance</a> reimbursement practices, administrators could insert the hospital\u2019s tax identification number, a hospital address, and higher charges on to bills from these sites.</p> <p>\u201cSo Packnett shows up here from Oklahoma and he realizes he has unlimited dollars,\u201d recalled one rival hospital executive, who was operating in Fort Wayne at the time.</p> <p>Around 2010, Packnett and Henvey saw an opportunity for this kind of billing arbitrage across state lines in Bryan, Ohio. The town of less than 10,000 people had a small community hospital that was <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/2023/04/04/the-new-company-towns/\">fighting</a> to keep its independence as well as an ageing doctors group that was looking to cash out.</p> <p>Packnett and Henvey wanted both, according to the Bryan hospital\u2019s then CEO, Phil Ennen. But when the duo couldn\u2019t convince the local hospital to surrender, they settled for the doctors\u2019 practice, which had its own facility doing affordable imaging and lab work right across the street.</p> <p>Then the Fort Wayne not-for-profit executives jacked up prices, Ennen recalls.</p> <p>Suddenly, he said, patients in Bryan receiving imaging from the same personnel in the same facility, were on the hook for hundreds of dollars more in charges because of its <a href=\"https://www.medicalbillersandcoders.com/blog/ascs-vs-hopds-understanding-payment-difference/\">hospital-based reclassification</a>, a spike that sparked complaints from local employers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful aphrodisiac, right?\u201d said Ennen. \u201cWe can take \u2019em over and take their lab and their X-ray and make it ours, and charge our prices.\u201d</p> <p>Packnett\u2019s physician grabs also softened up hospital targets for poaching down the line, according to one former high-level Parkview employee. With the Bryan doctors\u2019 group now in Parkview\u2019s hands, Ennen noted, the system began siphoning referrals away from the Ohio community hospital \u2013 shifting hospital facility fees and future patient visits from Bryan west to Fort Wayne.</p> <p>Thirteen years later, <a href=\"https://www.bryantimes.com/parkview-excited-for-growth-in-ohio/article_1e352a91-a963-5769-8f18-211d336e9ce6.html\">struggling</a> with finances, the community hospital group that <a href=\"https://www.parkview.com/news/results/10022023-parkview-bryan-hospital-parkview-montpelier-hospital-and-parkview-archbold\">operated</a> the hospital in Bryan and another one in a nearby small town finally gave in and joined Parkview.</p> <p>\u201cThey put Parkview doctors in Ohio and took their volume away,\u201d recalled the former high-ranking Parkview employee. \u201cIt was a slow bleed.\u201d</p> <p>Announcing the affiliation, Tasha Eicher, Parkview\u2019s market president for north-east Indiana and Ohio, <a href=\"https://www.parkview.com/news/results/10022023-parkview-bryan-hospital-parkview-montpelier-hospital-and-parkview-archbold\">said</a> the system looked forward to \u201cseeing the impact\u201d it could have as \u201cboth a healthcare provider and a community partner\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018The more you code, the higher you code, the more credit you get\u2019</h2> <p>As Parkview took over formerly independent county hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, more and more patients were referred within its system, exposing them to the not-for-profit\u2019s meticulous revenue strategies.</p> <p>Within a few years of Parkview\u2019s acquisition of the formerly independent community hospital in DeKalb county, Indiana, in 2019, managers there were ranking doctors by revenue metrics, holding meetings about which practitioners had failed to hit their expected financials, and basing their bonus pay, in large part, on patient volume and new patient encounters, internal documents show.</p>    <p>Five former Parkview employees interviewed for this story asserted that this pay structure incentivized some practitioners to churn through dozens of patients a day and to steer them toward costly procedures and testing.</p> <p>\u201cThe more you code, the higher you code, the more credit you get, which would translate to bonuses,\u201d said one former Parkview office manager, who worked in the system for more than a decade.</p> <p>\u201cSomebody comes in with knee arthritis and basically they\u2019re having pain, but they haven\u2019t had any other treatment,\u201d recalled a former Parkview doctor, questioning how his colleagues weighed surgeries versus more conservative alternatives. \u201cThese guys will jump right to a knee replacement surgery.\u201d</p> <p>Revenue pressure was even brought down to the level of nurses \u2013 some of whom say they have been pushed to charge for the smallest of items from Kleenexes to batteries. One 2022 email, obtained by the Guardian, shows a supervisor at Parkview DeKalb telling nurses that she had reviewed their charts for the week and found they had \u201cmissed\u201d $50,000 in charges as a team. The following year, managers told staff to be more stringent about how many linen towels they handed out to patients \u2013 an initiative they termed \u201clinen stewardship\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me feel disgusting. It makes me feel dirty,\u201d said one current Parkview nurse, describing how staff have been made to charge for supplies and services down to the micro-level. \u201cWhy should I be trying to make sure that they\u2019re getting the most money that they can?\u201d</p> <p>In some cases, these volume and coding protocols resulted in enormous bills and significant additional revenue for the system, according to medical and legal records reviewed by the Guardian.</p> <p>In 2021, after a young girl went to the ER for an accidental razor cut, a doctor applied an \u201cadhesive skin affix\u201d, a special type of wound glue, on her finger for about 10 seconds, according to her mother. Afterwards, Parkview charged just over $85 for the glue capsule, about <a href=\"https://www.bettymills.com/skinaffix-skinaffix-surgical-adhesive-055-ml-12-ea-bx-msc091040z-medmsc091040z\">four</a> to <a href=\"https://medicalsupplypros.com/products/skin-affix-topical-skin-adhesive?variant=44171666882839&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwgfm3BhBeEiwAFfxrG7632XILHy7K1D-sVVhZrwg2wdozhobzvQTHfu4Yu2qeOx9LczGN8xoC1lsQAvD_BwE\">five </a>times the price listed online. The hospital also tacked another $295 on to the bill for the labor, which it classified as an intermediate surgical procedure, according to paperwork reviewed by the Guardian.</p> <p>In 2022, Indiana\u2019s attorney general <a href=\"https://events.in.gov/event/attorney_general_todd_rokita_and_team_achieve_29_million_settlement_in_medicaid_fraud_case\">announced</a> a $2.9m overbilling settlement with Parkview, which stemmed from allegations that staff at multiple hospital locations were using improper revenue codes for blood-clotting tests to score more Medicaid dollars.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.insideindianabusiness.com/articles/parkview-settles-with-state-over-billing-dispute\">statement</a> to local press, Parkview said it believed it was \u201cusing the correct billing code\u201d and denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The system has also previously argued it needs to \u201cmaintain a strong, stable financial position\u201d in order to provide millions of dollars in charity care to poor patients, though such charitable figures are themselves based on the system\u2019s high prices.</p> <h2>\u2018Take my pricing or no deal\u2019</h2> <p>Under Packnett, Parkview\u2019s growing ring of hospitals increased its leverage in contract negotiations with health insurers. Parkview had facilities that insurance companies effectively needed for their network plans in the Fort Wayne region, especially since local employers were afraid of making their workers leave their beloved chain, the one that had put its name on the local minor league baseball field and the local Y, according to two former Parkview employees and two Indiana insurance industry sources.</p> <p>\u201cThe hospital was like, \u2018Take my pricing or no deal,\u2019\u201d recalled one former Parkview employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-your-rising-health-care-bills-secret-hospital-deals-that-squelch-competition-1537281963\">confidential nature</a> of hospital-insurance bargaining.</p> <p>Marty Wood, president of the Insurance Institute of Indiana, a lobbying group, told the Guardian<em> </em>that Parkview has been known to force insurance companies in negotiations to accept \u201call or nothing\u201d agreements as part of their contracts. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/HealthyCompetition\">All or nothing</a>\u201d <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/empowering-state-attorneys-general-to-fight-health-care-consolidation/\">agreements</a> make insurers keep all of a system\u2019s hospitals in their networks, regardless of their quality or costs \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/managed-care-outlook-2024/2024/01/antitrust-developments-in-2024-that-will-impact-managed-care\">arrangement</a> that the California attorney general\u2019s office and class-action attorneys in other parts of the country <a href=\"https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2018-04-05-california-attorney-general-and-sutter-health-face-antitrust\">have</a> <a href=\"https://riskandinsurance.com/health-care-systems-all-or-nothing-contracts-called-into-question-class-action-filed-by-patients/\">investigated</a> as part of antitrust cases.</p> <p>\u201cThat has absolutely got to drive up the overall costs,\u201d Wood said.</p> <p>Parkview did not respond to questions about whether it used \u201call or nothing\u201d agreements.</p>    <p>With this growing bargaining power, Parkview secured higher and higher payments from private health insurers throughout the 2010s.</p> <p>In 2011, commercial insurers were paying an estimated 233% of what the federal government was paying Parkview for the same services through Medicare. By 2019, that number had shot up to 282%. The same year, Packnett took home <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/351972384/202120719349300617/full\">more</a> in annual compensation than he ever had previously from the not-for-profit: $3.8m.</p> <p>The escalating costs sparked growing consternation among local employers. That May, the Employers\u2019 Forum of Indiana released a study it had <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3033.html\">commissioned</a> that found the once obscure regional system had some of the highest hospital prices in the country. </p> <p>Gloria Sachdev, the employer alliance\u2019s president, said Parkview had not taken her up on her offer to meet before its release, but after the New York Times reported on their findings, Packnett invited her to come in from the Indianapolis suburbs and discuss the study.</p> <p>So one morning that May, Sachdev drove into Fort Wayne, past the corn fields, hospital billboards and the minor league baseball stadium named after Parkview. At about 11am, she found herself at the head of a conference table inside the hospital\u2019s regional center, where C-suite leaders grilled her with methodological questions and expounded on their civic-minded efforts.</p> <p>After feeling like they had been going in circles for hours, Sachdev abruptly ended the meeting.</p> <p>\u201cYour job is not to provide revenue for the baseball field,\u201d she recalls blurting out to the hospital executives. \u201cYour job is not to provide revenue for the community outside of healthcare. Your job is to provide the best healthcare you can at an affordable price.\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards, Packnett, who had mostly stayed silent, offered to walk her out. As the two stood in the regional center\u2019s airy atrium, Sachdev said, the hospital CEO asked for her advice.</p> <p>\u201cHis concern was not about the prices. It was not about the impact to the community,\u201d Sachdev recalled. \u201cIt was about being in the New York Times and how he should manage that.\u201d</p> <p>Sachdev says she urged Packnett to be a local hero by lowering his chain\u2019s prices. The national news cycle, she told him, was short.</p> <p>Packnett nodded and looked relieved, she said.</p> <p>The following year, Anthem, the area\u2019s largest commercial health insurer, <a href=\"https://www.fwbusiness.com/news/health_care/article_8054761c-c2ba-59fd-8797-473a3e1a9e50.html\">used</a> Sachdev\u2019s price study <a href=\"https://www.anthem.com/parkview/?brandcd=ABCBS\">to bargain hard</a> with Parkview, and secured temporary reimbursement reductions. In 2021 and 2022, average prices at Parkview hospitals dropped out of the nation\u2019s top 10% most expensive hospitals. But in 2023, the system\u2019s average prices climbed once again into the top 10%.</p> <p>\u201cTo put it bluntly, I don\u2019t think they were committed and acting in good faith,\u201d Sachdev said of Parkview. \u201cThey gave a concession just to pacify people, then they just raised their prices again.\u201d</p> <p>A Guardian analysis of price transparency data from Parkview\u2019s Regional Medical Center found that prices increased at the flagship hospital in 2024. The Guardian US compared the cost of nearly 500 in-patient medical procedures in 2023 and 2024 and found that private insurance companies with more than 10 covered procedures saw an average price increase of 20% between 2023 and 2024.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/price-variation/giv-4559RpB0o58si8Tk\" data-alt=\"Graph of the price variation for procedures at Parkview Regional Medical Center\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/price-variation/giv-4559RpB0o58si8Tk\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The Guardian\u2019s analysis also showed just how much costs could swing at Parkview depending on a patient\u2019s coverage. \u200b\u200bParkview negotiates the cost of each procedure with each insurance company and on average, the difference between the maximum and minimum negotiated price varies by $30,000.</p> <p>Wood, the insurance lobbyist, called the spread \u201coutrageous\u201d and said it suggested that much of what determines hospital rates comes down to negotiating power, rather than real world costs.</p> <p>\u201cHow can that be for the same thing? It makes no sense,\u201d Wood said, referring to the differing procedure costs. \u201cThey\u2019re forcing the hand of certain payors to pay this much or not be part of their network. That\u2019s all I can think of.\u201d</p> <p>Parkview did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request to explain its price variations.</p> <h2>\u2018She could have easily died\u2019</h2> <p>The October 2023 death of Taysha Wilkinson-Sobieski \u2013 the young mother who had an ectopic pregnancy \u2013 did not spur change at Parkview\u2019s outlying hospitals.</p> <p>In the months that followed, according to one current and one former employee, Parkview hospital administrators did not restore OB-GYN emergency coverage service to two of its smaller hospitals: Parkview LaGrange and Parkview DeKalb, the local hospital Wilkinson-Sobieski had gone to for help.</p> <p>Nor did they make sure that the facilities had 24/7 ultrasound service \u2013 a level of service that is only provided at the regional center, according to internal hospital records from earlier this year obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>On New Year\u2019s Day, less than three months after Wilkinson-Sobieski\u2019s death, another woman who did not know she had an ectopic pregnancy walked through the doors of the ER at Parkview DeKalb.</p>    <p>For most of that day, Melanie Boterf, 33, had felt nauseous. She was having trouble breathing and felt pain between her hips. Worried about incurring a bill for her family, the stay-at-home mom had tried to sleep it off. But after she went to the bathroom and saw blood in her underwear, she drove to her local ER, leaving her husband, a sanitation truck driver, to watch the kids before his early shift the next morning.</p> <p>As in Wilkinson-Sobieski\u2019s case, Parkview DeKalb lacked ultrasound capabilities at night and OB-GYN emergency coverage \u2013 limiting the staff\u2019s ability to confirm whether Boterf had an ectopic pregnancy and to care for her if that was the case, according to medical records and a current Parkview employee. The ER doctor at DeKalb that night decided to transfer her, telling her it was because they couldn\u2019t run an ultrasound, Boterf recalls.</p> <p>Boterf says she was shocked. She had come to her local emergency room after all.</p> <p>\u201cThe moment that they told me I\u2019m not getting imaging here and I need to be transferred, I\u2019m like, \u2018OK what\u2019s the point of this being a hospital then?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At Parkview\u2019s Regional Medical Center, Boterf, whose vitals had stabilized, waited more than two and a half hours to be operated on. By the time the team ran her ultrasound, the imaging suggested that she had suffered a \u201cmoderate to large\u201d hemorrhage within her pelvis, an indication that one of her fallopian tubes might have ruptured, medical records show.</p>    <p>Fortunately for Boterf, afterwards a Parkview surgeon was able to stop her internal bleeding and save her life. But several medical experts interviewed for this story pointed out that the case could have ended differently. It was impossible to know when exactly Boterf\u2019s tube was going to burst, they said. If it had happened during her transfer, the experts said, she might not have survived.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t predict when it\u2019s going to happen. If it had happened on the truck she could have died,\u201d said a medical source, who used to work at Parkview DeKalb. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re filling a water balloon. It keeps going and just goes \u2018pow!\u2019 Then the hose is still going to bleed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe could have easily died in that ambulance going from hospital A to hospital B,\u201d said Dr Larry Melniker, an ultrasound expert and vice-chief of quality at New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist hospital\u2019s department of emergency medicine.</p> <p>In an internal meeting ahead of Parkview DeKalb\u2019s OB-GYN service cuts last year, hospital leaders claimed they had tried their best to recruit OB-GYNs, but had been struggling to find enough providers to maintain the same level of services, according to an audio recording obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cHealthcare is just rapidly changing,\u201d one executive told staff, in an apparent nod to the national OB-GYN <a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/4590535-the-united-states-is-experiencing-a-growing-ob-gyn-shortage-heres-why/\">shortage</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone in this.\u201d</p> <p>Some sources questioned this line. They point out that unlike struggling rural hospitals, Parkview has a deep bench of OB-GYNs at its main regional campus and that the cuts allowed the system to skimp on a low-reimbursement service line.</p> <p>Despite their resources, higher-ups have not been willing to make more of their OB-GYN physicians take call shifts at their semi-rural hospitals while investing enough to attract additional recruits there, according to two former high-ranking Parkview employees.</p> <p>The same month Wilkinson-Sobieski died, Parkview <a href=\"https://www.parkview.com/news/results/10022023-parkview-bryan-hospital-parkview-montpelier-hospital-and-parkview-archbold\">announced</a> it had absorbed the community hospital in Bryan, Ohio, along with two other medical facilities on that side of the Indiana-Ohio border.</p> <p>This fiscal year it found roughly $140m to pour into capital projects across greater Fort Wayne \u2013 investments that, a Moody\u2019s report from July noted, will help further its goal of regional expansion.</p> <p>The not-for-profit has enough resources to recruit more OB-GYNs for their outlying hospitals, one of the former high-ranking Parkview employees argued.</p> <p>\u201cThey have the money,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want to spend it.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jules Feeney and Aaron Mendelson contributed to this story</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"a thin grey line\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Methodology</h2> <p>The Guardian analyzed Parkview hospital prices using two different data sources. We used a metric called the commercial to Medicare cost ratio to analyze how pricey Parkview hospitals are compared to other hospitals around the country. This metric is an estimate of how much more a hospital charges private health insurance compared with what it charges Medicare and is based on records submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. The Guardian identified Parkview hospitals for each year from 2011 to 2023, and took each hospital\u2019s commercial to Medicare ratio from processed data available from the <a href=\"https://www.hospitaldatasets.org/\">RAND Corporation</a>. The Guardian found the 90th percentile commercial to Medicare estimate by analyzing every general hospital, an approach adapted from <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01476\">this research paper</a>.</p> <p>The cost of individual inpatient procedures are based on 2023 and 2024 hospital price transparency files from Parkview Regional Medical Center. The Guardian matched every procedure based on the name of the insurer and <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/ms-drg-classifications-and-software\">the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid classification number</a>. We matched 484 different medical procedure codes for 14 insurance companies and found four private insurance companies with more than 10 inpatient procedures in both 2023 and 2024, plus additional Medicare and Medicaid plans. We only compared the cost of one procedure for one insurer in each year to ensure an accurate year-to-year comparison.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On an October evening, Tom Frost was zooming down a dark state road on the northern edge of Indiana. The father of two had just finished his shift at a small-town fiberglass factory. Now, he was doing what he loved, riding a Harley-Davidson in his typical get-up: black gloves, leather chaps, no helmet. As Frost revved past the corn fields and thinning birch trees that led to his girlfriend\u2019s house, a green pickup jerked off a side road and into his path. Frost didn\u2019t have time. He hit the truck and flew backwards, leaving his body and small trails of blood on the asphalt, police photos show. First responders loaded Frost, now incapacitated, on to a helicopter and flew him to the area\u2019s biggest hospital, Parkview Health\u2019s Regional Medical Center. The sprawling, near-million-square-foot campus had opened its doors a year earlier, the capital of a rapidly expanding empire of hospitals and doctors offices spreading out from Fort Wayne to the rural counties of the Indiana-Ohio borderlands. Parkview Health\u2019s doctors operated on Frost\u2019s fractured right leg and face. Eventually, he woke up from his coma. But for weeks afterwards, he suffered from significant brain trauma. He called his mother, who spent days sitting beside his hospital bed, \u201cNumber 1\u201d, not \u201cMom\u201d. So about a month after the 2013 crash, when a hospital employee pulled aside his mother and asked her to sign an agreement promising to pay for \u201call\u201d of her son\u2019s charges, the 66-year-old retired bartender signed where she was told. Frost\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know how much the bill was going to be. All she knew was that her son, who was uninsured, needed care. After Frost\u2019s discharge, Parkview Health, a not-for-profit system, sent him a letter outlining how much it wanted: $629,386.50. Frost\u2019s family was willing to pay, according to a subsequent court filing submitted by his attorney. But the bill was bigger than what they thought was reasonable. For example, after his high-level surgeries, Parkview transferred him to a skilled nursing facility, where he worked on his rehab and recovery for 55 days. For that period, the hospital wanted $144,487.73, in effect a daily charge of more than $2,600. An auditor hired by the family\u2019s attorney identified thousands of dollars in billing errors in the hospital\u2019s itemized statement, some of which the hospital later relented on. More significantly, based on federal billing guidelines, the auditor concluded the \u201cfair and reasonable value\u201d of the services Frost received actually amounted to $255,903.45 \u2013 still a hefty sum, but only about 40% of what the hospital was demanding. After a two-year legal battle that threatened to shed light on Parkview\u2019s closely guarded billing practices, the hospital had Frost sign a confidentiality agreement and settled the case for an undisclosed sum. But the enormous hospital bill Parkview sent to Frost was not an aberration. Over more than a decade, Parkview Health has demanded that the people of north-eastern Indiana and north-western Ohio pay some of the highest prices of any hospital system in the country \u2013 despite being headquartered in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which currently ranks as the No 1 most affordable metro area to live in the United States. For 10 of the last 13 years, Parkview hospitals on average have been among the top 10% most expensive in the country, a Guardian US analysis of cost estimates based on data submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid shows. Parkview\u2019s steep prices are the product of a more than two-decade campaign by hospital executives to establish market dominance in Fort Wayne and to squeeze revenue from a pool of patients and employers who feel they have no better alternatives, according to interviews with more than 40 current and former Parkview employees, patients, local business leaders, lawmakers and competitors, as well as leaked audio recordings of meetings and hundreds of internal billing, patient and policy documents obtained by the Guardian. During this period, Parkview has taken over six former rival hospitals and built up a network of almost 300 sites for its physicians and providers, forming a ring around its gleaming regional center, which some staff refer to in private as the \u201cBig House\u201d or \u201cEmerald City\u201d for its ritzy amenities and green corporate branding. This consolidation, former employees say, has allowed Parkview to control referral flows, routing primary care patients to their own costly specialists and facilities, even if those patients could get the same services elsewhere for less. It has also increased Parkview\u2019s leverage in negotiations with health insurance companies, as they bargain over procedure prices on behalf of employers that offer the insurers\u2019 health plans to their workers. Insurance industry sources say Parkview\u2019s growing web of hospitals makes it hard for any insurer to offer a viable health plan locally without including the chain\u2019s facilities in their network, an advantage that has helped the not-for-profit extract high prices and earn a reputation as one of the toughest negotiators in the state. Not-for-profit healthcare has been good business for Parkview as it has been for hundreds of other ostensible charities across the US which operate nearly half of the nation\u2019s hospitals. In exchange for generous tax breaks, these institutions are required to provide free and discounted care to poor patients, but many have faced criticism for skimping on charity care, demanding high prices and giving executives exorbitant salaries. Since 2019, Parkview has raked in more than $2bn in revenue annually, enabling the system to give dozens of its executives and top doctors six- and seven-figure annual compensation packages. Before his retirement at the end of 2022, Parkview\u2019s longtime CEO, an avowed Christian who publicly styled himself as a \u201cservant\u201d leader, took home nearly $3m from the not-for-profit, according to the system\u2019s last publicly available IRS disclosure. Parkview declined repeated requests in recent weeks to make its current CEO available for interview and chose not to respond to a series of detailed questions submitted by the Guardian several days ahead of publication. In response to criticism about its high prices, Parkview has previously pointed to its various charitable initiatives, its role as a leader in the region\u2019s economic development, and the quality of its care \u2013 which varies by facility according to federal ratings. The system has also claimed that past studies of its prices have been \u201cfilled with inaccuracies\u201d and \u201cincomplete analyses\u201d. Parkview\u2019s expansion in Fort Wayne, a mid-sized, midwestern city surrounded by miles of corn fields and manufacturing plants, reflects a larger trend of consolidation that has transformed America\u2019s once mostly locally run healthcare system and ratcheted up its costs for more than a generation. Since the 1990s, hospital systems across the US \u2013 for and not-for-profit alike \u2013 have relentlessly chased after market power, executing nearly 2,000 mergers with little pushback from overwhelmed federal antitrust regulators and indifferent state authorities. Research from the American Medical Association found that by 2013, 97% of healthcare markets in the US had little competition and were highly consolidated under Department of Justice antitrust guidelines. By 2021, that figure had risen to 99%. With consolidation, academic researchers have consistently found significant increases in prices. A 2012 research survey concluded that when hospitals merge in concentrated markets price hikes were \u201ctypically quite large, most exceeding 20 percent\u201d. A 2019 study found that prices at hospitals enjoying local monopoly power were 12% higher than those in markets with at least four competitors. A study released earlier this year identified dozens of hospital mergers that it said regulators could have flagged as likely to diminish competition and raise prices. Those mergers did, in fact, result in average price hikes of 5% or more, the researchers found. Rising healthcare costs don\u2019t just hurt patients. They also squeeze local employers, who have to choose between wages, headcount and insurance costs \u2013 decisions that low-wage workers pay for down the line. A working paper from earlier this summer found that every 1% increase in healthcare prices, driven by hospital mergers, lowered both employment and payroll at companies outside the health sector by approximately 0.4% \u2013 trends, which in turn, increased deaths by opioid overdose and suicide. Zack Cooper, a Yale economist and one of the co-authors of that paper, argues that consolidation has its most pernicious effects in areas like north-eastern Indiana and north-western Ohio, where Parkview has established itself as the dominant player: semi-rural parts of the country which already had comparatively few healthcare providers and are even more vulnerable to consolidation and price hikes. \u201cThat\u2019s where you start to see these 10 to 15% price increases over time,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cOutside of New York, LA, Chicago and Houston, often the hospitals are really the biggest employers in town. They\u2019ve got these beautiful campuses and rolling grass lawns, and you say, \u2018Oh gosh, this is good for the economy.\u2019 But what we\u2019re starting to see is that many of our local health systems are boa constrictors just tightening around and squeezing the life of some of these local economies.\u201d The not-for-profit cut services. Then a young mother died Parkview Health is now north-eastern Indiana\u2019s largest employer. And as the hospital system has grown, it has refashioned greater Fort Wayne in its own image. Parkview has built its own police force with dozens of armed officers stationed across the region. It has stuck its green and gray colors on the jerseys of Fort Wayne\u2019s minor league baseball team, and paid millions to call their downtown stadium, \u201cParkview Field\u201d. Today, even the local hockey rink, \u201cSportOne Parkview Icehouse\u201d, and a local YMCA, \u201cParkview Family YMCA\u201d, pay homage to the not-for-profit. In Fort Wayne and its surrounding deep-red counties, business leaders and Republican state lawmakers have grumbled for years about Parkview\u2019s high prices \u2013 including several who spoke on the condition of anonymity for this story. But no major establishment figure has been willing to cross the hospital. Last summer, the biggest ever local challenge to the not-for-profit\u2019s carefully cultivated reputation came not from elected officials, but a spontaneous coalition of suburban and rural mothers from DeKalb county. The women, calling themselves \u201cMoms Against Parkview\u201d, were upset that the healthcare system had decided to shut down the labor and delivery unit at their local formerly independent hospital, which the system had absorbed and rechristened as \u201cParkview DeKalb\u201d in 2019. In a statement to the media, the prosperous not-for-profit likened itself to the hundreds of struggling rural hospitals nationwide that have cut maternal care services: \u201cAcross the country, rural hospitals have experienced ongoing challenges in ensuring sustainable access to high-quality obstetrics services.\u201d The protesters didn\u2019t buy this explanation, which they assumed was a convenient excuse for Parkview to slash a money-losing service line. Standing at an intersection near the gargantuan Regional Medical Center last September, several women and their children held handmade signs, declaring in scrawled marker: \u201cSave DeKalbs OB Unit\u201d and \u201cParkview puts $$$ over mothers!\u201d That month, Michelle Dunn, one of the protesters, submitted an anonymous letter to a local newspaper, which she told the Guardian she had received from a nurse working at Parkview DeKalb. \u201cShutting our unit down would be detrimental to women and their children especially when they cannot make it to Parkview Regional,\u201d the letter stated. Parkview executives largely ignored the women. A few weeks later, the anonymous writer\u2019s warning proved prescient. Late in the day on 10 October 2023, a 26-year-old named Taysha Wilkinson-Sobieski showed up at Parkview DeKalb looking pale, according to one current and one former hospital source. Parkview hadn\u2019t approved 24/7 onsite ultrasound coverage \u2013 a basic medical imaging tool \u2013 at the outlying hospital, according to two former Parkview employees with knowledge of the incident. But because of her vitals, the two former employees said, staff suspected she was bleeding internally due to an ectopic pregnancy, a potentially life-threatening condition in which an egg grows outside the uterus. Even after the closure of the labor and delivery unit, Parkview Dekalb still had OB-GYNs who did pre-scheduled procedures and an on-call general surgeon who had the technical skills to try to help Wilkinson-Sobieski, two current and two former Parkview employees told the Guardian. But alongside the publicly announced unit closure, hospital executives had also quietly slashed on-call OB-GYN emergency coverage at Parkview DeKalb, so the de facto practice became for staff to transfer pregnancy-related emergencies to Parkview Regional Medical Center, a 20-minute drive away, one current employee and one former high-ranking Parkview employee with knowledge of the matter said. The transfer cost Wilkinson-Sobieski time she could not afford. When the young woman arrived at the regional hub, she was still conscious and doctors were waiting for her, according to a source familiar with her post-transfer care. Staff ran an ultrasound, put her to sleep with anesthesia, and began an operation to put a clamp across one of her fallopian tubes, which by this point had ruptured, the source said. They got to her too late. She had already lost too much blood. She never woke up again, the source said. Wilkinson-Sobieski was pronounced dead two days later. She left behind her husband, Clayton, and their one-year-old son, Reid. Afterwards, her family received a bill from Parkview, according to her husband and another person familiar with the matter. Parkview did not respond to numerous detailed questions from the Guardian about the sources\u2019 claims regarding the case, and declined to comment for a previous story about the case in the Indianapolis Star. In a previous statement to local press about its OB-GYN service cuts, Parkview said its \u201cunwavering commitment to healthy moms and babies\u201d was at \u201cthe heart\u201d of its new approach, which it claimed would create \u201cnew opportunities to optimize prenatal care, labor and delivery, and postnatal care\u201d. But current and former Parkview employees told the Guardian the case points to the dangers of treating medicine like a business. \u201cWhat do you do about the ectopic? What do you do about the mom that comes in with a foot hanging out?\u201d said one current longtime medical provider at Parkview, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s why the practitioners routinely say, \u2018This cannot be quantified.\u2019 Medicine does not fit neatly into an Excel spreadsheet.\u201d The duo that built \u2018Emerald City\u2019 With a price tag of over $600m, Parkview\u2019s Regional Medical Center \u2013 a campus of brick walls and glass panes \u2013 is one of the most expensive developments in north-eastern Indiana. When patients walk through the sliding doors of its main entrance, they enter a bright atrium. Light floods through the front windows, revealing its immaculate floors and a grayscale glass mural that includes engravings of surgery staff and a motto in cursive: \u201cGenerosity Heals.\u201d This is the house that Parkview built \u2013 and that the patients and employers of greater Fort Wayne paid for with some of the highest prices across the land. The ever-expanding campus was a crowning achievement for Parkview\u2019s longtime CEO, Michael Packnett, who retired two years ago, having turned the system from a small community chain into a regional powerhouse. During his 16-year tenure, Packnett, a doughy-faced Oklahoman with a soft voice and a graying widow\u2019s peak, won near universal acclaim for his carefully cultivated brand of \u201cservant leadership\u201d. Former employees, from nurses to executive team leaders, reminisce about how Packnett would walk the halls and shake the hands of subordinates, whom he called \u201cco-workers\u201d in public pronouncements. Even today, local critics of the hospital find it hard to believe Packnett could have been in the know about the hospital\u2019s more controversial charging and acquisition tactics. What they don\u2019t like, they sometimes ascribe to Rick Henvey, Packnett\u2019s longtime deputy and eventual successor. Henvey, a balding Texas native with a taut face, does not project Packnett\u2019s \u201ccare bear\u201d image, as one Republican lawmaker put it. But sources who dealt with both over their 23-year partnership say that, in their business practices, the two were closely aligned. Henvey followed Packnett to Fort Wayne. What they built there, one of the wealthiest hospital systems in Indiana, they built together \u2013 a trajectory that was not inevitable. When the duo took over Parkview in 2006, Fort Wayne \u2013 then a city of around 250,000 \u2013 had a relatively competitive hospital market. Parkview had a slightly smaller regional market share than a for-profit competitor, and struggled with wobbly revenues, tough dealings with insurers, and a lack of bed capacity \u2013 causing it to sometimes lose patient referrals to its rival. With the arrival of Packnett and Henvey, the hospitals\u2019 operating revenues exploded, rising from about $700m at the close of 2006 to $1bn by the end of 2011 \u2013 a 40%-plus increase, though patient admissions only grew 11% during that period, according to Moody\u2019s Ratings reports from the time. Hospital industry rivals and insurance sources attribute a large part of Packnett\u2019s success in those early days to his team\u2019s aggressive acquisition of dozens of freestanding medical facilities, including doctors\u2019 offices, imaging sites and surgery centers. Like many hospital leaders across the country, Parkview administrators sometimes reclassified these acquisitions as \u201chospital-based\u201d outpatient departments, according to one former Parkview employee and two healthcare industry sources familiar with the matter. The reclassifications didn\u2019t fundamentally change the services offered and the facilities were not necessarily on Parkview hospital campuses, sources asserted, but thanks to lax Medicare and commercial insurance reimbursement practices, administrators could insert the hospital\u2019s tax identification number, a hospital address, and higher charges on to bills from these sites. \u201cSo Packnett shows up here from Oklahoma and he realizes he has unlimited dollars,\u201d recalled one rival hospital executive, who was operating in Fort Wayne at the time. Around 2010, Packnett and Henvey saw an opportunity for this kind of billing arbitrage across state lines in Bryan, Ohio. The town of less than 10,000 people had a small community hospital that was fighting to keep its independence as well as an ageing doctors group that was looking to cash out. Packnett and Henvey wanted both, according to the Bryan hospital\u2019s then CEO, Phil Ennen. But when the duo couldn\u2019t convince the local hospital to surrender, they settled for the doctors\u2019 practice, which had its own facility doing affordable imaging and lab work right across the street. Then the Fort Wayne not-for-profit executives jacked up prices, Ennen recalls. Suddenly, he said, patients in Bryan receiving imaging from the same personnel in the same facility, were on the hook for hundreds of dollars more in charges because of its hospital-based reclassification, a spike that sparked complaints from local employers. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful aphrodisiac, right?\u201d said Ennen. \u201cWe can take \u2019em over and take their lab and their X-ray and make it ours, and charge our prices.\u201d Packnett\u2019s physician grabs also softened up hospital targets for poaching down the line, according to one former high-level Parkview employee. With the Bryan doctors\u2019 group now in Parkview\u2019s hands, Ennen noted, the system began siphoning referrals away from the Ohio community hospital \u2013 shifting hospital facility fees and future patient visits from Bryan west to Fort Wayne. Thirteen years later, struggling with finances, the community hospital group that operated the hospital in Bryan and another one in a nearby small town finally gave in and joined Parkview. \u201cThey put Parkview doctors in Ohio and took their volume away,\u201d recalled the former high-ranking Parkview employee. \u201cIt was a slow bleed.\u201d Announcing the affiliation, Tasha Eicher, Parkview\u2019s market president for north-east Indiana and Ohio, said the system looked forward to \u201cseeing the impact\u201d it could have as \u201cboth a healthcare provider and a community partner\u201d. \u2018The more you code, the higher you code, the more credit you get\u2019 As Parkview took over formerly independent county hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, more and more patients were referred within its system, exposing them to the not-for-profit\u2019s meticulous revenue strategies. Within a few years of Parkview\u2019s acquisition of the formerly independent community hospital in DeKalb county, Indiana, in 2019, managers there were ranking doctors by revenue metrics, holding meetings about which practitioners had failed to hit their expected financials, and basing their bonus pay, in large part, on patient volume and new patient encounters, internal documents show. Five former Parkview employees interviewed for this story asserted that this pay structure incentivized some practitioners to churn through dozens of patients a day and to steer them toward costly procedures and testing. \u201cThe more you code, the higher you code, the more credit you get, which would translate to bonuses,\u201d said one former Parkview office manager, who worked in the system for more than a decade. \u201cSomebody comes in with knee arthritis and basically they\u2019re having pain, but they haven\u2019t had any other treatment,\u201d recalled a former Parkview doctor, questioning how his colleagues weighed surgeries versus more conservative alternatives. \u201cThese guys will jump right to a knee replacement surgery.\u201d Revenue pressure was even brought down to the level of nurses \u2013 some of whom say they have been pushed to charge for the smallest of items from Kleenexes to batteries. One 2022 email, obtained by the Guardian, shows a supervisor at Parkview DeKalb telling nurses that she had reviewed their charts for the week and found they had \u201cmissed\u201d $50,000 in charges as a team. The following year, managers told staff to be more stringent about how many linen towels they handed out to patients \u2013 an initiative they termed \u201clinen stewardship\u201d. \u201cIt makes me feel disgusting. It makes me feel dirty,\u201d said one current Parkview nurse, describing how staff have been made to charge for supplies and services down to the micro-level. \u201cWhy should I be trying to make sure that they\u2019re getting the most money that they can?\u201d In some cases, these volume and coding protocols resulted in enormous bills and significant additional revenue for the system, according to medical and legal records reviewed by the Guardian. In 2021, after a young girl went to the ER for an accidental razor cut, a doctor applied an \u201cadhesive skin affix\u201d, a special type of wound glue, on her finger for about 10 seconds, according to her mother. Afterwards, Parkview charged just over $85 for the glue capsule, about four to five times the price listed online. The hospital also tacked another $295 on to the bill for the labor, which it classified as an intermediate surgical procedure, according to paperwork reviewed by the Guardian. In 2022, Indiana\u2019s attorney general announced a $2.9m overbilling settlement with Parkview, which stemmed from allegations that staff at multiple hospital locations were using improper revenue codes for blood-clotting tests to score more Medicaid dollars. In a statement to local press, Parkview said it believed it was \u201cusing the correct billing code\u201d and denied any wrongdoing. The system has also previously argued it needs to \u201cmaintain a strong, stable financial position\u201d in order to provide millions of dollars in charity care to poor patients, though such charitable figures are themselves based on the system\u2019s high prices. \u2018Take my pricing or no deal\u2019 Under Packnett, Parkview\u2019s growing ring of hospitals increased its leverage in contract negotiations with health insurers. Parkview had facilities that insurance companies effectively needed for their network plans in the Fort Wayne region, especially since local employers were afraid of making their workers leave their beloved chain, the one that had put its name on the local minor league baseball field and the local Y, according to two former Parkview employees and two Indiana insurance industry sources. \u201cThe hospital was like, \u2018Take my pricing or no deal,\u2019\u201d recalled one former Parkview employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of hospital-insurance bargaining. Marty Wood, president of the Insurance Institute of Indiana, a lobbying group, told the Guardian that Parkview has been known to force insurance companies in negotiations to accept \u201call or nothing\u201d agreements as part of their contracts. \u201cAll or nothing\u201d agreements make insurers keep all of a system\u2019s hospitals in their networks, regardless of their quality or costs \u2013 an arrangement that the California attorney general\u2019s office and class-action attorneys in other parts of the country have investigated as part of antitrust cases. \u201cThat has absolutely got to drive up the overall costs,\u201d Wood said. Parkview did not respond to questions about whether it used \u201call or nothing\u201d agreements. With this growing bargaining power, Parkview secured higher and higher payments from private health insurers throughout the 2010s. In 2011, commercial insurers were paying an estimated 233% of what the federal government was paying Parkview for the same services through Medicare. By 2019, that number had shot up to 282%. The same year, Packnett took home more in annual compensation than he ever had previously from the not-for-profit: $3.8m. The escalating costs sparked growing consternation among local employers. That May, the Employers\u2019 Forum of Indiana released a study it had commissioned that found the once obscure regional system had some of the highest hospital prices in the country. Gloria Sachdev, the employer alliance\u2019s president, said Parkview had not taken her up on her offer to meet before its release, but after the New York Times reported on their findings, Packnett invited her to come in from the Indianapolis suburbs and discuss the study. So one morning that May, Sachdev drove into Fort Wayne, past the corn fields, hospital billboards and the minor league baseball stadium named after Parkview. At about 11am, she found herself at the head of a conference table inside the hospital\u2019s regional center, where C-suite leaders grilled her with methodological questions and expounded on their civic-minded efforts. After feeling like they had been going in circles for hours, Sachdev abruptly ended the meeting. \u201cYour job is not to provide revenue for the baseball field,\u201d she recalls blurting out to the hospital executives. \u201cYour job is not to provide revenue for the community outside of healthcare. Your job is to provide the best healthcare you can at an affordable price.\u201d Afterwards, Packnett, who had mostly stayed silent, offered to walk her out. As the two stood in the regional center\u2019s airy atrium, Sachdev said, the hospital CEO asked for her advice. \u201cHis concern was not about the prices. It was not about the impact to the community,\u201d Sachdev recalled. \u201cIt was about being in the New York Times and how he should manage that.\u201d Sachdev says she urged Packnett to be a local hero by lowering his chain\u2019s prices. The national news cycle, she told him, was short. Packnett nodded and looked relieved, she said. The following year, Anthem, the area\u2019s largest commercial health insurer, used Sachdev\u2019s price study to bargain hard with Parkview, and secured temporary reimbursement reductions. In 2021 and 2022, average prices at Parkview hospitals dropped out of the nation\u2019s top 10% most expensive hospitals. But in 2023, the system\u2019s average prices climbed once again into the top 10%. \u201cTo put it bluntly, I don\u2019t think they were committed and acting in good faith,\u201d Sachdev said of Parkview. \u201cThey gave a concession just to pacify people, then they just raised their prices again.\u201d A Guardian analysis of price transparency data from Parkview\u2019s Regional Medical Center found that prices increased at the flagship hospital in 2024. The Guardian US compared the cost of nearly 500 in-patient medical procedures in 2023 and 2024 and found that private insurance companies with more than 10 covered procedures saw an average price increase of 20% between 2023 and 2024. The Guardian\u2019s analysis also showed just how much costs could swing at Parkview depending on a patient\u2019s coverage. Parkview negotiates the cost of each procedure with each insurance company and on average, the difference between the maximum and minimum negotiated price varies by $30,000. Wood, the insurance lobbyist, called the spread \u201coutrageous\u201d and said it suggested that much of what determines hospital rates comes down to negotiating power, rather than real world costs. \u201cHow can that be for the same thing? It makes no sense,\u201d Wood said, referring to the differing procedure costs. \u201cThey\u2019re forcing the hand of certain payors to pay this much or not be part of their network. That\u2019s all I can think of.\u201d Parkview did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request to explain its price variations. \u2018She could have easily died\u2019 The October 2023 death of Taysha Wilkinson-Sobieski \u2013 the young mother who had an ectopic pregnancy \u2013 did not spur change at Parkview\u2019s outlying hospitals. In the months that followed, according to one current and one former employee, Parkview hospital administrators did not restore OB-GYN emergency coverage service to two of its smaller hospitals: Parkview LaGrange and Parkview DeKalb, the local hospital Wilkinson-Sobieski had gone to for help. Nor did they make sure that the facilities had 24/7 ultrasound service \u2013 a level of service that is only provided at the regional center, according to internal hospital records from earlier this year obtained by the Guardian. On New Year\u2019s Day, less than three months after Wilkinson-Sobieski\u2019s death, another woman who did not know she had an ectopic pregnancy walked through the doors of the ER at Parkview DeKalb. For most of that day, Melanie Boterf, 33, had felt nauseous. She was having trouble breathing and felt pain between her hips. Worried about incurring a bill for her family, the stay-at-home mom had tried to sleep it off. But after she went to the bathroom and saw blood in her underwear, she drove to her local ER, leaving her husband, a sanitation truck driver, to watch the kids before his early shift the next morning. As in Wilkinson-Sobieski\u2019s case, Parkview DeKalb lacked ultrasound capabilities at night and OB-GYN emergency coverage \u2013 limiting the staff\u2019s ability to confirm whether Boterf had an ectopic pregnancy and to care for her if that was the case, according to medical records and a current Parkview employee. The ER doctor at DeKalb that night decided to transfer her, telling her it was because they couldn\u2019t run an ultrasound, Boterf recalls. Boterf says she was shocked. She had come to her local emergency room after all. \u201cThe moment that they told me I\u2019m not getting imaging here and I need to be transferred, I\u2019m like, \u2018OK what\u2019s the point of this being a hospital then?\u2019\u201d At Parkview\u2019s Regional Medical Center, Boterf, whose vitals had stabilized, waited more than two and a half hours to be operated on. By the time the team ran her ultrasound, the imaging suggested that she had suffered a \u201cmoderate to large\u201d hemorrhage within her pelvis, an indication that one of her fallopian tubes might have ruptured, medical records show. Fortunately for Boterf, afterwards a Parkview surgeon was able to stop her internal bleeding and save her life. But several medical experts interviewed for this story pointed out that the case could have ended differently. It was impossible to know when exactly Boterf\u2019s tube was going to burst, they said. If it had happened during her transfer, the experts said, she might not have survived. \u201cYou can\u2019t predict when it\u2019s going to happen. If it had happened on the truck she could have died,\u201d said a medical source, who used to work at Parkview DeKalb. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re filling a water balloon. It keeps going and just goes \u2018pow!\u2019 Then the hose is still going to bleed.\u201d \u201cShe could have easily died in that ambulance going from hospital A to hospital B,\u201d said Dr Larry Melniker, an ultrasound expert and vice-chief of quality at New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist hospital\u2019s department of emergency medicine. In an internal meeting ahead of Parkview DeKalb\u2019s OB-GYN service cuts last year, hospital leaders claimed they had tried their best to recruit OB-GYNs, but had been struggling to find enough providers to maintain the same level of services, according to an audio recording obtained by the Guardian. \u201cHealthcare is just rapidly changing,\u201d one executive told staff, in an apparent nod to the national OB-GYN shortage. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone in this.\u201d Some sources questioned this line. They point out that unlike struggling rural hospitals, Parkview has a deep bench of OB-GYNs at its main regional campus and that the cuts allowed the system to skimp on a low-reimbursement service line. Despite their resources, higher-ups have not been willing to make more of their OB-GYN physicians take call shifts at their semi-rural hospitals while investing enough to attract additional recruits there, according to two former high-ranking Parkview employees. The same month Wilkinson-Sobieski died, Parkview announced it had absorbed the community hospital in Bryan, Ohio, along with two other medical facilities on that side of the Indiana-Ohio border. This fiscal year it found roughly $140m to pour into capital projects across greater Fort Wayne \u2013 investments that, a Moody\u2019s report from July noted, will help further its goal of regional expansion. The not-for-profit has enough resources to recruit more OB-GYNs for their outlying hospitals, one of the former high-ranking Parkview employees argued. \u201cThey have the money,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want to spend it.\u201d Jules Feeney and Aaron Mendelson contributed to this story Methodology The Guardian analyzed Parkview hospital prices using two different data sources. We used a metric called the commercial to Medicare cost ratio to analyze how pricey Parkview hospitals are compared to other hospitals around the country. This metric is an estimate of how much more a hospital charges private health insurance compared with what it charges Medicare and is based on records submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. The Guardian identified Parkview hospitals for each year from 2011 to 2023, and took each hospital\u2019s commercial to Medicare ratio from processed data available from the RAND Corporation. The Guardian found the 90th percentile commercial to Medicare estimate by analyzing every general hospital, an approach adapted from this research paper. The cost of individual inpatient procedures are based on 2023 and 2024 hospital price transparency files from Parkview Regional Medical Center. The Guardian matched every procedure based on the name of the insurer and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid classification number. We matched 484 different medical procedure codes for 14 insurance companies and found four private insurance companies with more than 10 inpatient procedures in both 2023 and 2024, plus additional Medicare and Medicaid plans. We only compared the cost of one procedure for one insurer in each year to ensure an accurate year-to-year comparison.",

Musicians and other public figures shared tributes to the former One Direction member, while hundreds of heartbroken fans gathered outside CasaSur Palermo hotel to light candles in his memory. The former One Direction member died on Wednesday at 5pm local time. \u201cLiam James Payne, composer and guitarist, former member of the band One Direction, died today after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Palermo,\u201d Buenos Aires police said. An investigation and autopsy was under way, according to authorities. What have police said? They were called to the hotel due to an \u201caggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol\u201d, according to Reuters. What about hotel staff? The manager said he heard a loud noise towards the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen off his balcony. Kamala Harris pledges break from Biden presidency in Fox News interview Kamala Harris has said her presidency \u201cwould not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency\u201d in her first interview with Fox News on Wednesday night as she criticized Donald Trump over his authoritarian rhetoric. The 25-minute interview with the rightwing, Trump-supporting channel was conducted after Harris held a rally in Pennsylvania with more than 100 Republican officials who oppose Trump. Harris had previously said that there was \u201cnot a thing that comes to mind\u201d that she would have changed under Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2013 a comment which has proved to be fertile ground for attack by Republicans as they highlight her continuity from the unpopular Biden administration. But on Wednesday she did a U-turn on her comment, saying: \u201cLet me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, and like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.\u201d She added that she was open to ideas from Republicans and the business sector. What topics did the interview cover? They included immigration, the rights of transgender people and Joe Biden\u2019s performance. Trump stands by debunked claims immigrants are eating pets at event for Hispanic voters Donald Trump doubled down on misinformation about immigrants as he faced questions from undecided Hispanic voters on Tuesday, during a town hall hosted by Univision, the largest US Spanish-language network. Trump, who has been trying to bring Latino voters onside, did not mention his plans to order the largest mass deportation in US history. He dodged questions, including on who would do much of the US\u2019s intense farmwork if he deported the many undocumented workers currently in these jobs. When asked why he kept repeating the debunked myth that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, Trump stood by the lie. \u201cI was just saying what was reported,\u201d Trump said, adding that migrants were \u201ceating other things too, that they\u2019re not supposed to\u201d. Is he making inroads with Latino voters \u2013 and if so, why? Polls suggest the answer is yes, with their support stemming from economic issues.

Reeves is drawing up plans for \u00a340bn in tax rises and spending cuts to avoid the real-terms cuts to departments that had been baked in under the last government\u2019s plans. It emerged this week that several cabinet ministers have written to Starmer to contest planned cuts to their department. The chancellor is also looking at increasing the national insurance contributions paid by businesses. The Guardian revealed this month that Reeves was considering levying NI on employers\u2019 pension contributions, which thinktanks say could bring in \u00a312-\u00a317bn. Increasing businesses\u2019 NI contributions will be controversial and has provoked a backlash from industry groups, who have called it a tax on jobs, but Starmer and Reeves have refused to rule it out. The prime minister told the BBC that Labour was \u201cvery clear in the manifesto that we wouldn\u2019t be increasing tax on working people\u201d but had made no commitments on employers\u2019 NI contributions. There is also growing speculation that Reeves will increase fuel duty for the first time since 2011, when it was frozen by George Osborne.

      "body": "<p>Early in Colored Television, 46-year-old Jane Gibson imagines her past self peering through the window of the home she lives in. \u201cBrooklyn Jane\u201d would admire this architecturally interesting house on the hills overlooking Los Angeles, she thinks, and see within it an idyllic scene of family life featuring Jane\u2019s painter husband Lenny \u2013 \u201cFrom a distance, in his horn-rimmed glasses, reading his serious book, he would look like an inspired choice\u201d \u2013 and their two children, Ruby and Finn. The vision is warm, sophisticated, \u201ca&nbsp;Black bohemian version of the American dream\u201d.</p> <p>In this sly novel about dreams, ambition and race as performance, Jane\u2019s fantasy is telling. Because what she carefully edits out are the unlovely truths underneath its gleaming surface: that she and Lenny had been in couples therapy until their money ran out. That Lenny\u2019s paintings don\u2019t sell. That Jane has been toiling over a&nbsp;sprawling novel for 10 years, a \u201c400\u2011year history of mulatto people in fictional form\u201d, which she must publish in order to get tenure. That her son\u2019s unusual behaviour may merit a doctor\u2019s diagnosis. And, finally, that the beautiful house and its accoutrements don\u2019t belong to them; the family are merely house sitting for Jane\u2019s wealthy screenwriter friend Brett, because the only places they can afford in the greater LA area are \u201cnot just overpriced but ugly, smelly, and dark\u201d.</p> <p>Danzy Senna has made a career of investigating the delicate psychological terrain that comes with being biracial, and Colored Television, her sixth book, is no exception. Interspersed throughout the novel are quotes from a fictional scholar, a white man who argues that \u201cthe mulatto in America would always remain poised between worlds, in psychological uncertainty \u2013 \u2018an other even amongst others\u2019\u201d. Even as we take his words with ambivalence \u2013 they drip with condescension and a need to categorise \u2013 we see his observations resonate with Jane\u2019s life.</p> <p>A sense of playacting pervades the&nbsp;novel. When Jane interacts with others, she feels herself slipping into what she calls \u201cthat mulatto mirroring thing\u201d, where she adopts the verbal style of whoever she\u2019s talking to. She finally finishes her novel, but her editor and agent refuse to publish it. Desperate, she attempts the world of&nbsp;television, where she tries her best&nbsp;to inhabit the role of a witty, intelligent novelist, a creator of high art. She dons various outfits that never quite seem appropriate: she overdresses for a late-night brainstorming session and meets the head of the network looking like \u201csome kind of 14-year-old skater boy\u201d. She can\u2019t shake a nagging feeling of impostor syndrome. \u201cAnd which part was she faking?\u201d Jane wonders. \u201cThat she was a television writer or that she was a novelist? That she was Black or that she was white?\u201d</p> <p>To make matters worse, her success&nbsp;in television seems to hinge on&nbsp;her&nbsp;ability to perform her identity \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 to the utmost. The centre of her new universe is Hampton Ford, a powerful Black producer to&nbsp;whom she pitches a lighthearted comedy that just happens to feature a&nbsp;biracial family, a show that might redress the tendency to portray mixed-race characters as either \u201cdangerously sexual\u201d or \u201csad and mopey\u201d. Initially, Hampton is eager to work with her: her status as a novelist promises to lend a \u201cpremium\u201d air to their putative show. But Jane remains desperate to please him even as he delivers unhinged disquisitions on \u201cmixed nuts\u201d and dismisses her ideas as not biracial enough. \u201cJust remember, we\u2019re trying to represent,\u201d he tells her. \u201cThat\u2019s the magic word here. <em>Represent</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Senna wants us to ask: represent what, exactly? Her novel resists obvious answers, rejects the attempt to neatly package something as complex and ordinary as a human life. Near the end, Jane herself looks through the windows of the house at her family. The view seems \u201cflat, staged, an imitation of life\u201d \u2013 the architecturally interesting house, we&nbsp;realise, is itself a sort of gigantic television. But even as Jane grasps that her picture-perfect dreams are hollow, we gain a poignant sense of their source: an unmoored childhood bouncing between her divorced Black father and white mother \u2013 a youth spent, appropriately enough, watching TV. It\u2019s a scene that perfectly sums up this allusive, artfully assembled book.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Colored Television by Danzy Senna is published by Dialogue (\u00a322).

      "bodyText": "Early in Colored Television, 46-year-old Jane Gibson imagines her past self peering through the window of the home she lives in. \u201cBrooklyn Jane\u201d would admire this architecturally interesting house on the hills overlooking Los Angeles, she thinks, and see within it an idyllic scene of family life featuring Jane\u2019s painter husband Lenny \u2013 \u201cFrom a distance, in his horn-rimmed glasses, reading his serious book, he would look like an inspired choice\u201d \u2013 and their two children, Ruby and Finn. The vision is warm, sophisticated, \u201ca Black bohemian version of the American dream\u201d. In this sly novel about dreams, ambition and race as performance, Jane\u2019s fantasy is telling. Because what she carefully edits out are the unlovely truths underneath its gleaming surface: that she and Lenny had been in couples therapy until their money ran out. That Lenny\u2019s paintings don\u2019t sell. That Jane has been toiling over a sprawling novel for 10 years, a \u201c400\u2011year history of mulatto people in fictional form\u201d, which she must publish in order to get tenure. That her son\u2019s unusual behaviour may merit a doctor\u2019s diagnosis. And, finally, that the beautiful house and its accoutrements don\u2019t belong to them; the family are merely house sitting for Jane\u2019s wealthy screenwriter friend Brett, because the only places they can afford in the greater LA area are \u201cnot just overpriced but ugly, smelly, and dark\u201d. Danzy Senna has made a career of investigating the delicate psychological terrain that comes with being biracial, and Colored Television, her sixth book, is no exception. Interspersed throughout the novel are quotes from a fictional scholar, a white man who argues that \u201cthe mulatto in America would always remain poised between worlds, in psychological uncertainty \u2013 \u2018an other even amongst others\u2019\u201d. Even as we take his words with ambivalence \u2013 they drip with condescension and a need to categorise \u2013 we see his observations resonate with Jane\u2019s life. A sense of playacting pervades the novel. When Jane interacts with others, she feels herself slipping into what she calls \u201cthat mulatto mirroring thing\u201d, where she adopts the verbal style of whoever she\u2019s talking to. She finally finishes her novel, but her editor and agent refuse to publish it. Desperate, she attempts the world of television, where she tries her best to inhabit the role of a witty, intelligent novelist, a creator of high art. She dons various outfits that never quite seem appropriate: she overdresses for a late-night brainstorming session and meets the head of the network looking like \u201csome kind of 14-year-old skater boy\u201d. She can\u2019t shake a nagging feeling of impostor syndrome. \u201cAnd which part was she faking?\u201d Jane wonders. \u201cThat she was a television writer or that she was a novelist? That she was Black or that she was white?\u201d To make matters worse, her success in television seems to hinge on her ability to perform her identity \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 to the utmost. The centre of her new universe is Hampton Ford, a powerful Black producer to whom she pitches a lighthearted comedy that just happens to feature a biracial family, a show that might redress the tendency to portray mixed-race characters as either \u201cdangerously sexual\u201d or \u201csad and mopey\u201d. Initially, Hampton is eager to work with her: her status as a novelist promises to lend a \u201cpremium\u201d air to their putative show. But Jane remains desperate to please him even as he delivers unhinged disquisitions on \u201cmixed nuts\u201d and dismisses her ideas as not biracial enough. \u201cJust remember, we\u2019re trying to represent,\u201d he tells her. \u201cThat\u2019s the magic word here. Represent.\u201d Senna wants us to ask: represent what, exactly? Her novel resists obvious answers, rejects the attempt to neatly package something as complex and ordinary as a human life. Near the end, Jane herself looks through the windows of the house at her family. The view seems \u201cflat, staged, an imitation of life\u201d \u2013 the architecturally interesting house, we realise, is itself a sort of gigantic television. But even as Jane grasps that her picture-perfect dreams are hollow, we gain a poignant sense of their source: an unmoored childhood bouncing between her divorced Black father and white mother \u2013 a youth spent, appropriately enough, watching TV. It\u2019s a scene that perfectly sums up this allusive, artfully assembled book. \u2022 Colored Television by Danzy Senna is published by Dialogue (\u00a322).

      "body": "<p>Naby Ke\u00efta\u2019s memories are inevitably tinged with regret when he looks back on his Liverpool career. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/28/liverpool-sign-naby-keita-rb-leipzig-next-summer-klopp-lemar-monaco?CMP=share_btn_tw\">Signed from RB Leipzig</a> for a then club-record \u00a354m after Liverpool paid a \u00a36m premium to ward off competition from others chasing one of Europe\u2019s most in-demand players, the Guinea midfielder was handed Steven Gerrard\u2019s famous No 8 shirt when he arrived at Anfield in 2018.</p> <p>But despite picking up the full set of winners\u2019 medals \u2013 from the Champions League and Club World Cup to Liverpool\u2019s first Premier League title \u2013 Ke\u00efta will always wonder what might have been after injuries restricted him to 49 league starts in five seasons.</p> <p>\u201cIt was tough mentally, of course,\u201d he says. \u201cI was the first to get frustrated. I wanted to play every game but unfortunately I had a lot of injuries that prevented me from giving more than I did. But that\u2019s the life of a footballer. I did everything I could to be there for the team at all times, but unfortunately injuries are part of our job.\u201d</p> <p>Ke\u00efta found it hard to settle and sustained hamstring and back injuries during his first few months. He still managed to score in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/09/liverpool-porto-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report\">Liverpool\u2019s victory over Porto</a> in the quarter-final as they went on to win the Champions League in his first season, although he had to miss the final against Tottenham owing to another injury. Yet even as Ke\u00efta\u2019s absences mounted and appearances became less frequent in the title-winning season and beyond, he never felt he was being criticised by the supporters.</p>    <p>\u201cThe Liverpool fans have given me a lot of love,\u201d he says. \u201cEven today, wherever I meet them, they show me the same love. They\u2019re the best fans in the world. Liverpool is a family and you never walk alone. My aim was to fulfil my childhood dream of winning titles. Winning the Premier League after 30 years, winning the Champions League \u2013 these are incredible moments that I can\u2019t forget. We won a lot of trophies and we were able to make our fans happy. That was the most important thing. This team was hungry. We wanted to win every game and we were lucky to have J\u00fcrgen Klopp to push us to give our best on the pitch. He\u2019s a fantastic coach and he was the strength of this group.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Ke\u00efta\u2019s finest hour came when he scored the first goal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/24/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool\u2019s 5-0 win at Manchester United</a> in October 2021. He left Anfield 12 months earlier than Klopp after returning to the Bundesliga and joining Werder Bremen on a free transfer.</p> <p>\u201cI had the option of extending my stay at Liverpool but, after five years, I wanted to get more playing time elsewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cI had several offers but I decided to sign for Bremen because Germany is a country I already know. I was also convinced by what the coach and management at Bremen had to say. I just wanted to play football, to be out on the pitch, making passes and scoring goals. If I wanted the money, I would have chosen to sign somewhere other than Bremen. Here, all that motivated me was to have the opportunity to play every weekend, enjoy myself and give pleasure.

      "bodyText": "Naby Ke\u00efta\u2019s memories are inevitably tinged with regret when he looks back on his Liverpool career. Signed from RB Leipzig for a then club-record \u00a354m after Liverpool paid a \u00a36m premium to ward off competition from others chasing one of Europe\u2019s most in-demand players, the Guinea midfielder was handed Steven Gerrard\u2019s famous No 8 shirt when he arrived at Anfield in 2018. But despite picking up the full set of winners\u2019 medals \u2013 from the Champions League and Club World Cup to Liverpool\u2019s first Premier League title \u2013 Ke\u00efta will always wonder what might have been after injuries restricted him to 49 league starts in five seasons. \u201cIt was tough mentally, of course,\u201d he says. \u201cI was the first to get frustrated. I wanted to play every game but unfortunately I had a lot of injuries that prevented me from giving more than I did. But that\u2019s the life of a footballer. I did everything I could to be there for the team at all times, but unfortunately injuries are part of our job.\u201d Ke\u00efta found it hard to settle and sustained hamstring and back injuries during his first few months. He still managed to score in Liverpool\u2019s victory over Porto in the quarter-final as they went on to win the Champions League in his first season, although he had to miss the final against Tottenham owing to another injury. Yet even as Ke\u00efta\u2019s absences mounted and appearances became less frequent in the title-winning season and beyond, he never felt he was being criticised by the supporters. \u201cThe Liverpool fans have given me a lot of love,\u201d he says. \u201cEven today, wherever I meet them, they show me the same love. They\u2019re the best fans in the world. Liverpool is a family and you never walk alone. My aim was to fulfil my childhood dream of winning titles. Winning the Premier League after 30 years, winning the Champions League \u2013 these are incredible moments that I can\u2019t forget. We won a lot of trophies and we were able to make our fans happy. That was the most important thing. This team was hungry. We wanted to win every game and we were lucky to have J\u00fcrgen Klopp to push us to give our best on the pitch. He\u2019s a fantastic coach and he was the strength of this group.\u201d Perhaps Ke\u00efta\u2019s finest hour came when he scored the first goal in Liverpool\u2019s 5-0 win at Manchester United in October 2021. He left Anfield 12 months earlier than Klopp after returning to the Bundesliga and joining Werder Bremen on a free transfer. \u201cI had the option of extending my stay at Liverpool but, after five years, I wanted to get more playing time elsewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cI had several offers but I decided to sign for Bremen because Germany is a country I already know. I was also convinced by what the coach and management at Bremen had to say. I just wanted to play football, to be out on the pitch, making passes and scoring goals. If I wanted the money, I would have chosen to sign somewhere other than Bremen. Here, all that motivated me was to have the opportunity to play every weekend, enjoy myself and give pleasure. Unfortunately, things haven\u2019t gone according to plan.\u201d Ke\u00efta has been used sparingly by Bremen\u2019s coach, Ole Werner, and had made only one league start when, last April, he was suspended for the rest of the season and fined after being accused of not turning up for an away game against Bayer Leverkusen.

Wherever I\u2019ve been, from Salzburg to Leipzig to Liverpool, I\u2019ve always tried to be exemplary.\u201d Ke\u00efta held talks with Sunderland and clubs in Turkey over a potential move in the summer but remained at Bremen, where he is training with the under-23s. \u201cA lot of people say to me: \u2018Naby, you\u2019re injured, why don\u2019t you want to play for Bremen?\u2019 I say: \u2018No, I\u2019m fine.\u2019 Since I came back from the Africa Cup of Nations [in February], all I\u2019ve wanted to do is play for the fans and the club.

Levar Stoney, the Democratic mayor of Richmond, Virginia, a city of over 220,000, said he was aware how difficult it would be to resist Trump given the enormous powers at a president\u2019s disposal.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to autocrat-proof your city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to have backstops, and mayors are working in coalition to ensure they can be a backstop against these divisive policies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gillian Feiner, senior counsel of States United Democracy Center, a non-partisan group working to advance democracy and fair and secure elections, said that many organizations were evaluating the legal landscape and preparing for practical challenges should Trump win. \u201cState officials\u2019 awareness of the threat level is high,\u201d she said, noting that their alertness stood in contrast to 2016 when many states were taken by surprise by Trump\u2019s actions.</p> \n<p>Larry Krasner, the progressive district attorney of Philadelphia with whom Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/defending-portland-crackdown-trump-pledges-to-deploys-feds-to-chicago-and-other-us-cities-led-by-democrats/2020/07/20/fda42b8a-caaa-11ea-89ce-ac7d5e4a5a38_story.html\">clashed several times</a> during his presidency, said he was taking the former president at his word. \u201cIt is incredibly serious for big cities that lean strongly Democratic, as Philadelphia does, when a potential president who identifies with dictators all over the world talks about conferring on federal authorities powers they do not have.\u201d</p> \n<p>Krasner predicted that Trump would face severe blowback if he tried to carry out any of his menaces. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let somebody carry out a coup as soon as he\u2019s in office, whether with tanks or on paper. My father served in world war two, and countless Americans died to resist fascism. If anybody tries to orchestrate a coup they\u2019re going to encounter tremendous resistance.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s disdain for cities run by Democrats has been a consistent theme of his politics.

      "bodyText": "Senior Democrats in US cities are preparing to defend their communities in the event of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House after the former president has repeated threats that he would use presidential powers to seize control of major urban centers. Trump has proposed deploying the military inside major cities largely run by Democrats to deal with protesters or to crush criminal gangs. He has threatened to dispatch large numbers of federal immigration agents to carry out mass deportations of undocumented people in so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d cities. He also aims to obliterate the progressive criminal justice policies of left-leaning prosecutors. \u201cIn cities where there has been a complete breakdown of law and order \u2026 I will not hesitate to send in federal assets including the national guard until safety is restored,\u201d Trump says in the campaign platform for his bid to become the 47th US president, Agenda47. Trump provoked uproar earlier this week when he called for US armed forces to be deployed against his political rivals \u2013 \u201cthe enemy within\u201d \u2013 on election day next month. But his plans to use national guard troops and military personnel as a means to attack those he sees as his opponents go much wider than that, spanning entire cities with Democratic leadership. Mayors and prosecutors in several US cities are collaborating over strategies to minimize the fallout. Levar Stoney, the Democratic mayor of Richmond, Virginia, a city of over 220,000, said he was aware how difficult it would be to resist Trump given the enormous powers at a president\u2019s disposal. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to autocrat-proof your city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to have backstops, and mayors are working in coalition to ensure they can be a backstop against these divisive policies.\u201d Gillian Feiner, senior counsel of States United Democracy Center, a non-partisan group working to advance democracy and fair and secure elections, said that many organizations were evaluating the legal landscape and preparing for practical challenges should Trump win. \u201cState officials\u2019 awareness of the threat level is high,\u201d she said, noting that their alertness stood in contrast to 2016 when many states were taken by surprise by Trump\u2019s actions. Larry Krasner, the progressive district attorney of Philadelphia with whom Trump clashed several times during his presidency, said he was taking the former president at his word. \u201cIt is incredibly serious for big cities that lean strongly Democratic, as Philadelphia does, when a potential president who identifies with dictators all over the world talks about conferring on federal authorities powers they do not have.\u201d Krasner predicted that Trump would face severe blowback if he tried to carry out any of his menaces. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let somebody carry out a coup as soon as he\u2019s in office, whether with tanks or on paper. My father served in world war two, and countless Americans died to resist fascism. If anybody tries to orchestrate a coup they\u2019re going to encounter tremendous resistance.\u201d *** Trump\u2019s disdain for cities run by Democrats has been a consistent theme of his politics. In his 2017 inauguration speech he vented against the \u201ccrime and the gangs and the drugs\u201d within \u201cinner cities\u201d, dubbing them \u201cthis American carnage\u201d. During the turbulence following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, Trump sent hundreds of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers, including border patrol Swat teams from the Bortac unit, to Portland and Seattle to protect federal property in running battles with militant protesters. Democratic officials in Portland asked for the 750 officers to be withdrawn, saying they were exacerbating the crisis, and a later investigation by the DHS inspector general criticized the deployment as ill-conceived and poorly executed. A spokesperson for Portland\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, said that \u201ccity leadership and bureaus have been working for months in collaboration with our external partners to prepare for the upcoming election\u201d, but declined an interview request. Trump also deployed the national guard and Secret Service agents in the nation\u2019s capital in June 2020. Federalised officers used tear gas and flash bangs to disperse a Black Lives Matter crowd in Washington DC so that the sitting president could stage a much derided photo op in which he raised a Bible outside St John\u2019s church close to the White House. In total, federal Swat teams drawn from 16 government divisions were deployed to quell the nationwide civil unrest following Floyd\u2019s death, an audit from the Government Accountability Office found. In the build-up to November\u2019s election, Trump has made his attack on big liberal cities a central pillar of his re-election campaign. Ahead of the Republican national convention, which nominated him as presidential candidate, he called Milwaukee, host of the event, a \u201chorrible city\u201d. He has also denigrated Washington DC, telling a campaign rally last month that he would \u201ctake over the horribly run capital of our nation \u2026 clean it up, renovate it, rebuild it, so there\u2019s no longer a nightmare of murder and crime\u201d. The most searing of Trump\u2019s threats towards cities is that he will deploy the national guard, or even regular military forces, to combat urban protests and crime.

We don\u2019t have to wait any longer. We got to get crime out of our cities,\u201d he said, specifically referencing New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. *** Trump\u2019s plans to deploy forces inside the cities depends upon his ability to bypass constitutional limits that generally forbid the military to be used in domestic law enforcement. The one exception is the Insurrection Act, which allows presidents to use the military or to federalise the national guard in order to restore order or put down a rebellion that is preventing the execution of US laws. \u201cIf I thought things were getting out of control, I would have no problem using the military, per se,\u201d Trump told Time magazine in April. \u201cWe have to have law and order in our country.\u201d Feiner said that should Trump invoke the Insurrection Act, which would put the national guard under the control of the president as commander-in-chief, there would be \u201cenormous pressure to comply\u201d with his orders. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the end of the story.

      "bodyText": "Above the canopy of the tallest trees that vie for sunlight in the depths of the Peruvian Amazon, gas flares shoot into the sky. Below, Julio Cusurichi, 53, can see the thick, dark grease that clings to the leaves and the toxins leaking into the streams. \u201cOil and gas projects are coming closer and closer. They are expanding into new lands,\u201d says Cusurichi, a member of the Shipibo-Conibo people, a Goldman prize winner and one of Peru\u2019s foremost Indigenous leaders. \u201cOur territory is our life, but the government is auctioning off plots. It is a great invasion with a grave impact.\u201d Oil and gas have been extracted from some of Peru\u2019s most biologically diverse territories for decades. Now, researchers warn, companies are expanding further into the lands of some of the last uncontacted Indigenous peoples. Peru is home to one of the world\u2019s largest populations of \u201cpeoples in isolation and initial contact\u201d (Piaci), estimated at 7,500 by the government. Their territories comprise some of the most intact areas of the Amazon. Yet, recent analysis by Earth Insight has found that Peru\u2019s current and proposed oil and gas blocks overlap with 20% \u2013 or 1.6m hectares (3.95m acres) \u2013 of reserves for these communities. Researchers warn of devastating effects on health and the species-rich environment, with frequent spills coating the lush rainforest in black sludge. The consequences of this pollution are still being investigated, but initial conclusions are devastating. In Peru, women report nausea and miscarriages, while men talk about developing skin rashes and unexplained illnesses after oil and gas mining begins. According to Cusurichi, a health crisis is under way among uncontacted Amazonian peoples due to large-scale fossil fuel exploitation. In 2016, Peru\u2019s health ministry sampled 1,168 people living near one of the country\u2019s biggest oilfields. They found half had toxic metals \u2013 such as mercury, cadmium, arsenic and lead \u2013 in their bodies at rates higher than those recommended as safe by the World Health Organization. Exposure to arsenic and cadmium can cause various cancers, and cadmium can lead to kidney disease and reproductive problems. Continued exposure to mercury can cause neurological damage. \u201cWhenever oil companies \u2013 or any type of extractivist company \u2013 come, they bring diseases. We are condemned with sicknesses, nausea and open sores,\u201d says Fany Kuiru Castro, a Colombian Indigenous leader and chief of the coordinating body of Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon Basin (Coica). \u201cThey are putting the life and the cultural existence of Indigenous people at risk. It\u2019s a silent genocide.\u201d *** New roads built for the operations also open up remote areas to outsiders such as illegal loggers and drug traffickers, further increasing the risk of disease. In 1984, more than 50% of previously uncontacted Nahua people died from newly introduced diseases after oil exploration on their land. As one researcher said, the growing presence of oil and gas operations makes for \u201ca very crowded forest\u201d. The contamination of rivers is another severe concern, as water, crucial to the wellbeing of Indigenous communities, is affected. Between 2000 and 2019, there were at least 474 oil spills in the Peruvian Amazon, mostly from corroded pipelines and operational failures. After two oil barges collided in March near the Pacaya-Samiria national reserve, in the Loreto region, one witness described \u201cchaos\u201d as local people used their bare hands to \u201cscoop up the oil\u201d from the water. Tony Mori, a Peruvian Amazon botanical specialist, warned in 2016 that the impact of the oil spills could mean that communities in Loreto would \u201chave no fish nor land animals for food, nor fresh water to drink\u201d. The flora and fauna are at risk, too. Peru is home to the second-largest area of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil and has more than 12,000 species, including jaguars, sloths, river dolphins and macaws. It also plays a vital role in regulating the climate, storing vast amounts of carbon. Yet Peru\u2019s Amazon has already been weakened, losing more than 2.7m hectares (6.67m acres) of forest between 2001 and 2021, according to official figures. Oil and gas projects are a significant driver for deforestation, mainly as new access roads, drilling platforms and pipelines are built. Scientists have warned that the forest is approaching a \u201ctipping point\u201d, beyond which it could degrade into grassland. Edith Espejo, Earth Insight\u2019s programme manager, says: \u201cAdding fossil fuel infrastructure to these territories is adding tinder to an Amazonia that is already on fire.\u201d Oil exploration began in Peru in the 1920s and there was a production boom in the 1970s. Subsequent decades have seen an increase in the number of large-scale projects, making it one of the most oil-dependent countries in Latin America today. That is despite the International Energy Agency saying that countries must stop new oil and gas projects to avoid aggravating the climate crisis. *** The Peruvian government determines specific areas, or \u201cblocks\u201d, for hydrocarbon activities, which are then leased to state and multinational energy companies for exploration. The Peruvian environment ministry and the ministry for energy and mines did not respond to requests for comment. In the foreword of Peru\u2019s mining and metals investment guide 2024-25, foreign minister Elmer Schialer wrote that \u201ctoday, in modern Peru, mining constitutes almost 15% of the country\u2019s GDP\u201d and that the increase in the country\u2019s mining production is \u201cvital for the potential growth of our economy, the improvement of working conditions, and the family income of workers\u201d. The report describes the Amazon as a region \u201crich in petroleum and forest resources\u201d. Last year, a legislative proposal aimed to overlay 31 oil blocks on 435 Indigenous communities, compromising the protections of dozens of forest communities living in voluntary isolation, according to a report published by Ojo P\u00fablico and Instituto de Bien Com\u00fan. Espejo says that comprehensive environmental and social impact assessments were not conducted during the creation of these promotional oil and gas blocks, and that the responsibility is handed to private companies after they have already bought the lots. \u201cOil and gas blocks are threatening 20% of Piaci reserves.

Simon Cowell claimed to have thrown the band together \u201cin 10 minutes\u201d from solo contestants who had failed to progress any further than the bootcamp stage of the 2010 UK X Factor \u2013 despite the fact that one of them, the Wolverhampton-born Liam Payne, had at one stage been tipped to win the series for his initial audition: a version of the old standard Cry Me A River. One Direction ended the series as runners-up, and that, you could have assumed, was that \u2013 after all, the stock of the boyband was hopelessly low at the time.</p> \n   <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/21/how-i-fell-in-love-with-one-direction\">things didn\u2019t work out that way</a> at all. One Direction ended up being one of the definitive pop bands of their era, shifting 70m records, and becoming the first band in the history of the US Billboard chart to see their first four albums debut at No 1. On the most basic level, they were successful because they were talented, charismatic and good looking and, more importantly, because a little more effort seemed to go into their singles from the off. Their debut, What Makes You Beautiful, was infernally catchy; it addressed their female fans with a charming positivity and was rooted in a glossy take on powerpop rather the standard boyband approach of ballad or pop-R&amp;B. \u201cWhen we heard it,\u201d Payne noted, \u201cit wasn\u2019t what we expected \u2026 so it kind of fitted perfectly.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read more:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/17/after-one-direction-liam-payne-was-just-getting-started-his-death-is-a-heartbreaking-end\">After One Direction, Liam Payne was just getting started.

You can read our main report on Liam Payne\u2019s death here: Our tribute from music critic Alexis Petridis here: And a look back at his life in pictures here: We also have this report from Buenos Aires: Payne\u2019s former school, St Peter\u2019s Collegiate Academy in Wolverhampton, has posted this statement on its website: We are deeply saddened to learn of the sudden passing of our former student, Liam Payne. During his time at St Peter\u2019s Collegiate Academy, Liam was not only well-liked by his peers and teachers but also recognised for his talents. He made a positive impact on our school community, and his contributions will be remembered. Our thoughts are with Liam\u2019s family and friends during this difficult time. We extend our sincere condolences to all those affected by his passing. Former SAS: Who Dares Wins star Ant Middleton posted a tribute to Liam Payne on X. Middleton described Payne as a \u201ctalented positive man with a good heart.\u201d Food bank charity Trussell has paid tribute to singer Liam Payne for his \u201ccompassion and kindness\u201d in helping its work. In March 2020, Payne helped provide more than 360,000 meals to people struggling as a result of the pandemic and had spoken about wanting to \u201cplay my part in finding a solution to ensure people have enough money to buy their own food - and end the need for food banks\u201d. Trussell chief executive Emma Revie said: We are extremely saddened by the news of Liam Payne\u2019s death. Over the last four years, Liam was a generous supporter of Trussell and our community of food banks, not only funding the provision of more than 360,000 meals during Covid but also often joining us in calling for the solutions required to end the need for emergency food. We greatly appreciate the compassion and kindness he always showed to people facing hunger and hardship. His death is a very tragic loss, and our thoughts are with his loved ones.\u201d West Bromwich Albion posted a picture of Payne, a \u201cBaggies\u201d fan. Former The Xtra Factor presenter Konnie Huq said she told Liam Payne when Justin Bieber was on the show that he would \u201cbe as big as him one day\u201d and Payne was \u201cself-deprecating\u201d but \u201cabsolutely did get to that level\u201d. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI actually found out last night (about his death), but \u2018just a boy\u2019 is so right, because really all he\u2019s known in his adult, and pre-adult life as well to some extent, is being in the limelight, and, you know, thrust into this position of global fame, not just sort of being known in your own country, but everywhere, essentially.\u201d She added: \u201cBut I do remember we had Justin Bieber on the show, and Liam sort of had the same hairstyle, bore a striking resemblance, and so we got him to come on the show. He was really embarrassed to meet Justin. \u201cAnd then afterwards, I was like \u2018You will be as big as him one day\u2019 and he was actually kind of self-deprecating, it was quite mature of Liam, of the boys, and, you know, he absolutely did get to that level, but it\u2019s a lot for young people to take on. \u201cYour brain doesn\u2019t actually fully mature till you\u2019re 25 and if you think he\u2019s, you know... over 10 years before that his journey had already started, and now, with social media and the amount of news channels, you can\u2019t escape that sort of pressure and that level of fame, which I think makes it tougher. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had stories of sort of massive stars dying young, but I feel that the pressure in general is more in modern living.\u201d The Rolling Stones\u2019 Ronnie Wood said he was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d at the news a he posted a video of him performing on X Factor with One Direction. The Press Association reports: Payne, who was born in Wolverhampton, released his debut solo album LP1 in December 2019, which included the songs Polaroid, Familiar and Strip That Down featuring Quavo. The song was one of two tracks that reached the top 10 in the UK official charts, alongside For You with Rita Ora from the film Fifty Shades Freed - which the duo performed at the Brit Awards in 2018. Payne was in a high-profile relationship with Girls Aloud singer Cheryl between 2016 and 2018 and the couple had a son, Bear, in 2017. Payne first auditioned for The X Factor in 2008 when he was 14, singing Frank Sinatra\u2019s Fly Me To The Moon, with judge Simon Cowell telling him to return to the ITV talent show two years later. In 2010, he impressed the judges with a rendition of Michael Buble\u2019s Cry Me A River before being put with four other solo hopefuls at the boot camp stage of the competition - the group which later became One Direction. In 2012, the boy band won their first Brit Award for best British single for their debut track What Makes You Beautiful, before picking up the Brit global success award a year later. In 2014 and 2015 they also won best British video for Best Song Ever and You &amp; I respectively. After Malik left the band, the quartet won best artist video for Drag Me Down in 2016. They picked up the same award a year later for History. In August 2023, Payne postponed his scheduled tour of South America after suffering a \u201cserious kidney infection\u201d. He said the infection was something \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone\u201d and he had been instructed by doctors to \u201crest and recover\u201d. In October that year, he was banned from driving in the UK after admitting a speeding offence. The singer was reportedly travelling at 43mph in a 30mph zone and was banned from driving for six months, as well as paying a fine. In August this year, Payne was announced as a judge on a new Netflix show alongside former Destiny\u2019s Child singer Kelly Rowland and The Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger. The stars were to judge attempts to create a band, looking at the contestants\u2019 chemistry as they formed groupings in the musical competition series. The Guardian would like to hear your memories of Liam Payne \u2013 whether you met him, or appreciated his work as a musician. Wembley Stadium shared a picture on X of Payne performing: The band McFly posted: The Foreign Office confirmed it is in contact with authorities in Argentina \u201cregarding reports of the death of a British man\u201d. But a spokesman declined to comment any further, including on the identity of the man involved. The PA news agency reports that Payne\u2019s death comes after it was widely reported that his ex-fiancee, Maya Henry, had started legal proceedings, allegedly issuing a cease and desist letter for repeated contact. The US model, who was engaged to Payne from August 2020 until he announced their separation in June 2021, claimed in a recent TikTok video that, since their break-up, the singer would \u201cblow up my phone\u201d from different numbers. In the hours before his death, Payne reportedly posted a video on Snapchat saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day here in Argentina.\u201d Fellow boy band the Backstreet Boys also paid tribute, saying their hearts go out to \u201cDirectioners around the world.\u201d BBC Radio 2 DJ Zoe Ball posted on X \u201cDevastating news\u201d The DJ and music producer Zedd, who featured alongside Payne on the 2017 song Get Low, posted a tribute to the star on X. The BRIT awards posted: \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly sad to learn of the tragic passing of Liam Payne. Our thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family at this time.\u201d Anne Twist, mother of former One Direction bandmate Harry Styles , posted a broken-hearted emoji on Instagram, captioning it: \u201cJust a boy.\u201d Fans gather outside the Buenos Aires hotel to sing the band\u2019s songs and light candles. US singer Charlie Puth, a co-writer on Payne\u2019s 2017 song Bedroom Floor, said he was in \u201cshock\u201d after Payne\u2019s death. \u201cLiam was always so kind to me,\u201d he posted on Instagram, alongside a collection of photos of the pair working together. \u201cHe was one of the first major artists I got to work with. I cannot believe he is gone... I am so upset right now, may he rest in peace.\u201d The Wanted star Max George said he met Payne while he was competing on The X Factor with One Direction, describing his death as \u201cabsolutely devastating news\u201d. He wrote on Instagram: Over the last few years I had the pleasure of getting to know him personally and spent some treasured time with him. Liam was absolutely wonderful in terms of support when Tom (Parker) fell ill, performing at the Royal Albert Hall with us for Stand Up To Cancer. He supported me a lot personally after Tom passed. I will never forget that. Payne attended the funeral of Parker, who died in March 2022 at the age of 33 after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour. Singer Olly Murs, who starred on The X Factor a year before One Direction, said he was \u201clost for words\u201d, describing Payne\u2019s death as \u201cdevastating\u201d on Instagram. Murs wrote beside a picture of the pair: We always had a good laugh when we saw each other, sometimes the catch ups were only short and sweet but when we did it was mostly about how annoyingly good his hair always looked, or our love for Becks, the old XF (X Factor) days and the tour we shared together,\u201d Murs wrote beside a picture of the pair. Liam shared the same passions as me, the same dreams so to see his life now end so young hits hard, I\u2019m truly gutted and devastated for his family and of course his son Bear losing a dad. A life in pictures \u2013 see here: After One Direction, Liam Payne was just getting started, writes Alexis Petridis. If a quarter of a century of reality TV talent shows has taught us anything, it\u2019s that success in them is seldom a guarantee of lasting fame: more often than not, the celebrity is fleeting, and confined to the country of the show\u2019s origin. You might have predicted that outcome for One Direction. Simon Cowell claimed to have thrown the band together \u201cin 10 minutes\u201d from solo contestants who had failed to progress any further than the bootcamp stage of the 2010 UK X Factor \u2013 despite the fact that one of them, the Wolverhampton-born Liam Payne, had at one stage been tipped to win the series for his initial audition: a version of the old standard Cry Me A River. One Direction ended the series as runners-up, and that, you could have assumed, was that \u2013 after all, the stock of the boyband was hopelessly low at the time. But things didn\u2019t work out that way at all. One Direction ended up being one of the definitive pop bands of their era, shifting 70m records, and becoming the first band in the history of the US Billboard chart to see their first four albums debut at No 1. On the most basic level, they were successful because they were talented, charismatic and good looking and, more importantly, because a little more effort seemed to go into their singles from the off. Their debut, What Makes You Beautiful, was infernally catchy; it addressed their female fans with a charming positivity and was rooted in a glossy take on powerpop rather the standard boyband approach of ballad or pop-R&amp;B. \u201cWhen we heard it,\u201d Payne noted, \u201cit wasn\u2019t what we expected \u2026 so it kind of fitted perfectly.\u201d Read more: Here is a link to the Guardian\u2019s story on Liam Payne\u2019s death. TV presenter Dermot O\u2019Leary has recalled Liam Payne auditioning for The X Factor as a 14-year-old boy, as he paid tribute to the singer following his death. O\u2019Leary, who hosted The X Factor during both of Payne\u2019s appearances, shared a photograph of the pair on stage, captioning the Instagram post: \u201cThe worst news\u201d. He wrote: I remember him as a 14-year-old turning up to audition on The X Factor, and blowing us away singing Sinatra. He just loved to sing. He was always a joy, had time for everyone, polite, grateful, and was always humble. Payne had been visiting Argentina along with his former bandmate Niall Horan, who performed at the city\u2019s Movistar Arena on 2 October. Payne was seen dancing and singing along with Horan\u2019s fans at the concert. Hundreds of fans gathered outside the hotel on Wednesday evening, where police sectioned off the entrance with tape. A quiet disbelief hung over the street. Supporters stood in shock, many of them in tears as they consoled one another. Others stared up at the hotel, of which all the curtains were closed. \u201cI\u2019m feeling heartbroken. I remember when I was a kid I had a lot of bullying in my school and his songs helped. I\u2019m devastated. I came as soon as I heard the news,\u201d said 26-year-old fan Martina Belaustgui. \u201cI saw him at Niall\u2019s show a few weeks ago. He was singing and dancing and jumping.\u201d \u201cI met him when I was 12. He was with his family and I asked for a picture. He was so nice. I was so shy, he tried to talk to me but I couldn\u2019t say anything. I regret that,\u201d said 25-year-old fan Mariana Pinto. Liam Payne, a former member of the boyband One Direction, has died aged 31 after falling from a third-floor hotel room in Buenos Aires, police have confirmed. The singer died on Wednesday at 5pm local time. \u201cLiam James Payne, composer and guitarist, former member of the band One Direction, died today after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Palermo,\u201d Buenos Aires police said in a statement. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, told Argentina\u2019s Todo Noticias TV channel that Payne had fallen into an internal courtyard at the hotel. Candles, tears and applause in Buenos Aires as One Direction fans say farewell to Liam Payne \u201cA few minutes later [an] emergency team arrived and confirmed the death of this man who we later learned was from a musical group. He had injuries incompatible with life as a result of his fall. There was no way to do anything,\u201d Crescenti said. Crescenti said authorities were investigating the circumstances of Payne\u2019s death and conducting an autopsy. In a statement on Wednesday, the police said they had gone to the hotel after being notified of an \u201caggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol\u201d, according to Reuters. The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.",

While the EU and its member states have publicly discussed offering asylum to Russian deserters, no decision has been reached and it has proven difficult for deserters to get asylum.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time an EU country let in a group of deserters who did not have any travel documents or foreign passports,\u201d said Ivan Chuviliaev, spokesperson of the Go By The Forest, a group helping Russian soldiers desert who worked on the case involving the six soldiers.</p> <p>Unable to travel to Europe and facing the prospect of long-term imprisonment at home, most deserters fled to countries bordering Russia, such as Armenia and Kazakhstan, where they could enter without a passport but remained trapped without an option to travel onward.</p> <p>Moscow has gone to great lengths to track them down. There has been a growing number of incidents where deserters hiding in post-Soviet countries within reach of the Kremlin have been kidnapped or deported back to Russia. Their precarious situation has prompted louder calls from anti-war activists to provide soldiers with a safe haven by allowing them to seek refuge in the west.</p> <p>\u201cIn Kazakhstan, you can never feel safe; you just have to keep your head down,\u201d said Alexander, who described living without a SIM card or bank account to avoid being tracked by Russia. From Kazakhstan, Alexander started running an anonymous YouTube channel calling on other soldiers to desert.</p> <p>Anti-war advocates like Chuviliaev now believe that France\u2019s willingness to admit deserters could set a precedent and send a strong signal to other western nations, potentially accelerating the process.</p> <p>\u201cFrance\u2019s decision is the result of extensive collaboration between French authorities and a group of human rights organisations,\u201d said Chuviliaev, whose organisation has helped over 2,000 soldiers to flee abroad.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope this marks the beginning of more deserters being let into Europe,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Chuviliaev said that each of the deserters was meticulously vetted for months for their \u201cstrong, consistent anti-war stance\u201d before being let into France.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand that there are fears in the west that some might not be who they say they are,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Among those granted temporary entry permits were men who fought in the war against Ukraine, as well as conscripts and officers who managed to avoid being sent to the front lines.</p> <p>Chuviliaev believed that their arrival in France could serve as an incentive for other Russians to desert the army.</p> <p>\u201cFor someone contemplating desertion, it is crucial to envision a future in a free country rather than facing jail or a precarious existence in a nation bordering Russia, living in constant fear of deportation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Kremlin has recently stepped up its efforts to clamp down on desertion, hunting down and jailing soldiers at home and abroad as it looks to meet its constant need for manpower in Ukraine. To dissuade deserting, Putin has signed a series of laws toughening punishments, including prison sentences of up to 15 years and the confiscation of the property of fleeing soldiers.</p> <p>There have also been widespread media reports and personal accounts of so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-soldiers-punished-refusing-fight-ukraine/32505035.html\">holes</a> <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-soldiers-punished-refusing-fight-ukraine/32505035.html\">and pits</a>\u201d, basements where officers and regular soldiers are held for days against their will for refusing to fight.</p> <p>The independent news outlet Mediazone has reported that authorities have initiated at least 7,400 cases in the last two years against Russian soldiers accused of abandoning their units without leave. The real numbers are likely to be greater given the Kremlin\u2019s systematic attempts to hide information about the military.</p> <p>Russia has also pursued deserters hiding abroad, pressuring countries in its geopolitical orbit to hand over Russian deserters. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.</p> <p>Some deserters suffered worse outcomes. In February, Maksim Kuzminov, a Russian pilot who had defected to Ukraine, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/19/russian-helicopter-pilot-defected-found-dead-spain-says-ukraine-security-agency\">gunned</a> down outside his apartment in the beach town of Alicante in Spain where he was residing, in an operation widely attributed to Russia\u2019s intelligence services.</p> <p>Aware of how far Russia is willing to go to punish deserters, Alexander expressed his hope to help more former soldiers relocate to the west.</p> <p>\u201cI know what those guys are going through. We can\u2019t let them down.\u201d</p>",

Unable to travel to Europe and facing the prospect of long-term imprisonment at home, most deserters fled to countries bordering Russia, such as Armenia and Kazakhstan, where they could enter without a passport but remained trapped without an option to travel onward. Moscow has gone to great lengths to track them down. There has been a growing number of incidents where deserters hiding in post-Soviet countries within reach of the Kremlin have been kidnapped or deported back to Russia. Their precarious situation has prompted louder calls from anti-war activists to provide soldiers with a safe haven by allowing them to seek refuge in the west. \u201cIn Kazakhstan, you can never feel safe; you just have to keep your head down,\u201d said Alexander, who described living without a SIM card or bank account to avoid being tracked by Russia. From Kazakhstan, Alexander started running an anonymous YouTube channel calling on other soldiers to desert. Anti-war advocates like Chuviliaev now believe that France\u2019s willingness to admit deserters could set a precedent and send a strong signal to other western nations, potentially accelerating the process. \u201cFrance\u2019s decision is the result of extensive collaboration between French authorities and a group of human rights organisations,\u201d said Chuviliaev, whose organisation has helped over 2,000 soldiers to flee abroad. \u201cWe hope this marks the beginning of more deserters being let into Europe,\u201d he added. Chuviliaev said that each of the deserters was meticulously vetted for months for their \u201cstrong, consistent anti-war stance\u201d before being let into France. \u201cWe understand that there are fears in the west that some might not be who they say they are,\u201d he said. Among those granted temporary entry permits were men who fought in the war against Ukraine, as well as conscripts and officers who managed to avoid being sent to the front lines. Chuviliaev believed that their arrival in France could serve as an incentive for other Russians to desert the army. \u201cFor someone contemplating desertion, it is crucial to envision a future in a free country rather than facing jail or a precarious existence in a nation bordering Russia, living in constant fear of deportation,\u201d he said. The Kremlin has recently stepped up its efforts to clamp down on desertion, hunting down and jailing soldiers at home and abroad as it looks to meet its constant need for manpower in Ukraine. To dissuade deserting, Putin has signed a series of laws toughening punishments, including prison sentences of up to 15 years and the confiscation of the property of fleeing soldiers. There have also been widespread media reports and personal accounts of so-called \u201choles and pits\u201d, basements where officers and regular soldiers are held for days against their will for refusing to fight. The independent news outlet Mediazone has reported that authorities have initiated at least 7,400 cases in the last two years against Russian soldiers accused of abandoning their units without leave. The real numbers are likely to be greater given the Kremlin\u2019s systematic attempts to hide information about the military. Russia has also pursued deserters hiding abroad, pressuring countries in its geopolitical orbit to hand over Russian deserters. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison. Some deserters suffered worse outcomes. In February, Maksim Kuzminov, a Russian pilot who had defected to Ukraine, was gunned down outside his apartment in the beach town of Alicante in Spain where he was residing, in an operation widely attributed to Russia\u2019s intelligence services. Aware of how far Russia is willing to go to punish deserters, Alexander expressed his hope to help more former soldiers relocate to the west. \u201cI know what those guys are going through. We can\u2019t let them down.\u201d",

The process is a collaboration, with input from the business on the modules and the style of delivery, such as whether teaching is remote or in person, and on which days of the week \u2013 \u201ceven down to the granular level of what examples would be most relevant to your staff,\u201d says Harvey-Brewin. Businesses can be as involved as they\u2019d like, with the University of Greenwich taking on the onerous administration work \u2013 the university will set up meetings as they\u2019re writing the content for the programme, so there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for partners to offer feedback and redirection. Finally, the University of Greenwich helps businesses they\u2019re collaborating with to find the right apprentices. \u201cWe work with line managers in identifying which members of staff they want to take, or in some cases we even help craft job descriptions,\u201d says Harvey-Brewin. The university manages all of the paperwork in terms of the initial assessment, training plans and the framework agreement. Harvey-Brewin\u2019s team also organises inductions to make sure both the employer and apprentice understand what they\u2019re getting themselves into and to make sure everyone is fully prepared for the programme. Most of the University of Greenwich\u2019s apprenticeships are in construction, healthcare, science and engineering, and the university has long-standing partnerships with businesses in these industries. \u201cA lot of the teachers delivering the content are either in practice or have recently come out of practice,\u201d says Harvey-Brewin. \u201cOur campus in Kent is also really close to a lot of business parks, particularly in science and engineering.\u201d The university is particularly well placed to partner with businesses. \u201cWe have a strong track record as a vocation-centred university, helping students develop the skills to solve real-world problems,\u201d says Harvey-Brewin. \u201cWorkplace learning and vocational education is very deeply embedded into [our] culture.\u201d For businesses that partner with the University of Greenwich, the institution\u2019s heritage, values and approach to teaching means that they can enjoy the benefits of apprenticeships without having to manage every detail themselves. Here\u2019s what some of the employers who have already worked with the university have to say \u2026 Partners in apprenticeship excellence \u201cWe have a very good working relationship with the University of Greenwich,\u201d says Nigel Hogg, trust-wide lead on apprenticeships at Oxleas NHS foundation trust. \u201cTheir team consults with us on curriculum design, and we get both corporate and individual feedback on how our apprentices are progressing. They try to make sure all of our staff members do the best they can, and help them to complete their apprenticeships successfully wherever possible.\u201d Keeping up with an ever-evolving industry \u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve found that keeping fresh talent coming through our business is key to our ongoing success. Without good apprentices coming through our business, our teams would not be able to grow,\u201d says Matthew Brunt, commercial director at Stanmore Contractors Limited. \u201cOur industry evolves constantly, just like the degree apprenticeships our staff undertake at the University of Greenwich. These programmes help ensure that we can continue to provide the best service to our clients.\u201d Futureproofing your organisation \u201cApprenticeships allow us to futureproof our business. So take some time to think about where you want your business to be in the future, and what kind of people you need to take you there. Imagine the difference you could make by taking on staff that are keen and enthusiastic, and then giving them the space and support to develop and succeed,\u201d says Steven Huggett, commercial manager at United Living Group. \u201cWe have regular meetings with the university, and we always get good feedback on how our apprentices are progressing. It\u2019s a really easy process.\u201d Take your next step to business success. Begin your apprenticeship journey with the University of Greenwich. Visit gre.ac.uk/apprenticeships",

This was the pattern described time and time again by patients to Dr Nizam Mamode, a retired British surgeon who recently came back from working at the ravaged Nasser hospital in Gaza. Mamode, who went to Gaza with Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), has worked in many war zones throughout his career. He\u2019s been in Lebanon, Rwanda during the genocide, Sudan, Nicaragua. But, during a recent phone call, he told me what numerous other doctors have told numerous other media outlets: he\u2019s never seen anything like Gaza.</p> <p>The scale of civilian injuries, Mamode told me, was unprecedented. \u201cPretty much every day we\u2019d have one or two mass casualty incidents and there would be 10-20 dead, 20-40 seriously injured \u2026 the majority of those were women and children, perhaps 60 to 70%.\u201d These were mainly people, I want to stress, who were in areas that Israel had deemed safe. \u201cThe so-called humanitarian zone \u2013 I can\u2019t even bring myself to call it the safe zone,\u201d Mamode says. \u201cSo that green zone, you\u2019ve got about a million, million and a half people crammed into that area. Many of them are in so-called tents. The tents are often just bits of plastic stuck on poles.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/06/israeli-podcasters-laughing-gaza-genocide-two-nice-jewish-boys\">Israeli podcasters are laughing about genocide. What would it take to stop? | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What Dr Mamode is saying is not new; there have been a lot of harrowing accounts from doctors who have come back from Gaza. In April, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/02/gaza-palestinian-children-killed-idf-israel-war\">Guardian published a report</a> based on testimony from nine doctors, all but one of them foreign volunteers, along with eyewitness accounts which \u201cappear to back up claims that Israeli soldiers have fired on civilians\u201d.</p> <p>Still, while there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/07/postapocalyptic-uk-volunteer-surgeons-reflect-on-time-in-gaza\">plenty</a> of these accounts out there, I called Mamode because some of the <a href=\"https://x.com/AymanMSNBC/status/1843081357599068267\">quotes</a> I have read \u2013 stories of kids \u201cshot perfectly in the temple\u201d \u2013 are so disturbing that I just needed to hear them first-hand. I needed to ensure there wasn\u2019t some mysterious nuance I was missing.</p> <p>I also needed to understand why these stories don\u2019t seem to be making any difference. What these doctors are saying should stop every normal human being in their tracks. They should keep you up at night; make you want to drop everything you are doing in order to stop the mass extermination that is unfolding in Gaza. And yet, testimony from scores of international doctors, some of which has been <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/186664/joe-biden-health-workers-letter-gaza\">addressed directly</a> to the Biden administration, seems to fall on deaf ears. The unconditional aid to Israel keeps flowing. Excuses for Israel\u2019s genocidal violence keep coming. It\u2019s self-defence, we are told. Israel has a right to self-defence.</p> <p>Tell me: is this self-defence? One day, Mamode had to operate on a seven-year-old boy who was able to give a description of what happened to him. \u201cHe was knocked over by the blast from a bomb and was lying on the floor, heard this noise, looked up, there was a drone, and the drone fired at him. It caused severe injury to his chest and abdomen, his liver and spleen were damaged, his bowel was damaged and part of his stomach was hanging out of his chest. We heard descriptions like this over and over again. So it\u2019s not just one maverick drone operator who may have gone a bit crazy. This was persistent.\u201d</p> <p>Bombs and drones aren\u2019t the only killing machines in Gaza. There\u2019s also disease and starvation: both caused by the cramped and unsanitary conditions along with Israel blocking medical supplies and food from entering the strip.</p> <p>\u201c[Israel] expressly forbade us from taking in anything that wasn\u2019t for our personal use, even though we could easily have carried in medicines and equipment,\u201d Mamode says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a change because people who\u2019d been with MAP earlier in the year had been able to take in some external fixators to treat fractures. Now they\u2019re severely restricting medical supplies. When you cross into Gaza from Kerem Shalom, you see the tarmac covered for a long way \u2013 a kilometer probably \u2013 with supplies just lying on the tarmac. Even things like soap and shampoo are not allowed.\u201d<br><br>Has Mamode ever seen anything like this, I ask again? He has worked in multiple conflict areas. Has he ever seen these kinds of restrictions?</p> <p>\u201cNever,\u201d he says. \u201cI have never seen medical supplies being restricted in this way. I\u2019ve never seen people not being allowed to leave so that they\u2019re crammed into this tiny space and they can\u2019t get out. I\u2019ve never seen persistent targeting of civilians, and I\u2019ve never seen such persistent, deliberate targeting of aid workers, including healthcare workers.\u201d</p> <p>I want to be very clear here: aid workers do not operate haphazardly in Gaza \u2013 or anywhere else for that matter. They agree on their routes with the IDF. The leader of aid convoys is in close radio contact with the IDF. They get clearance to proceed. They share maps. They get the IDF to agree that they will not bomb certain safe houses. They take every possible precaution.</p> <p>And yet, they still get shot at. While Mamode was in Gaza one of the ambulances from his hospital went to the site of a bombing and received four shots in the windscreen. \u201cThe fact that that convoy was shot at by the IDF is simply, in my view, to say to aid workers: \u2018Think twice about coming here,\u2019\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that. Certainly aid workers and healthcare staff in other conflicts sometimes get injured and or killed inadvertently. But I think in this conflict, they\u2019ve been deliberately targeted. And that\u2019s shocking.\u201d</p> <p>There is this famous quote attributed to the journalism professor Jonathan Foster that regularly does the rounds on social media: \u201cIf someone says it\u2019s raining, and another person says it\u2019s dry, it\u2019s not your job to quote them both. Your job is to look out the fucking window and find out which is true.\u201d</p> <p>The problem with Gaza is that it is not easy to look out of the window because it has been barricaded shut. <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/2024-09-11/ty-article-opinion/israel-must-allow-foreign-journalists-to-report-from-gaza/00000191-dd73-dd31-a9bd-ff779bf20000\">Foreign journalists</a> are not allowed in Gaza unless they are on IDF propaganda trips.

Abroad, there are just 15 Americans on the 18 World Tour teams, the lowest number since 2008.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/13/katie-archibald-my-job-satisfaction-is-a-10-the-rest-of-my-life-is-definitely-not\">Katie Archibald: \u2018My job satisfaction is a 10. The rest of my life is definitely not\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With road riding in the doldrums, gravel has filled the void, galvanized by individuals like Stetina. These riders, known as privateers, essentially are one-person teams with the autonomy to pick their sponsors and schedule. The privateer model runs in stark contrast to the rigidity of the World Tour, in which team managers decide everything for riders, including team roles, races, and salaries.</p> <p>Already on an upward trajectory in 2020, gravel has boomed in the years after the pandemic, because it offers an escape from everyday life and a safe way to get outside. Gravel bike sales doubled in 2020 and again in 2021. Three years on, gravel continues to grow at a rapid rate. Data from Strava shows gravel rides were up 55% in 2023, the fastest rise in activity on the app.</p> <p>Over the same period, the sharp end of the sport has consolidated around the <a href=\"https://www.lifetimegrandprix.com/\">LifeTime Grand Prix</a>, a seven-race series regarded as the premier offroad circuit in the world. The Grand Prix attracts a mix of riders and offers a $300,000 purse, split between the top 10 men and women. The elite field is a mix of ex-World Tour, cyclocross, and pro mountain bikers, as well as newcomers from the junior ranks.</p> <p>While road and gravel bikes look similar, their cultures are radically different. Road is synonymous with Lycra, skinny tires, and deep tradition. The sport\u2019s flagship events \u2013 the five Monuments and three Grand Tours \u2013 are steeped in European history. Gravel, on the other hand, is new, unorthodox, and exploratory, making it perfect for the US, a country where a quarter of the roads are unpaved and rarely trafficked.</p> <p>\u201cRoad cycling is a tradition-bound sport,\u201d says Payson McElveen, a two-time national mountain bike champion who sits third on the Grand Prix standings. \u201cEverything runs through the World Tour teams, which have been doing the same things for decades, like how they market their athletes. Gravel races forbid team tactics, which opens the door for more creativity and storytelling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a privateer, I have the latitude to express myself and take on projects that I\u2019m excited about,\u201d says McElveen, who has cultivated a large community around his podcast, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-adventure-stache/id1459162520\">The Adventure Stache</a>, as well as a series of adventure films with his major sponsors, including Red Bull. \u201cAthletes are meant to inspire, which isn\u2019t just on race day. Your passion and enthusiasm is a big part of your career.\u201d</p> <p>Privateering comes with a unique set of challenges though. Riders need to be organized, logistically savvy, and good relationship builders. Without a team manager, they must plan all their travel, manage social media, negotiate contracts, hire mechanics, and attend sponsor obligations, while keeping a rigorous training schedule.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a constant game of prioritization,\u201d says Stetina, \u201cand the biggest challenge is managing your time.\u201d Juggling responsibilities isn\u2019t for everyone, yet a growing number of riders are eschewing teams for the freedom that comes with privateering \u2013 and the opportunity to make more money.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said compensation wasn\u2019t a big part of it,\u201d says McElveen, \u201cthere\u2019s no ceiling to what you can make, unlike the World Tour.\u201d McElveen estimates that around half of the 60 riders in the Grand Prix are privateers, with varying levels of success among them.</p> <p>Alexey Vermeulen, who rode for LottoNL-Jumbo (now Visma-Lease a Bike) early in his career, now earns six figures as a privateer, considerably more than he did on the World Tour. At 15, Vermeulen moved to Europe to chase the dream of riding in the pro peleton. On track to become America\u2019s next great general classification rider, he was let go in 2019 due to what he says were team politics. Instead of searching for a new World Tour team, Vermeulen pivoted to gravel.</p>    <p>In his first season, Vermeulen barely broke even, despite living rent free with his parents. \u201cGetting in is a challenge. It\u2019s a big bet on yourself,\u201d says Vermeulen, who spent two seasons fighting for sponsorships from marquee brands. The risk paid off eventually, as Vermeulen placed second overall in both 2022 and 2023, and has had the same group of primary sponsors for the last four years.</p> <p>\u201cI miss the history and romance of the World Tour, but my personality is a better fit for privateering. I\u2019m OCD about lists, I\u2019m outgoing, and I\u2019m good at telling a story\u201d says Vermeulen, who thinks of himself as more of an entrepreneur than a bike racer. Winning races is only a part of the formula. \u201cThe biggest challenge is balancing films and projects with consistent training.\u201d</p> <p>Vermeulen produces a popular YouTube series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=JqhhadyMntk\">starring his dog, Sir Willie the Wiener</a>, riding on his back. Clips of Vermeulen and Willie have gone viral on social media, helping him \u2013 and his main sponsors \u2013 gain more visibility around the industry. \u201cAs a rider, you\u2019re not just a billboard or a race result. It\u2019s a collaboration between you and the brand to tell a real story.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah Sturm, a two-time Cyclocross National Champion, found early success when she switched to gravel racing. After her cyclocross team folded in 2018, she won her first race, the BWR. This win plus two other podiums in her first season put Sturm on a rapid ascent to gravel stardom.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I saw the amount of sponsorship offers that came in after the BWR win, I realized it was a different ballgame,\u201d says Sturm. \u201cThe sport has grown a lot since then, but it\u2019s still the wild west of bike racing. There is a lot of freedom and a lot of money, but you also have to manage it all by yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Sturm finished third overall in 2022 and fourth in 2023, but says that most of her personal brand was built off the bike. Using her background in marketing, she picked up the business side of privateering quickly and built an impressive roster of clients, making her one of the highest earning athletes in the sport.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you win every race by a mile, you need more than just results,\u201d says Sturm. \u201cBrands don\u2019t care if you place second or fifth or 10th. What matters is your personality. You have to be good at selling yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Sturm has appeared in films, articles, panels, and at major events, which has made her one of the best known faces in the sport. This, she says, is what differentiates a successful privateer, estimating that about 15 riders on the Grand Prix have made substantial money going solo.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an agent because that doesn\u2019t work for me,\u201d says Sturm, who believes the constant emails and personal connections with brands pay off in the long run. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from others like Pete, Payson, and Alexey. We all talk a lot behind the scenes, mostly about the business side of it.\u201d</p> <p>Despite appearing individualistic, almost every privateer has a large support network behind them. \u201cThe privateer model is new to cycling, but it\u2019s been around in sports like golf and surfing for a long time,\u201d says Hannah Otto, a Tokyo Olympian and Mountain Bike World Cup winner who spent nine years on various teams before becoming a privateer in 2022. \u201cThe real secret is having the right team behind you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople would be shocked if they saw my taxes and knew how many people I hire just to race bikes,\u201d says Otto, who pays a coach, sports psychologist, physio, nutritionist, agent, accountant, and mechanic to support her career. \u201cThis lets me focus on my strengths. For example, my agent does negotiations and invoicing, so I can focus on big ideas and creating value for my sponsors.\u201d</p> <p>After winning Leadville 100, one of the most prestigious offroad races in the US, Otto saw her earnings grow quickly. \u201cWinning a big race changes the math,\u201d Otto says. \u201cI\u2019m now making a lot more than I was on a factory team and feel more secure than ever. My salary is diversified across many brands, but if you\u2019re on a team and they have a bad year, that has huge consequences.\u201d</p> <p>On a macro level, privateers are a perfect product-market fit with America. The European way of doing business doesn\u2019t work in a country built around entrepreneurial, creative, and individual ethos. Until recently, American cycling lost the plot. Privateers reignited the country\u2019s love of cycling.</p> <p>\u201cThe world is watching American cycling closer than they have in decades,\u201d says McElveen. \u201cEven in Europe, riders are talking about the Grand Prix. Everyone knows about gravel and is curious to see if privateers will make an impact on other parts of the sport, like the World Tour.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>A warrior and her wolf are running through perspective-shifting collages of the most sumptuous nature scenes I\u2019ve ever seen in a video game. Cranes flit from shining pools, boar and stags roam in the background; as the camera zooms out on the plain, yellow flowers extending off on all sides, a cleaved mountain comes into view in the distance. But there is a corrupting force at work. Here birds fall from the sky, black flowers blooming from their tiny bodies. Formless masked demons emerge from the ground to feast on them. These are your enemies, vanquished with a thin blade drawn from your warrior\u2019s side. But there are so many of them \u2013 and you\u2019re just one human, and a wolf.</p> <p>Neva does not embellish this setup with words. You never find out what led to this corruption, or why you alone are fighting it. It tells its story with extraordinary visuals and elegant animation from developer Nomada Studio, in concert with chest-tighteningly effective music from Barcelona-based Berlinist. Many games that achieve this level of beauty suffer a little for prioritising style over substance, but Neva hits home on all levels.

      "bodyText": "A warrior and her wolf are running through perspective-shifting collages of the most sumptuous nature scenes I\u2019ve ever seen in a video game. Cranes flit from shining pools, boar and stags roam in the background; as the camera zooms out on the plain, yellow flowers extending off on all sides, a cleaved mountain comes into view in the distance. But there is a corrupting force at work. Here birds fall from the sky, black flowers blooming from their tiny bodies. Formless masked demons emerge from the ground to feast on them. These are your enemies, vanquished with a thin blade drawn from your warrior\u2019s side. But there are so many of them \u2013 and you\u2019re just one human, and a wolf. Neva does not embellish this setup with words. You never find out what led to this corruption, or why you alone are fighting it. It tells its story with extraordinary visuals and elegant animation from developer Nomada Studio, in concert with chest-tighteningly effective music from Barcelona-based Berlinist. Many games that achieve this level of beauty suffer a little for prioritising style over substance, but Neva hits home on all levels.

Asked whether she knew of any colleagues who declined free tickets to see Swift, the education secretary told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \u201cI don\u2019t.

On Wednesday Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, became the sixth cabinet minister to declare he had accepted free Swift tickets this summer. He made the disclosure in the latest parliamentary register of interests. Ministers have faced questions over the extra security granted to the megastar during her stay in London, which included a blue-light escort usually reserved for royalty and senior politicians. It has emerged that senior politicians and officials spoke to the Metropolitan police after the force refused Swift\u2019s request for extra security, made after she cancelled a series of concerts in Vienna because of a foiled terror plot. Despite the Met\u2019s initial reservations, the pop star was escorted by a motorcycle convoy to and from Wembley. The government has insisted that the police force took its decision independently. It also emerged this week that Keir Starmer met Swift and her mother after attending one of her concerts days after a decision was taken to grant her a blue-light escort. Downing Street has said there is no conflict of interest and that the matter would not be referred to the prime minister\u2019s independent ethics adviser. Asked whether there was a potential conflict in ministers accepting freebies, Phillipson told the Today programme: \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure, in the case that you\u2019re describing, how a conflict of interest would arise, but I am aware, as a member of the Cabinet, that it is important I follow everything that\u2019s asked of me in terms of declarations both as an MP, through the register of members\u2019 interests, but also my responsibilities under the ministerial code. \u201cAnd I do everything I can to make sure that I am respecting that, honouring that and fulfilling my obligations.\u201d",

The answer is this podcast, which sees amateur sleuth Lauren Kilby attempt to uncover the culprit of a defecation that occurred at her friends Karen and Helen\u2019s boat-based wedding.

      "body": "<p>Alvin Ailey was a momentous figure in American dance. One of his most substantial and lasting achievements was to transform ideas of what a modern dance company could be, collapsing distinctions between diverse worlds like concert dance, jazz and Hollywood entertainment. He was also a transformational figure for the Black community: the dance institutions that he built in his lifetime \u2013 the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center \u2013 have cultivated generations of Black dance talent while sharing the experience of Black people in America.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/16/alvin-ailey-american-dance-theater-revelations-interviews\">\u2018I was flabbergasted by the sight\u2019: Alvin Ailey dancers on their legendary Revelations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ailey\u2019s creative roots go back to his childhood in rural Texas in the 1930s, where he faced racism and segregation, and stood alongside his mother in the cotton fields. He discovered dance as a teenager, and while he was coming of age he even briefly had a nightclub act in San Francisco with the writer and activist Maya Angelou. Ailey\u2019s art was also deeply impacted by his identity as a gay Black man, although his sexuality remained largely hidden during his lifetime. Throughout his career he would also draw from other geographies and traditions, such as West Africa and the Caribbean, and this mixture of elements led to a unique figure who gave something special to the world of dance.</p> <p>Ailey receives a show worthy of his greatness in Edges of Ailey \u2013 a massive enterprise that took six years to curate and which now fills 18,000 sq ft of the Whitney Museum\u2019s fifth floor. With contributions from over 80 artists, a deep look into Ailey\u2019s personal journals and archives, and an ambitious schedule of associated events and performances, Edges of Ailey is easily one of the biggest exhibitions that has ever graced the Whitney\u2019s galleries.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m shocked that he has not already received treatment like this, given his importance to dance,\u201d the show\u2019s curator and art scholar Adrienne Edwards told me while discussing Edges of Ailey. \u201cWe\u2019ve had shows about [George] Balanchine, one about Lincoln Kirstein from the ballet perspective, lots of shows about artists like Merce Cunningham, Trisha Brown, Yvonne Rainer \u2026 that\u2019s great and they all deserve shows, but I was very struck by the fact that Ailey had never received one.\u201d</p>    <p>In part an effort to re-introduce Ailey to the public \u2013 showing new sides of him that have not typically been know to the world at large \u2013 Edges of Ailey goes deep into the dancer\u2019s personal archives to provide an intimate look at the icon. In curating the show, Edwards saw her work as an opportunity to better know an individual that she has been fascinated by for her entire life. \u201cI was really interested in who was this man who started this thing,\u201d said Edwards, \u201cand what was his trajectory, what were his curiosities, what was the way in which he worked?\u201d</p> <p>In answering these questions, Edwards found Ailey\u2019s notebooks of particular use. She had initially approached the material surrounding Ailey as a researcher, hoping to simply understand his art more deeply, but she was surprised to discover a very intimate encounter with the human being behind the great artist. Edwards soon realized that Ailey had purposely saved all of these materials and made them available so that future generations could continue to engage with him and his creativity on these more personal levels. \u201cIt was really profound to be like, \u2018he did this for a reason,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was waiting for someone to come around and share it with the world. I feel like Ailey gave us so many gifts. I wanted to meet his generosity, and I was so grateful that he left those notebooks.\u201d</p> <p>In bringing these archives to the public, Edges of Ailey allows us to see the dancer\u2019s complexities as a person, as well as the incredibly diverse interests that encompassed his mind. Audiences now have the opportunity to see how Ailey worked, taking ideas and slowly elaborating them over time. His intellectual life is further demonstrated through correspondence with luminaries like Langston Hughes, as well as creative inspirations like James Baldwin and Duke Ellington.</p>    <p>The exhibition also brings out the many struggles that Ailey had to overcome in order to be a success. Living as a gay Black man in an America that was extremely unsafe for him, Ailey had to rely on cruising in order to have a sexual life. It was another way he had to fight for his liberation, both as a creative artist and as a human being.</p> <p>Additionally, these personal writings provide ample demonstration of how very much Ailey loved his dancers. This love is often intertwined with the incredible sacrifices that he made in order to build up his dance company and sustain it through the decades. \u201cYou can see the ledgers where he lists the payments for dancers week to week,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cAnd when you look at his own name, there would be a zero.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most notable features of Edges of Ailey, referred to as \u201cthe surround\u201d, consists of some 18 video projections that mostly fill up the perimeter of the exhibition space, offering fascinating videos that, together, build up to a loosely chronological examination of Ailey\u2019s life.

      "bodyText": "Alvin Ailey was a momentous figure in American dance. One of his most substantial and lasting achievements was to transform ideas of what a modern dance company could be, collapsing distinctions between diverse worlds like concert dance, jazz and Hollywood entertainment. He was also a transformational figure for the Black community: the dance institutions that he built in his lifetime \u2013 the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center \u2013 have cultivated generations of Black dance talent while sharing the experience of Black people in America. Ailey\u2019s creative roots go back to his childhood in rural Texas in the 1930s, where he faced racism and segregation, and stood alongside his mother in the cotton fields. He discovered dance as a teenager, and while he was coming of age he even briefly had a nightclub act in San Francisco with the writer and activist Maya Angelou. Ailey\u2019s art was also deeply impacted by his identity as a gay Black man, although his sexuality remained largely hidden during his lifetime. Throughout his career he would also draw from other geographies and traditions, such as West Africa and the Caribbean, and this mixture of elements led to a unique figure who gave something special to the world of dance. Ailey receives a show worthy of his greatness in Edges of Ailey \u2013 a massive enterprise that took six years to curate and which now fills 18,000 sq ft of the Whitney Museum\u2019s fifth floor. With contributions from over 80 artists, a deep look into Ailey\u2019s personal journals and archives, and an ambitious schedule of associated events and performances, Edges of Ailey is easily one of the biggest exhibitions that has ever graced the Whitney\u2019s galleries. \u201cI\u2019m shocked that he has not already received treatment like this, given his importance to dance,\u201d the show\u2019s curator and art scholar Adrienne Edwards told me while discussing Edges of Ailey. \u201cWe\u2019ve had shows about [George] Balanchine, one about Lincoln Kirstein from the ballet perspective, lots of shows about artists like Merce Cunningham, Trisha Brown, Yvonne Rainer \u2026 that\u2019s great and they all deserve shows, but I was very struck by the fact that Ailey had never received one.\u201d In part an effort to re-introduce Ailey to the public \u2013 showing new sides of him that have not typically been know to the world at large \u2013 Edges of Ailey goes deep into the dancer\u2019s personal archives to provide an intimate look at the icon. In curating the show, Edwards saw her work as an opportunity to better know an individual that she has been fascinated by for her entire life. \u201cI was really interested in who was this man who started this thing,\u201d said Edwards, \u201cand what was his trajectory, what were his curiosities, what was the way in which he worked?\u201d In answering these questions, Edwards found Ailey\u2019s notebooks of particular use. She had initially approached the material surrounding Ailey as a researcher, hoping to simply understand his art more deeply, but she was surprised to discover a very intimate encounter with the human being behind the great artist. Edwards soon realized that Ailey had purposely saved all of these materials and made them available so that future generations could continue to engage with him and his creativity on these more personal levels. \u201cIt was really profound to be like, \u2018he did this for a reason,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was waiting for someone to come around and share it with the world. I feel like Ailey gave us so many gifts. I wanted to meet his generosity, and I was so grateful that he left those notebooks.\u201d In bringing these archives to the public, Edges of Ailey allows us to see the dancer\u2019s complexities as a person, as well as the incredibly diverse interests that encompassed his mind. Audiences now have the opportunity to see how Ailey worked, taking ideas and slowly elaborating them over time. His intellectual life is further demonstrated through correspondence with luminaries like Langston Hughes, as well as creative inspirations like James Baldwin and Duke Ellington. The exhibition also brings out the many struggles that Ailey had to overcome in order to be a success. Living as a gay Black man in an America that was extremely unsafe for him, Ailey had to rely on cruising in order to have a sexual life. It was another way he had to fight for his liberation, both as a creative artist and as a human being. Additionally, these personal writings provide ample demonstration of how very much Ailey loved his dancers. This love is often intertwined with the incredible sacrifices that he made in order to build up his dance company and sustain it through the decades. \u201cYou can see the ledgers where he lists the payments for dancers week to week,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cAnd when you look at his own name, there would be a zero.\u201d One of the most notable features of Edges of Ailey, referred to as \u201cthe surround\u201d, consists of some 18 video projections that mostly fill up the perimeter of the exhibition space, offering fascinating videos that, together, build up to a loosely chronological examination of Ailey\u2019s life. The idea for it came about as Edwards was examining Ailey\u2019s archives, astonished to discover nearly 200 videos of the artist that were made throughout his life. \u201cI realized there was an incredible amount of material there that we could use to visually tell the story,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cIt\u2019s this really poignant arc that takes you from his beginnings to his end.\u201d The surround includes recordings that Edwards and her team made while visiting Ailey\u2019s hometown of Rogers, Texas, situating the exhibition in the dancer\u2019s milieu. Other projections involve Ailey\u2019s two major influences, Katherine Dunham and Lester Horton, as well as performances of key dances from Ailey\u2019s choreography. There are also extremely touching messages recorded for Ailey by his dancers to bring him hope and strength while he was hospitalized for complications from the HIV infection that ultimately ended his life. Ultimately, Edwards sees Edges of Ailey as a show that gestures toward the future \u2013 in helping audiences to better understand its subject, future generations can be informed, and continue to be inspired. \u201cWe often think of archives as being about the past, about what has been, but the archives are actually for the future,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIn some ways the show is a thank you to him, even though he\u2019s not here to see it. It\u2019s to acknowledge and to understand who he was and what he made.\u201d Edges of Ailey is on display at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York until 9 February 2025",

      "body": "<p>In a development that will only come as a shock to newborns and extraterrestrials, Lionel Messi\u2019s MLS performances have been absolutely stellar this season. He has been a key part of the Inter Miami team at the top of the standings, has produced all manner of goals and assists, and has generally lived up to the hype every time he has stepped on the field.</p> <p>It\u2019s slightly more surprising that if his spectacular run ends with winning MLS\u2019s Most Valuable Player award (MVP), it would be unprecedented in North American men\u2019s sports and nearly unheard of in the most famous domestic men\u2019s leagues in Europe \u2013 with one very notable exception.</p> <p>At time of writing, Messi ranks fifth in the MLS goalscoring leaderboard with 17 and sixth in assists with 11, giving him 28 total goal contributions, good for third in the league. Those numbers are solid but hardly the stuff of a no-doubt MVP. And they aren\u2019t notable by Messi\u2019s astronomic standards.</p> <p>That is, until you consider that he has achieved those numbers in just 18 appearances. That low total is due to a long layoff after an ankle injury suffered during the Copa Am\u00e9rica, which kept him sidelined for months. Messi\u2019s total number of appearances will finalize at 19 assuming he plays in the regular-season finale on Saturday. He may add some goals and assists in that last game before the playoffs, but it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll finish the season leading the league in those categories.</p> <p>On a per-90 minute basis, though, Messi<em> is</em> leading the league in goals, assists, and the combination of the two. He is also overperforming the expected versions of those statistics according to FBref \u2013 in other words, he is finishing difficult chances at a high rate, and consistently delivering assists to his teammates in unlikely situations.</p> <p>These rough \u201cper game\u201d numbers stand out even in the context of Messi\u2019s glittering career: The only two domestic league seasons in which he boasted more goal contributions per 90 minutes than 2024 are two from his peak at Barcelona \u2013 2011-12, in which he notched 66 goal contributions in 37 games for an average of 1.94 per 90, and the following season, where he contributed 57 goals plus assists for an average of 1.82. With Inter Miami this season, Messi is hitting 1.73 goal contributions a game.</p>    <p>Just as Barcelona and PSG, Inter Miami are reaping the benefits, clinching the Supporters\u2019 Shield for the best regular-season record in the league a few weeks ago. With a win in Saturday\u2019s finale, Miami would set a new MLS record for points in a single season.</p> <p>There are plenty of other solid candidates for the 2024 MLS MVP though. Cucho Hern\u00e1ndez has been the attacking talisman for the Columbus Crew, as has Luciano Acosta for an FC Cincinnati side that looks much different than it did a year ago. Christian Benteke will almost certainly win the Golden Boot, which automatically puts him in the MVP conversation. LAFC\u2019s Denis Bouanga has been as devastating on the dribble as he is in front of goal, and Messi\u2019s teammate Luis Su\u00e1rez has also been instrumental in Miami\u2019s success with his team-leading (for now) goal tally.</p> <p>Can a player really be the most \u201cvaluable\u201d in the whole league if his team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/03/the-remarkable-thing-about-messis-miami-theyre-just-as-good-without-him\">performs almost exactly as well without him as they do with him</a>, as is the case with Miami and Messi? Wouldn\u2019t Benteke\u2019s 23 goals be considered more valuable, considering they make up an astonishing 44% of DC United\u2019s total? (That\u2019s the highest such percentage in the league; Bouanga is second, with 32% of LAFC\u2019s goals.) Where would FC Cincy be without Acosta pulling the strings at No 10, or the Crew without Cucho\u2019s clutch goals?</p> <p>In North America, MVP awards have not historically been won on \u201cper-game\u201d stats \u2013 rather, they recognize a body of work over as much of a full season as possible. If Messi finishes with 19 appearances in 2024, he will have appeared in just 55% of Inter Miami\u2019s games. Were he to win MVP, it would be by far the lowest percentage of games appeared in by an MVP in the history of North American men\u2019s major leagues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Lowest%20workloads%20for%20MVP%20winners&amp;standfirst=The%20lowest%20percentages%20of%20games%20played%20by%20a%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20in%20each%20of%20the%20five%20major%20North%20American%20men\u2019s%20sports%20leagues&amp;number-1=70.7%25&amp;field-1=Bill%20Walton%2C%20NBA%2C%201977-78&amp;number-2=71.4%25&amp;field-2=Mario%20Lemieux%2C%20NHL%2C%201992-93&amp;number-3=72.2%25&amp;field-3=George%20Brett%2C%20MLB%20(AL)%2C%201980&amp;number-4=75.3%25&amp;field-4=Gabby%20Hartnett%2C%20MLB%20(NL)%2C%201935&amp;number-5=78.1%25&amp;field-5=Taylor%20Twellman%2C%20MLS%2C%202005&amp;number-6=80.0%25&amp;field-6=John%20Elway%2C%20NFL%2C%201987&amp;number-7=&amp;field-7=&amp;number-8=&amp;field-8=\" data-alt=\"Lowest workloads for MVP winners\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=Lowest%20workloads%20for%20MVP%20winners&standfirst=The%20lowest%20percentages%20of%20games%20played%20by%20a%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20in%20each%20of%20the%20five%20major%20North%20American%20men\u2019s%20sports%20leagues&number-1=70.7%25&field-1=Bill%20Walton%2C%20NBA%2C%201977-78&number-2=71.4%25&field-2=Mario%20Lemieux%2C%20NHL%2C%201992-93&number-3=72.2%25&field-3=George%20Brett%2C%20MLB%20(AL)%2C%201980&number-4=75.3%25&field-4=Gabby%20Hartnett%2C%20MLB%20(NL)%2C%201935&number-5=78.1%25&field-5=Taylor%20Twellman%2C%20MLS%2C%202005&number-6=80.0%25&field-6=John%20Elway%2C%20NFL%2C%201987&number-7=&field-7=&number-8=&field-8=\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>There is plenty of historical precedent for a player to miss out on an MVP award by virtue of not playing enough.

      "bodyText": "In a development that will only come as a shock to newborns and extraterrestrials, Lionel Messi\u2019s MLS performances have been absolutely stellar this season. He has been a key part of the Inter Miami team at the top of the standings, has produced all manner of goals and assists, and has generally lived up to the hype every time he has stepped on the field. It\u2019s slightly more surprising that if his spectacular run ends with winning MLS\u2019s Most Valuable Player award (MVP), it would be unprecedented in North American men\u2019s sports and nearly unheard of in the most famous domestic men\u2019s leagues in Europe \u2013 with one very notable exception. At time of writing, Messi ranks fifth in the MLS goalscoring leaderboard with 17 and sixth in assists with 11, giving him 28 total goal contributions, good for third in the league. Those numbers are solid but hardly the stuff of a no-doubt MVP. And they aren\u2019t notable by Messi\u2019s astronomic standards. That is, until you consider that he has achieved those numbers in just 18 appearances. That low total is due to a long layoff after an ankle injury suffered during the Copa Am\u00e9rica, which kept him sidelined for months. Messi\u2019s total number of appearances will finalize at 19 assuming he plays in the regular-season finale on Saturday. He may add some goals and assists in that last game before the playoffs, but it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll finish the season leading the league in those categories. On a per-90 minute basis, though, Messi is leading the league in goals, assists, and the combination of the two. He is also overperforming the expected versions of those statistics according to FBref \u2013 in other words, he is finishing difficult chances at a high rate, and consistently delivering assists to his teammates in unlikely situations. These rough \u201cper game\u201d numbers stand out even in the context of Messi\u2019s glittering career: The only two domestic league seasons in which he boasted more goal contributions per 90 minutes than 2024 are two from his peak at Barcelona \u2013 2011-12, in which he notched 66 goal contributions in 37 games for an average of 1.94 per 90, and the following season, where he contributed 57 goals plus assists for an average of 1.82. With Inter Miami this season, Messi is hitting 1.73 goal contributions a game. Just as Barcelona and PSG, Inter Miami are reaping the benefits, clinching the Supporters\u2019 Shield for the best regular-season record in the league a few weeks ago. With a win in Saturday\u2019s finale, Miami would set a new MLS record for points in a single season. There are plenty of other solid candidates for the 2024 MLS MVP though. Cucho Hern\u00e1ndez has been the attacking talisman for the Columbus Crew, as has Luciano Acosta for an FC Cincinnati side that looks much different than it did a year ago. Christian Benteke will almost certainly win the Golden Boot, which automatically puts him in the MVP conversation. LAFC\u2019s Denis Bouanga has been as devastating on the dribble as he is in front of goal, and Messi\u2019s teammate Luis Su\u00e1rez has also been instrumental in Miami\u2019s success with his team-leading (for now) goal tally. Can a player really be the most \u201cvaluable\u201d in the whole league if his team performs almost exactly as well without him as they do with him, as is the case with Miami and Messi? Wouldn\u2019t Benteke\u2019s 23 goals be considered more valuable, considering they make up an astonishing 44% of DC United\u2019s total? (That\u2019s the highest such percentage in the league; Bouanga is second, with 32% of LAFC\u2019s goals.) Where would FC Cincy be without Acosta pulling the strings at No 10, or the Crew without Cucho\u2019s clutch goals? In North America, MVP awards have not historically been won on \u201cper-game\u201d stats \u2013 rather, they recognize a body of work over as much of a full season as possible. If Messi finishes with 19 appearances in 2024, he will have appeared in just 55% of Inter Miami\u2019s games. Were he to win MVP, it would be by far the lowest percentage of games appeared in by an MVP in the history of North American men\u2019s major leagues. There is plenty of historical precedent for a player to miss out on an MVP award by virtue of not playing enough. Joel Embiid lost out on one, and perhaps two, NBA MVPs in recent seasons, with at least part of the reasoning being that other players (most notably Nikola Joki\u0107) were on the court more often. He may struggle to ever win another one, with NBA rules now stipulating that MVP candidates must have played in at least 65 games, or about 79% of the season. In 2017, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz looked to be a surefire MVP before a torn ACL ended his season after 13 games. He finished the regular season with more passing touchdowns than Tom Brady, who won the award instead. (And like Messi, Wentz\u2019s absence didn\u2019t end up ruining the Eagles\u2019 season; they went on to win the Super Bowl over Brady and the Patriots with backup QB Nick Foles.) In baseball, Mike Trout in 2017 and Hanley Ramirez in 2013 each had incredible seasons impacted by injury, and neither were serious contenders in MVP voting despite being ahead of or close to the winners in key stats. The standards in Europe\u2019s big five soccer leagues are different, but not by much. For one thing, most of them have only recently started awarding MVP or MVP-like awards \u2013 for most of the circuits\u2019 histories, \u201cplayer of the season\u201d awards came from writers\u2019 associations or specific magazines. But among the newer crop of league-issued awards, Messi\u2019s 2024 participation level still falls short in every case but one. And that one might be the most applicable to Messi\u2019s 2024 \u2013 the thing to cite if you happen to believe that Messi deserves the Landon Donovan Award this year. The 2017-18 season was Neymar\u2019s first at PSG, and the Brazilian was at his peak, scoring 19 goals with 13 assists in 20 games. He fractured his metatarsal not long after the new year, though, and missed the rest of the season. Like Messi in 2024, that season\u2019s Neymar led the league in per-game performance. Like Messi in 2024, his absence didn\u2019t hurt his team much in the competition \u2013 PSG still won Ligue 1 easily. Also strangely like Messi in 2024, Neymar experienced this sort of season with a Uruguayan strike partner (Edinson Cavani) who finished as the team\u2019s top scorer. The question, then, is by which standard will Messi be judged \u2013 the one covering the country and league in which he plays, or the one that has made an exception in cases just like Messi\u2019s? The answer could easily turn out to be the same one as usual: That Messi\u2019s standard is his own, and others do not apply.",

Baltimore signing the aging back was one of the more intriguing moves of the offseason. Even amid the tantalizing prospect of a Henry-Lamar Jackson backfield, it was fair to wonder about the downside scenarios. How much tread was<em> </em>left on the tires? What if the Ravens were forced to feed him touches, taking the ball out of Jackson\u2019s hands? What if the offense became siloed, bouncing between a <a href=\"https://www.readoptional.com/p/who-do-the-titans-want-to-be\">structure that suited Henry</a> and one that better served the team\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/oct/14/lamar-jackson-baltimore-ravens-nfl-football-quarterback\">supernova quarterback</a>?</p> <p>Henry\u2019s answer to those questions, to paraphrase Marshawn Lynch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6hHBcOzz6Q\">run through everyone\u2019s face</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1840550601794482267\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DERRICK HENRY TO THE HOUSE ON THE 1ST PLAY \ud83e\udd2f<br><br>87 YARDS TD.<br><br>(via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NFL</a>)<a href=\"https://t.co/PG2LE1xyQs\">pic.twitter.com/PG2LE1xyQs</a></p>&mdash; Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1840550601794482267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <p>Through the opening six weeks of the season, Henry leads all players in rushing yards per game and rushing touchdowns. He is the only back with 10 or more rushing attempts to average 5.9 yards per carry \u2013 and has also notched <a href=\"https://x.com/BleacherReport/status/1840550601794482267\">the longest individual run of the season</a>. Any one of those would be impressive for a veteran who <em>should be</em> approaching the end of his career; to lead the pack in all four is objectively bonkers.</p> <p>The numbers keep coming. On 24 carries against the Commanders last week, Henry rushed for 34 yards over expectation, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. Only one player (Christian McCaffrey) hit that mark in four or more games last season. Henry has eclipsed it four times already<em> </em>this season. You almost have to refresh the page to check that he is really 30.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not get twisted, Lamar Jackson is the player who makes Baltimore\u2019s offense sing. Early in games, the threat of Jackson on the ground and through the air has opened up simpler rushing lanes for Henry. But where Henry has made his hay is in the second-half of games, entering sledgehammer mode against drained defenses.</p> <p>Henry has become the league\u2019s pre-eminent closer \u2013 the sport\u2019s answer to Mariano Rivera. In fourth quarters and overtime this season, Henry has averaged 6.8 yards a carry, rushing for 246 yards and a touchdown, according to Pro Football Focus. In the first-half of games, he has been used partly as a decoy and partly as a tool to wear defenses down, grinding out 4.3 yards a carry. As defenses start to wheeze in the second-half the Ravens lean on Henry to carry them home. By the fourth quarter, you can almost see opposing defenders pleading: \u201cCan you guys just take one play off?\u201d No. No, they cannot. In the final quarter, Henry\u2019s average jumps to 6.3 yards a carry.</p> <p>None of this is normal. It\u2019s even more remarkable when you consider Henry\u2019s vicious running style, workload and age.

      "bodyText": "The NFL is a passing league \u2013 or so we are told. It\u2019s been that way for close to 20 years. Every new rule, contract, coaching hire and draft slot reinforces that the sport is now engineered to attack or defend the air. But Derrick Henry, it seems, did not get the memo. In a league that chews up running backs with a ruthlessness that borders on disdain, Henry continues to plough ahead. In his ninth season, the 30-year-old future Hall of Famer tops the league in rushing \u2013 again. And it\u2019s not even particularly close. Six weeks in, Henry leads the rushing race by nearly 100 yards over San Francisco\u2019s Jordan Mason, doing so by thumping away between the tackles. It\u2019s not just Henry. Offenses across the league have looked to the ground game to ease the pressure on their passing attacks early in the new season, hoping to exploit voids in defensive schemes that are tailored to stem explosive passing games. Teams are rushing at the highest rate through six weeks since 2008, with sides averaging a record 4.5 yards per carry and more rushing per game at this point in a season in 40 years. But Henry still lives in a world of his own. Baltimore signing the aging back was one of the more intriguing moves of the offseason. Even amid the tantalizing prospect of a Henry-Lamar Jackson backfield, it was fair to wonder about the downside scenarios. How much tread was left on the tires? What if the Ravens were forced to feed him touches, taking the ball out of Jackson\u2019s hands? What if the offense became siloed, bouncing between a structure that suited Henry and one that better served the team\u2019s supernova quarterback? Henry\u2019s answer to those questions, to paraphrase Marshawn Lynch: run through everyone\u2019s face. Through the opening six weeks of the season, Henry leads all players in rushing yards per game and rushing touchdowns. He is the only back with 10 or more rushing attempts to average 5.9 yards per carry \u2013 and has also notched the longest individual run of the season. Any one of those would be impressive for a veteran who should be approaching the end of his career; to lead the pack in all four is objectively bonkers. The numbers keep coming. On 24 carries against the Commanders last week, Henry rushed for 34 yards over expectation, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. Only one player (Christian McCaffrey) hit that mark in four or more games last season. Henry has eclipsed it four times already this season. You almost have to refresh the page to check that he is really 30. Let\u2019s not get twisted, Lamar Jackson is the player who makes Baltimore\u2019s offense sing. Early in games, the threat of Jackson on the ground and through the air has opened up simpler rushing lanes for Henry. But where Henry has made his hay is in the second-half of games, entering sledgehammer mode against drained defenses. Henry has become the league\u2019s pre-eminent closer \u2013 the sport\u2019s answer to Mariano Rivera. In fourth quarters and overtime this season, Henry has averaged 6.8 yards a carry, rushing for 246 yards and a touchdown, according to Pro Football Focus. In the first-half of games, he has been used partly as a decoy and partly as a tool to wear defenses down, grinding out 4.3 yards a carry. As defenses start to wheeze in the second-half the Ravens lean on Henry to carry them home. By the fourth quarter, you can almost see opposing defenders pleading: \u201cCan you guys just take one play off?\u201d No. No, they cannot. In the final quarter, Henry\u2019s average jumps to 6.3 yards a carry. None of this is normal. It\u2019s even more remarkable when you consider Henry\u2019s vicious running style, workload and age. He has carried the ball 2,149 times in the pros, on top of the 609 times he carried in college and the 1,379 attempts in high school. Few backs sniff 2,000 carries. If they do, they\u2019re typically on their last legs. You only have to look at Henry\u2019s draft class to see how a back\u2019s career usually goes. Of the 19 running backs selected in the 2016 draft, only two remain on an active NFL roster this season: Henry and Ezekiel Elliott. Elliott is now a shadow of his former self, slogging away in Dallas\u2019 insipid offense. He has not rushed for more than four yards a carry since 2021, his lone career \u2018highlight\u2019 in that span being taking a snap as a center. Kenyan Drake, another lofty selection in the 2016 class, last played meaningful snaps in 2022. Jordan Howard, a Pro Bowler in his rookie season, last saw the field in 2022. As Henry continued to pile up rushing titles, the rest of his class was touring the UFL or brushing up on their sales skills. Everything about his game \u2013 his bone-crushing style, his longevity \u2013 continues to defy conventional wisdom.

      "body": "<p>To write a biography of a figure as well known as Marie Curie and still offer something fresh or surprising is no easy undertaking. The double Nobel prizewinner is, as author Dava Sobel acknowledges, the only female scientist most people can name. She has inspired more biopics and biographies than I can count, including those written by her two daughters. Parents of young children will have encountered her story in almost every one of the worthy children\u2019s anthologies that adorn school bookshelves: she features in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/04/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-review-inspiring-stuff-elena-favilli-francesca-callo\">Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls</a><em>, </em>She Persisted Around the World and Little People, Big Dreams.</p> <p>To help shed new light on such an iconic figure, Sobel, a bestselling writer of science histories, has interwoven her account of Curie\u2019s life and scientific discoveries with those of dozens of female scientists who passed through her lab in Paris.</p> <p>In doing so, she sets herself a monumental task. Curie\u2019s scientific output was prodigious, her personal life tumultuous and often difficult. She was born Maria Salomea Sk\u0142odowska in Poland in 1867, the fifth child of two schoolteachers. By the age of 10 she had lost her mother and one sister to tuberculosis and typhus. She worked as a governess until the family could raise enough money for her to enrol at the Sorbonne in Paris,&nbsp;where she was one of 23 women and about 2,000&nbsp;men to join the science faculty. After graduating top of her class, she won a scholarship to continue her&nbsp;studies.</p> <p>She met her husband, the physicist Pierre Curie, in 1894, while conducting research into the magnetic properties of steel. As newlyweds, they collaborated on Marie\u2019s doctoral thesis studying the unusual energy exuded by uranium. During their investigation of what they would later term radioactivity, they discovered two new elements \u2013 polonium and radium \u2013 and helped&nbsp;upend everything scientists understood about the material world. Curie\u2019s work would show that atoms&nbsp;were not, as had been believed, indivisible, the fundamental building blocks of our universe. But though the radium that she learned to extract from uranium ore could be used as a cancer treatment, it also&nbsp;caused cancer: many who worked in her lab,&nbsp;including most likely Curie herself, died as a result of their exposure.</p> <p>Alongside all the firsts \u2013 Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel prize and remains the only person to win Nobel prizes in two different scientific fields \u2013 she was also a devoted mother and carer for ageing relatives. She experienced the grief of miscarriage, and then in 1906 the earth-shattering loss of her beloved husband, Pierre, in a carriage accident. A few years later, she had an affair with the married physicist Paul Langevin that became a public scandal and virtually forced her into hiding. She lived through the first world war, when she led efforts to bring X-ray units closer to the battlefield to treat wounded soldiers, and drove one such <em>voiture radiologique </em>herself. She lectured far and wide and befriended many great scientists of her time, including Albert Einstein. There is, in other words, much to cover before you even consider the women whose paths briefly crossed with Curie\u2019s until their work or life took them in other directions.</p> <p>Dava Sobel is a former New York Times science reporter and the author of bestsellers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/aug/20/ameliahill\">Galileo\u2019s Daughter</a> and Longitude<em>, </em>which tells the extraordinary story of how an 18th-century clockmaker solved the greatest scientific problem of his time. She is skilled at explaining complex science clearly and has chosen an artful way to structure her material, emphasising the collision of science and biography by giving each chapter the name of a scientist and an element. But with so much ground to cover, the emotional heart of many stories is lost in a sea of new names, or detailed accounts of important but esoteric work to, say, settle a dispute regarding the half-life of an element.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Her romantic entanglements and principled political stands suggest she was a woman of many passions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One particularly intriguing figure is Harriet Brooks, a prominent Canadian physicist who worked briefly at Curie\u2019s lab before giving up her research to marry. Three years later, and despite her own impressive career, she publicly blamed the dearth of female scientists on women\u2019s intellectual and physical shortcomings and suggested that, although Curie was exceptional, her output had declined after Pierre\u2019s death.</p> <p>What was behind this, I wondered? What did Curie make of it all? We don\u2019t find out. Sobel is unable to tell us much about Curie\u2019s relationships with others in her lab. Many seem to have worked more closely with her&nbsp;colleague, Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne, than with Curie, who was frequently grief-stricken or unwell or occupied&nbsp;with her own work. The scientists\u2019 recorded observations about their boss often do little more than&nbsp;confirm the rather superficial public image we have of her as a sad, reserved woman in a dark formal&nbsp;dress, whose rare smiles were reserved for scientific breakthroughs.</p> <p>One of the researchers Curie did work very closely with was her eldest daughter, Ir\u00e8ne, who would later win a Nobel prize, too. Marie and Ir\u00e8ne\u2019s relationship was adoring and apparently \u2013 though it is hard to believe this is the whole story \u2013 uncomplicated. Sobel does an excellent job of helping the reader to understand the historical importance and context of Curie\u2019s work, but her interior life remains largely mysterious. I found myself itching to consult other sources \u2013 her collected letters to her daughters, her mourning journal, the biography written by her other daughter, \u00c8ve \u2013 in order to fill in the gaps. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/06/biography.scienceandnature\">Observer review: Obsessive Genius by Barbara Goldsmith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I suspect this partly reflects the difficulty of writing about someone so emotionally reserved. When Curie was passed over for entry to the prestigious Acad\u00e9mie de Sciences in favour of a less qualified man, for instance, she made no public comment, and at other&nbsp;points of high drama in her personal life she simply threw herself into work. And yet, work was never&nbsp;her whole world \u2013 her romantic entanglements and principled political stands suggest she was a woman of many passions, and I wanted to better understand them. At one point, Curie compares herself to a silkworm, writing to her niece of her career that: \u201cI did&nbsp;those things because something obliged me to, just as the silkworm is compelled to spin its cocoon.\u201d But even if Curie lacked insight into her own motivations, you\u2019d want a biographer to advance a few well-supported theories.</p> <p>Curie once wrote of Pierre that \u201che lived on a plane so rare and so elevated that he sometimes seemed to me a being unique in his freedom from all vanity and from the littleness that one discovers in oneself and in others\u201d. In Sobel\u2019s telling, Curie strikes the reader as a similarly noble, almost saintly figure \u2013 but don\u2019t we all have foibles and flaws? As to the other women Sobel writes about, they are admirable and inspiring, but given such hasty, breathless treatment that they feel as one-dimensional and lifeless as the characters that populate Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls.</p> <p>\u2022 The Elements of Marie Curie: How the Glow of Radium Lit a Path for Women in Science is published by 4th Estate on 24 October (\u00a322).

To help shed new light on such an iconic figure, Sobel, a bestselling writer of science histories, has interwoven her account of Curie\u2019s life and scientific discoveries with those of dozens of female scientists who passed through her lab in Paris. In doing so, she sets herself a monumental task. Curie\u2019s scientific output was prodigious, her personal life tumultuous and often difficult. She was born Maria Salomea Sk\u0142odowska in Poland in 1867, the fifth child of two schoolteachers. By the age of 10 she had lost her mother and one sister to tuberculosis and typhus. She worked as a governess until the family could raise enough money for her to enrol at the Sorbonne in Paris, where she was one of 23 women and about 2,000 men to join the science faculty. After graduating top of her class, she won a scholarship to continue her studies. She met her husband, the physicist Pierre Curie, in 1894, while conducting research into the magnetic properties of steel. As newlyweds, they collaborated on Marie\u2019s doctoral thesis studying the unusual energy exuded by uranium. During their investigation of what they would later term radioactivity, they discovered two new elements \u2013 polonium and radium \u2013 and helped upend everything scientists understood about the material world. Curie\u2019s work would show that atoms were not, as had been believed, indivisible, the fundamental building blocks of our universe. But though the radium that she learned to extract from uranium ore could be used as a cancer treatment, it also caused cancer: many who worked in her lab, including most likely Curie herself, died as a result of their exposure. Alongside all the firsts \u2013 Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel prize and remains the only person to win Nobel prizes in two different scientific fields \u2013 she was also a devoted mother and carer for ageing relatives. She experienced the grief of miscarriage, and then in 1906 the earth-shattering loss of her beloved husband, Pierre, in a carriage accident. A few years later, she had an affair with the married physicist Paul Langevin that became a public scandal and virtually forced her into hiding. She lived through the first world war, when she led efforts to bring X-ray units closer to the battlefield to treat wounded soldiers, and drove one such voiture radiologique herself. She lectured far and wide and befriended many great scientists of her time, including Albert Einstein. There is, in other words, much to cover before you even consider the women whose paths briefly crossed with Curie\u2019s until their work or life took them in other directions. Dava Sobel is a former New York Times science reporter and the author of bestsellers such as Galileo\u2019s Daughter and Longitude, which tells the extraordinary story of how an 18th-century clockmaker solved the greatest scientific problem of his time. She is skilled at explaining complex science clearly and has chosen an artful way to structure her material, emphasising the collision of science and biography by giving each chapter the name of a scientist and an element. But with so much ground to cover, the emotional heart of many stories is lost in a sea of new names, or detailed accounts of important but esoteric work to, say, settle a dispute regarding the half-life of an element. One particularly intriguing figure is Harriet Brooks, a prominent Canadian physicist who worked briefly at Curie\u2019s lab before giving up her research to marry. Three years later, and despite her own impressive career, she publicly blamed the dearth of female scientists on women\u2019s intellectual and physical shortcomings and suggested that, although Curie was exceptional, her output had declined after Pierre\u2019s death. What was behind this, I wondered? What did Curie make of it all? We don\u2019t find out. Sobel is unable to tell us much about Curie\u2019s relationships with others in her lab. Many seem to have worked more closely with her colleague, Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne, than with Curie, who was frequently grief-stricken or unwell or occupied with her own work. The scientists\u2019 recorded observations about their boss often do little more than confirm the rather superficial public image we have of her as a sad, reserved woman in a dark formal dress, whose rare smiles were reserved for scientific breakthroughs. One of the researchers Curie did work very closely with was her eldest daughter, Ir\u00e8ne, who would later win a Nobel prize, too. Marie and Ir\u00e8ne\u2019s relationship was adoring and apparently \u2013 though it is hard to believe this is the whole story \u2013 uncomplicated. Sobel does an excellent job of helping the reader to understand the historical importance and context of Curie\u2019s work, but her interior life remains largely mysterious. I found myself itching to consult other sources \u2013 her collected letters to her daughters, her mourning journal, the biography written by her other daughter, \u00c8ve \u2013 in order to fill in the gaps. I suspect this partly reflects the difficulty of writing about someone so emotionally reserved. When Curie was passed over for entry to the prestigious Acad\u00e9mie de Sciences in favour of a less qualified man, for instance, she made no public comment, and at other points of high drama in her personal life she simply threw herself into work. And yet, work was never her whole world \u2013 her romantic entanglements and principled political stands suggest she was a woman of many passions, and I wanted to better understand them. At one point, Curie compares herself to a silkworm, writing to her niece of her career that: \u201cI did those things because something obliged me to, just as the silkworm is compelled to spin its cocoon.\u201d But even if Curie lacked insight into her own motivations, you\u2019d want a biographer to advance a few well-supported theories. Curie once wrote of Pierre that \u201che lived on a plane so rare and so elevated that he sometimes seemed to me a being unique in his freedom from all vanity and from the littleness that one discovers in oneself and in others\u201d. In Sobel\u2019s telling, Curie strikes the reader as a similarly noble, almost saintly figure \u2013 but don\u2019t we all have foibles and flaws? As to the other women Sobel writes about, they are admirable and inspiring, but given such hasty, breathless treatment that they feel as one-dimensional and lifeless as the characters that populate Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls. \u2022 The Elements of Marie Curie: How the Glow of Radium Lit a Path for Women in Science is published by 4th Estate on 24 October (\u00a322).

Finally on Thursday, the extent of Nine\u2019s toxic TV newsroom culture was laid bare. In a remarkably frank independent report, which includes the heartbreaking anonymised experiences of staff, Nine\u2019s broadcast division is painted as a workplace in which sexual harassment, bullying and abuse of power is systemic. The report even alludes to the notorious comment, made by the late news director John Westacott, when a staffer says women were expected to be conventionally attractive to get ahead. \u201cThey used to say, when they were considering women for roles, that they\u2019d rate her on her \u2018fuckability\u2019,\u201d one woman told the report\u2019s authors. \u201cThey obviously can\u2019t say that now \u2013 so they say \u2018that woman has star power\u2019 instead. But it means the same thing.\u201d It\u2019s always been an open secret that Nine, under the late media mogul Kerry Packer and larrikin chief executives such as David Leckie, had a blokey and sexist culture, but management has certainly never admitted it.

At night the sound is punctuated by more violent intrusions: Israeli missile strikes, sirens, gunfire and the screams of frightened people.

It is a layer of the war that experts associate with long term psychological trauma.<br><br></p> \n<h2>Night</h2> \n<p><br>At 3am, the incessant buzzing of the drones pauses \u2013 unusually. Breaks from the unsettling, high-pitched whirring that Palestinians call the \u201c<em>zanzana</em>\u201d are rare so its absence is noticeable.</p> \n<p>But even as Shahd al-Modallal\u2019s ears clear from the drone noises, there is suddenly a series of loud explosions. In the darkness, her family scrambles.</p> \n<p><br>The only light comes from their phones and a red glow outside. </p> \n<p>As gunfire hammers the neighbourhood, the family scream at each other to gather together, trying to stay close in the chaos.</p> \n<p>Rafah, in the south of Gaza, was supposed to be a safe zone but in reality at no point in this year-long war has it been spared from fighting. A 22-year-old English literature student who also ran her own stationery business, Modallal has watched her hometown transformed by fighting and learned to differentiate between the weapons Israel sends overhead by their different noises. As she cowers in the darkness reciting the Islamic declaration of faith \u2013 \u201cI bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his messenger\u201d \u2013 as Muslims do daily and when they fear death is close, there are sounds outside that she has never heard before.</p> \n<p>All three times Modallal\u2019s neighbourhood has been bombed it happened at night, when people can see almost nothing in the darkness and so strain their ears to hear the noises that haunt them afterwards.</p> \n<p>Like most Gazans, Modallal has adapted to war by staying awake throughout the night, hearing the missiles fly and land, learning how the sounds differ when they are at a safe distance, and almost constantly disturbed by the noise of drones. When the buzzing occasionally does stop, Modallal says she feels unbalanced \u2013 as if her ears have suddenly popped \u2013 and fearful. The pauses often mean the drones have chosen a target and will be replaced by airstrikes.</p> \n<p>It is only when morning comes that Modallal can sleep.<br></p> \n<h2>Day</h2> \n<p>Each time he has to leave his sheltering place, Bader al-Zaharna loads his belongings onto his bicycle. Neighbours call out to each other, urging everyone to make the journey together. They grab the bags they now keep ready at all times and then trudge to their next destination, mostly in silence, aside from the clatter of carts pulled by undernourished donkeys transporting their anything of value: clothes, medicine, jewellery and food. An aspiring short-story writer who has studied in the US in pursuit of his passion, Zaharna also makes sure to grab his laptop so he can continue writing.</p> \n<p>In the background, Zaharna can hear explosions. He says sometimes it feels like they are in time with his heartbeat, and he fears the next one will come down on his head. He has a heart condition \u2013 tachycardia \u2013 and these sounds regularly send his heart rate out of control, even with his medication.</p> \n<p>After initially leaving his neighbourhood of Tofah in Gaza City when Israeli ground troops invaded in October, Zaharna and his family returned to the city in December. But they have been displaced four times since then, shuttling between their own home in the city\u2019s east and a relative\u2019s in the west. After several months during which they were able to remain at home, they were displaced again in October, after renewed operations in the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp meant the resumption of bombardment close to their home.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/gaza_journeys_hs/giv-4559QCyMvg8NY9ui/\" data-alt=\"Set of maps showing Zaharna\u2019s journeys inside Gaza\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/gaza_journeys_hs/giv-4559QCyMvg8NY9ui/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Each time, their movement is dictated by an order from the Israeli military. Their phones ring with either a withheld number or one they initially could not recognise but have now become familiar with. When they answer, a gruff, robotic pre-recorded voice tells them to leave where they currently are.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe voice sounds really frightening, it\u2019s like someone threatening you, ordering to leave, to evacuate and giving you an order to move south, sometimes, to move east, west \u2026 You\u2019ve got no option to actually talk to a human being, to ask questions, to negotiate. It\u2019s all recorded. It\u2019s like you\u2019re talking to an AI.\u201d</p> \n<p>Zaharna says the calls appear to be geographically targeted rather than sent to specific numbers and can add to the feeling of being hounded. Even when they answer them, the calls continue to come as long as they are in the area, his phone ringing a dozen times in a single day.</p> \n<p>Modallal\u2019s days are quieter than the nights. She feels it\u2019s a sort of punishment \u2013 they are kept fearful when they can see almost nothing.</p> \n<p>The sound of the drone is constant but the city\u2019s usual sounds have faded \u2013 there is no sound of traffic or people at work, unless you are near the few operating markets or aid collection points. So all other sounds are amplified.</p> \n<p>For several months there were new sounds \u2013 a displaced family in the home next door could be heard at almost all times, their children occasionally playing. Until one of the strikes on their neighbourhood killed the family \u2013 silencing them utterly. Modallal never learned their names.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt felt like we were living in a ghost town. Whichever direction you turned to, there was someone who had been murdered,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>The sounds of the day form a backdrop to the new daily routines and everyone learns to differentiate between the sounds of explosions or gunfire and estimate how distant they are. Children have adapted: some are terrified by all sounds but others have stopped flinching.</p> \n<p>The sound of drones is not new to Gaza - it has long been associated with disrupted sleep \u2013 but over the past year, the sound has been relentless. Children look up at the sinister-looking electronic machines and yell at them to leave.</p> \n<p>In the daytime, families search for the missing. There is no rescue or lifting machinery so that search is quiet \u2013 the gentle crushing sound of broken glass or rubble being heaved. Families call out the names of the missing. Where people have disappeared, half-starved dogs roam. Some have been seen feeding on corpses.</p> \n<p>The daytimes are busy with the tasks of survival \u2013 going out to get any food that is available, looking for aid, water or firewood, trying to find a place to charge phones. Women often gather around fires they have built to cook meals for their families; Modallal sometimes records the conversations they occupy themselves with.<br><br></p> \n<h2>Night, again</h2> \n<p>Zaharna\u2019s phone rings again. The terror of the call at night is the worst, disturbing him when he tries but fails to sleep.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe sounds of war occupy my head. I have a lot of nightmares,\u201d says Zaharna.</p> \n<p>\u201cReceiving that call at night is the worst thing ever. It\u2019s night, it\u2019s dangerous. Sometimes I feel too traumatised to tell my mum and dad that I\u2019ve received a call, that we need to move.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was one time when they did move at night \u2013 it was the first time they received one of the calls to evacuate. They left with nothing, because they had not yet learned to keep a bag packed at all times, and stepped into the night.</p> \n<p>Now Zaharna tries to hold out through the night and wait for the morning before he moves again, listening to the sounds of the city around him: explosions, gunfire, sirens.</p> \n<p>The sounds that come mostly raise questions \u2013 about their safety, or the safety of others. Sirens occasionally pass as the civil defence try to respond to air strikes.</p> \n<p>So Zaharna\u2019s family hold tight and hope they can survive till the morning.<br><br></p> \n<h2>Long-term impact</h2> \n<p><br>Modallal listens to voice notes on her phone sent from Gaza by her father and brother. Often, she can barely hear what they are saying over the drones and explosions. She cannot summon the strength to ask them to repeat themselves.</p> \n<p>In March, Modallal was able to escape Gaza with her mother, but the rest of her family were not allowed to cross the Egyptian border. She made her way to Ireland and watched as the long-threatened ground invasion of Rafah happened in May and the rest of her family sought refuge elsewhere. She tries to continue with her life but is constantly worried about their safety.</p> \n<p>When the war does end, its sounds are likely to have a lasting effect on the population. Studies from Afghanistan have shown that communities can suffer collective trauma in response to the drones and airstrikes.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe drone, the buzzing sound, is an audible reminder that you can be killed at any moment and that has very serious mental health consequences,\u201d says James Cavallaro, co-author of a study on the subject in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201c[High] levels of stress, accelerated heart rates, high blood pressure, post-traumatic stress disorder, full-blown psychiatric episodes. All of those consequences we heard about.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/15/rafah-gaza-israel-airstrikes-war\">Bahzad Al-Akhras</a>, a psychiatrist now living in the Mawasi displacement camp, says everyone is now more conscious of the noise of the \u201cmilitary machines\u201d and show signs of hypervigilance \u2013 a state of being constantly on guard, often associated with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has become the normal behaviour \u2026 you are expecting the bad thing to happen. This is abnormal to live in this way,\u201d he says. \u201cLiving in survival mode, trying always to escape is affecting our sense of security. These sounds are continuously heard, are in our ears, we are living this again and again \u2026 [the young] are learning that nothing is secure, nothing is stable. They have learnt to continuously escape, not to trust others, not to trust life itself.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the most impactful thing: the sounds of bombs, the sounds of warplanes, the sounds of F-16s. We can recognise the missiles from their sounds,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the beginning we could not sleep but we have now what you can call an \u2018alert sleep\u2019; superficially we are sleeping but we cannot reach the point of deep sleep because of these sounds.\u201d</p> \n<p>Insomnia extends beyond Gaza. Modallal still struggles to sleep until after 3am \u2013 when the risk of airstrikes would usually recede.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can imagine the explosions and the sounds \u2026 sometimes I really do hate the night time. I can\u2019t sleep until I see the light.\u201d<br><br><em>Imagery and videos courtesy of Shahd al-Modallal, Bader al-Zaharna, Medical Aid for Palestinians, Azooz on Snapchat, Afaf Ahmed on Instagram, and Getty.</em></p>",

Even when they answer them, the calls continue to come as long as they are in the area, his phone ringing a dozen times in a single day. Modallal\u2019s days are quieter than the nights. She feels it\u2019s a sort of punishment \u2013 they are kept fearful when they can see almost nothing. The sound of the drone is constant but the city\u2019s usual sounds have faded \u2013 there is no sound of traffic or people at work, unless you are near the few operating markets or aid collection points. So all other sounds are amplified. For several months there were new sounds \u2013 a displaced family in the home next door could be heard at almost all times, their children occasionally playing. Until one of the strikes on their neighbourhood killed the family \u2013 silencing them utterly. Modallal never learned their names. \u201cIt felt like we were living in a ghost town. Whichever direction you turned to, there was someone who had been murdered,\u201d she says. The sounds of the day form a backdrop to the new daily routines and everyone learns to differentiate between the sounds of explosions or gunfire and estimate how distant they are. Children have adapted: some are terrified by all sounds but others have stopped flinching. The sound of drones is not new to Gaza - it has long been associated with disrupted sleep \u2013 but over the past year, the sound has been relentless. Children look up at the sinister-looking electronic machines and yell at them to leave. In the daytime, families search for the missing. There is no rescue or lifting machinery so that search is quiet \u2013 the gentle crushing sound of broken glass or rubble being heaved. Families call out the names of the missing. Where people have disappeared, half-starved dogs roam. Some have been seen feeding on corpses. The daytimes are busy with the tasks of survival \u2013 going out to get any food that is available, looking for aid, water or firewood, trying to find a place to charge phones. Women often gather around fires they have built to cook meals for their families; Modallal sometimes records the conversations they occupy themselves with. Night, again Zaharna\u2019s phone rings again. The terror of the call at night is the worst, disturbing him when he tries but fails to sleep. \u201cThe sounds of war occupy my head. I have a lot of nightmares,\u201d says Zaharna. \u201cReceiving that call at night is the worst thing ever. It\u2019s night, it\u2019s dangerous. Sometimes I feel too traumatised to tell my mum and dad that I\u2019ve received a call, that we need to move.\u201d There was one time when they did move at night \u2013 it was the first time they received one of the calls to evacuate. They left with nothing, because they had not yet learned to keep a bag packed at all times, and stepped into the night. Now Zaharna tries to hold out through the night and wait for the morning before he moves again, listening to the sounds of the city around him: explosions, gunfire, sirens. The sounds that come mostly raise questions \u2013 about their safety, or the safety of others. Sirens occasionally pass as the civil defence try to respond to air strikes. So Zaharna\u2019s family hold tight and hope they can survive till the morning. Long-term impact Modallal listens to voice notes on her phone sent from Gaza by her father and brother. Often, she can barely hear what they are saying over the drones and explosions. She cannot summon the strength to ask them to repeat themselves. In March, Modallal was able to escape Gaza with her mother, but the rest of her family were not allowed to cross the Egyptian border. She made her way to Ireland and watched as the long-threatened ground invasion of Rafah happened in May and the rest of her family sought refuge elsewhere. She tries to continue with her life but is constantly worried about their safety. When the war does end, its sounds are likely to have a lasting effect on the population. Studies from Afghanistan have shown that communities can suffer collective trauma in response to the drones and airstrikes. \u201cThe drone, the buzzing sound, is an audible reminder that you can be killed at any moment and that has very serious mental health consequences,\u201d says James Cavallaro, co-author of a study on the subject in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201c[High] levels of stress, accelerated heart rates, high blood pressure, post-traumatic stress disorder, full-blown psychiatric episodes. All of those consequences we heard about.\u201d Bahzad Al-Akhras, a psychiatrist now living in the Mawasi displacement camp, says everyone is now more conscious of the noise of the \u201cmilitary machines\u201d and show signs of hypervigilance \u2013 a state of being constantly on guard, often associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cThis has become the normal behaviour \u2026 you are expecting the bad thing to happen. This is abnormal to live in this way,\u201d he says. \u201cLiving in survival mode, trying always to escape is affecting our sense of security. These sounds are continuously heard, are in our ears, we are living this again and again \u2026 [the young] are learning that nothing is secure, nothing is stable. They have learnt to continuously escape, not to trust others, not to trust life itself. \u201cThis is the most impactful thing: the sounds of bombs, the sounds of warplanes, the sounds of F-16s. We can recognise the missiles from their sounds,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the beginning we could not sleep but we have now what you can call an \u2018alert sleep\u2019; superficially we are sleeping but we cannot reach the point of deep sleep because of these sounds.\u201d Insomnia extends beyond Gaza. Modallal still struggles to sleep until after 3am \u2013 when the risk of airstrikes would usually recede. \u201cI can imagine the explosions and the sounds \u2026 sometimes I really do hate the night time. I can\u2019t sleep until I see the light.\u201d Imagery and videos courtesy of Shahd al-Modallal, Bader al-Zaharna, Medical Aid for Palestinians, Azooz on Snapchat, Afaf Ahmed on Instagram, and Getty.",

The National Sculpture Garden, designed in the early 1980s, will need to attract about $60m in philanthropy and fundraising to realise the design of the winning multi-disciplinary team CO-AP Holdings, comprising Sydney architecture company CO-AP and landscape and urban designers Studio JEF, TARN Studio and Plus Minus Design. The design includes seven interconnected gardens weaving around the National Gallery in a continuous circuit on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin, which will double the ground\u2019s total space for showcasing art, culture and nature. The sculpture garden\u2019s existing marquee will be replaced with a permanent stainless steel and glass pavilion that will provide additional exhibition space, a new promenade and a multi-use campus square in the NGA forecourt.

      "bodyText": "A high-ranking New South Wales police officer charged with drink-driving offences is scheduled to face a two-day hearing later this year, a Sydney court has been told, amid extraordinary secrecy measures around the matter. The officer, who can only be referred to as AB under a 40-year court order, allegedly crashed a police car in Sydney\u2019s NorthConnex tunnel after getting drunk at a work function in May 2023. He was later charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and high-range drink-driving. The officer pleaded not guilty to the charges in December. Separately, in July this year, the New South Wales police watchdog made two findings of \u201cserious misconduct\u201d against the detective. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email On Thursday, the drink-driving matter was briefly mentioned in the Downing Centre local court. The court was told a hearing was scheduled for the end of November but the matter would return on 7 November for the \u201coutcome of negotiations\u201d. Guardian Australia was in court on Thursday but the court initially refused to reveal in which court room the matter would be heard. This meant the matter would effectively be heard in secret. Normally, cases are listed in an online public registry which provides information regarding when and where a matter is to be heard. AB\u2019s case was not listed. On Wednesday, Guardian Australia emailed the court requesting the court room for Thursday\u2019s mention. However, the court said it was unable to disclose any information that identified the defendant or details of the matter and that the court room would not be disclosed. Other media outlets were also told the court room would not be revealed. Guardian Australia and some other media outlets had been unable to attend AB\u2019s previous mention in September when denied the same information. On Wednesday afternoon, media contacted the office of the state attorney general, Michael Daley, to express concern that access had effectively been denied by the court. Shortly afterwards, the registrar provided the room location. The police watchdog in July found AB \u201cwas treated more leniently in the way in which he was managed by his commander and in the police review of his driving\u201d. This \u201cfavourable treatment\u201d led other police officers to lose confidence in the integrity of the force, the report stated. The report, which does not form part of the drink-driving proceedings, found the loyalty AB\u2019s commander felt towards the detective meant he failed to make impartial decisions on subsequent risk-management actions. The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission also made a serious misconduct finding against the officer \u201cfor deliberately leaving the scene of a crash he caused \u2026 to avoid being breath-tested\u201d. A police summary noted in the report said AB had consumed 13 schooners of XXXX Gold and eight mixed-spirit drinks before the crash. Asked on what basis the court had initially made the decision to not inform media outlets of the room the matter was in, a local court spokesperson said: \u201cThe matter is subject to a suppression order, the details of which were reviewed by the registrar following an inquiry from media.\u201d \u201cFollowing this review of the court file and the suppression order in effect, the registrar determined that the court room listing details were able to be made available to media and this was actioned promptly.\u201d A suppression order on the case restricts the disclosure of any information that could identify the accused. It states the commissioner of police is to be \u201cnotified of any application for access to the court file and is to have the opportunity to be heard prior to any decision on access\u201d. Sam Lee, a solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre and expert in police accountability, said while the court took into account a number of factors whether to make a suppression order it was \u201ccritical that NSW police are not considered above the law\u201d. \u201cWhen it has been alleged an officer has committed an offence, the principle of open justice requires that an officer be subject to the same level of transparency as the general public,\u201d she said on Thursday. \u201cWithout openness, integrity wilts away.\u201d The NSW attorney general, Michael Daley, declined to comment.

      "body": "<p>Tim Winton and speculative fiction may seem an odd combination. His novels excel at the here and now, depicting lives at the margins, young love and young parenthood, violence at the hands of fathers. But the harsh beauty of the western Australian landscape has long been a presence in his work, and Winton has also long highlighted his country\u2019s fragility in the face of climate chaos, and been fiercely critical of the exploitation of Australia\u2019s mineral wealth. So the cli-fi premise of Juice, his latest novel, could be a perfect Winton fit.</p> <p>Set in an unspecified future, some centuries from now, the book opens on a man and a girl driving across a landscape blackened by ashes. The hellscape is worthy of the Mad Max franchise, with slave colonies springing up from the parched earth like termite mounds. There are echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\">Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road</a> here, too, in the black dust thrown up by the vehicle\u2019s tyres, and in the child passenger, observing everything with a mute wariness.</p> <p>The pair pull up at an abandoned mining station hoping for shelter, only to find that someone has beaten them to it \u2013 a rough figure with a crossbow, who is mistrustful of strangers. What unfolds is a long night of story. Taken captive, forced to talk in exchange for water \u2013 indeed, for his life and that of the child \u2013 Winton\u2019s protagonist seeks to explain himself to the bowman.</p> <p>We come to understand where we are in time and climate. \u201cThe Terror\u201d of societal collapse is generations behind us. After the equatorial regions became uninhabitable, the ensuing wars and mass migrations gave rise to untold further suffering.

      "bodyText": "Tim Winton and speculative fiction may seem an odd combination. His novels excel at the here and now, depicting lives at the margins, young love and young parenthood, violence at the hands of fathers. But the harsh beauty of the western Australian landscape has long been a presence in his work, and Winton has also long highlighted his country\u2019s fragility in the face of climate chaos, and been fiercely critical of the exploitation of Australia\u2019s mineral wealth. So the cli-fi premise of Juice, his latest novel, could be a perfect Winton fit. Set in an unspecified future, some centuries from now, the book opens on a man and a girl driving across a landscape blackened by ashes. The hellscape is worthy of the Mad Max franchise, with slave colonies springing up from the parched earth like termite mounds. There are echoes of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road here, too, in the black dust thrown up by the vehicle\u2019s tyres, and in the child passenger, observing everything with a mute wariness. The pair pull up at an abandoned mining station hoping for shelter, only to find that someone has beaten them to it \u2013 a rough figure with a crossbow, who is mistrustful of strangers. What unfolds is a long night of story. Taken captive, forced to talk in exchange for water \u2013 indeed, for his life and that of the child \u2013 Winton\u2019s protagonist seeks to explain himself to the bowman. We come to understand where we are in time and climate. \u201cThe Terror\u201d of societal collapse is generations behind us. After the equatorial regions became uninhabitable, the ensuing wars and mass migrations gave rise to untold further suffering. Now the remnants of human civilisation are clustered across the globe\u2019s far northern and southern reaches.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s been keeping us busy: Mysterious tar balls washing up in Sydney have forced the closure of seven beaches, including Bondi, but authorities are yet to identify where they are coming from. Nine Entertainment has apologised after an independent report found it has a systemic issue with the abuse of power and authority, bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment across the company. The Sydney Harbour Bridge has reopened to traffic after a fatal collision that killed two people, but drivers were urged to avoid the area. An LNP candidate in the upcoming Queensland election has alleged he was physically assaulted by two people and told \u201cshut your union-bashing mouth\u201d. Australia\u2019s economy added far more jobs than expected last month, as the labour market continues to go gangbusters, making an interest rate cut this side of Christmas less likely. A three-year-old child is fighting for life after being hit by a car on a major thoroughfare in Melbourne\u2019s south-east. The ACT Liberal leader, Elizabeth Lee, has apologised for raising her middle finger at a journalist after a heated news conference days out from the territory election, though the journalist said the conflict \u201cundermines the democratic process\u201d. The suspension of The Star Sydney\u2019s licence has been prolonged and an additional $15m handed down in fines after a second probe into the casino revealed further, significant failings. Thank you for joining us today. We\u2019ll be back bright and early tomorrow morning. Take care! NSW government previews Opera House illumination ahead of Royal visit Here\u2019s a preview of the light installation that will be displayed on the Sydney Opera House to coincide with the arrival of King Charles III and Queen Camilla this weekend. The New South Wales government has released images of the photo montage it will project on the Opera House\u2019s sails after testing it out early this morning: The building will be lit up with a four-minute photo montage depicting the king\u2019s and queen\u2019s previous visits to NSW and Australia from 8pm Friday: The government has said members of the public will have the opportunity to see the British royals at the Opera House forecourt at 4.20pm next Tuesday, 22 October. Staff \u2018furious\u2019 as ANU announces more job cuts The Australian National University has announced a further 108 job losses after earlier this month cutting 50 positions, leaving staff \u201cfurious\u201d. The ANU revealed the changes today as part of ongoing restructure efforts, which will also see 21 new roles created. The university on Tuesday also asked staff to forgo an agreed pay rise to save jobs, which the National Tertiary Education Union\u2019s ACT Division Secretary Dr Lachlan Clohesy claimed would not work: It is staggering that a Vice Chancellor thinks they can convince staff that giving up their pay will save jobs, while at the same time announcing further job cuts. The NTEU ANU branch president, Millan Pintos-Lopez, said ANU staff were \u201cfurious that a vice-chancellor is promising to save jobs while cutting them\u201d. Last week the ANU Council gave directions to the chancellery to reduce the university\u2019s recurring cost base by $250m by the end of 2025, including $100m in staff expenditure. The NTEU estimated that a $100m cut will end up leaving a total of 638 full-time equivalent staff out of work. An ANU spokesperson said staff affected by the proposed changes had been advised prior to today\u2019s staff meetings. In an email to the community, the vice-chancellor, Genevieve Bell, encouraged staff to engage in consultation processes and seek support: I urge you to seek support in whatever form you need \u2013 including the staff supports provided through our wellbeing teams. Change can be deeply unsettling, and the safety and wellbeing of staff is of paramount importance. You can read more on ANU\u2019s finances below: We have some breaking news at the conclusion of that press conference. Two lanes of the Sydney Harbour Bridge have been reopened after extensive delays, the coordinator-general of Transport for NSW, Howard Collins, has confirmed. Just as the press conference was wrapping up, Collins was alerted traffic was resuming in a limited fashion on the bridge. But he warned with cars backed up for 12km, it was best for drivers to avoid the bridge and take diverted routes. Jordan Rosser, NSW Ambulance\u2019s acting zone manager for Sydney, said a helicopter came to the scene of the Sydney Harbour Bridge crash and assessed four people at the scene. They found two people deceased and a further two people were transported to Royal North Shore hospital in a stable condition. Drivers told to \u2018avoid the area\u2019 of Harbour Bridge NSW authorities are urging Sydneysiders to avoid the area around the Sydney Harbour Bridge after today\u2019s crash. Both north and southbound lanes remain closed. The coordinator-general of Transport for NSW, Howard Collins, told the press conference the traffic may be protracted even if lanes open to clear for the afternoon peak. NSW government employee arrested over alleged sexual assaults Police allege a man used his position as a NSW government employee to arrange for two women to meet him, where they were sexually assaulted. The man, aged 54, will face court today in Penrith after being arrested this morning at a home in Windsor, on Sydney\u2019s north-western edge. He was taken to the local police station and refused bail. Police were investigating reports that a 41-year-old woman was sexually assaulted in August. During the investigation, detectives spoke with a 55-year-old woman who was allegedly sexually assaulted at a Concord home in March. The man is charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, carry out sexual act with another without consent, and intentionally record intimate image without consent. NSW police are also holding a press conference this hour with more information about the fatal crash which has closed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Our reporter Caitlin Cassidy is at that press conference and informs us a 28-year-old man is in hospital in a stable condition. Motorcyclist arrested at Harbour Bridge crime scene A motorcyclist has also been arrested for allegedly riding through the crime scene at the Harbour Bridge, police say: As emergency services were treating those at the scene, a motorcyclist allegedly rode through the crime scene. He was arrested and taken to Day Street Police Station where he is assisting with inquiries. A second person has died after the crash on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, police say. Emergency services were called to the bridge at about 1.40pm on Thursday, where they found three cars and a bus had collided. Police confirmed one man died at the scene and a second was in a critical condition. In a statement released just now police said a second person had now died: NSW Ambulance paramedics have treated multiple people for injuries; however, two men died at the scene. They have not yet been formally identified. The bus driver was uninjured, and no passengers were on board at the time. Bombshell report reveals systemic bullying and harassment at Nine We mentioned earlier the independent review commissioned by Nine Entertainment was due today. That report is now out and has revealed systemic bullying and harassment \u2013 you can read the full story from Amanda Meade: People \u2018languishing\u2019 in hospital while waiting for NDIS care Hundreds of people with disabilities are \u201clanguishing\u201d in public hospitals while they wait for adequate support, leaving them vulnerable to harm and infection, AAP reports. Workforce shortages and a lack of disability accommodation in rural areas has led to an increase in NDIS participants staying in hospital, the Western NSW Local Health District chief executive, Mark Spittal, said at an inquiry today. NSW hospitals had 294 such people yet to be discharged in early October because no NDIS supports were in place or their assessments had not been finalised. Spittal told the federal inquiry examining the experience of rural NDIS participants in Dubbo that hospitals were the support providers of last resort for people with disabilities: That\u2019s certainly not the place that somebody with a significant disability should be languishing. Their risk of acquiring infection, the risk of being marginalised because the acute care needs of somebody else in the ward will take predominance and, as a result, being unintentionally harmed are very, very high. An NDIS assessment can take several weeks involving a number of health practitioners at a time when GPs in major regional centres had closed their books, he said. If you\u2019re a highly complex person with highly-complex disabilities needing access to primary care and you do not already have a (GP), your chances of being able to execute that are virtually zero. People living with disabilities in small towns were also having to move and leave their families behind to access specialised support, he said. Debris balls getting smaller, EPA says The size of the debris balls vary between a marble and tennis ball, Stephen Beaman from the Environment Protection Authority tells press: We are actually seeing, as we move away from the Coogee area, the size of the balls are getting smaller. Probably getting a lot of wave action in the surf zone, breaking that material up. This post has been updated to correct Stephen Beaman\u2019s name. NSW EPA analysing \u201cquite unusual\u201d tar ball debris The NSW Environment Protection Authority is currently analysing samples of the black ball-shaped debris. Stephen Beaman, EPA\u2019s executive director of regulatory practice and services, confirms their tests results are matching up with those of Randwick city council\u2019s. Speaking from Coogee, Beaman told press: We\u2019ve had our specialists out collecting samples and having these samples analysed by our laboratories. We\u2019re using this information to get further detail on what the nature of the material is, so we can use that to identify the \u2026 sources of contamination. Beaman told press the material \u201cis quite unusual,\u201d and that \u201cit is quite a fibrous material\u201d. He said it has a hydrocarbon base. He said it is too early to predict where it has come from, and clarified that oil can come from both boats and land sources. This post has been updated to correct Stephen Beaman\u2019s name and title. Thanks Emily and good afternoon everyone! Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, I\u2019ll hand over to Natasha May who will be with you for the next little while. Take care. Circling back to the Sydney beach debris Reverse and drift modelling will be used to consider the currents and wind in ascertaining where the black ball-shaped debris is coming from. David Wood from NSW Maritime has told reporters: We are also working with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to find where these contaminants may have come from. They will do reverse modelling and drift modelling, taking into account the currents and wind, for us to be able to work out whether it comes from south, north or east of NSW, to try and give better information on the likely source. Weather agencies warning of severe storms, unsettled weather The Bureau of Meteorology has published a severe weather update, with severe thunderstorms possible throughout central and southern Australia today. The NSW SES has also shared an update, urging people in western parts of the state to prepare for unsettled weather in the coming few days. NSW Maritime says they can\u2019t see any more tar balls drifting towards Sydney beaches NSW Maritime said they have seen no more sheen or balls drifting towards Sydney beaches, after black debris forced the closure of seven beaches. Speaking to reporters from Coogee, David Wood from NSW Maritime said: We\u2019ve been working over the last two days with Port Authority of NSW. We\u2019ve had vessels out on our water. We can ensure that we can\u2019t see any more sheen on that water. We also can\u2019t see any more balls that are drifting in towards the beaches of the city, which is a good sign at the moment. NSW Maritime coordinating response to debris on Sydney beaches Daren Wood, director of NSW Maritime, and Stephen Beaman, executive director of regulatory practice and services for the NSW EPA, have addressed press a short while ago on the thousands of small black balls that have washed up on beaches in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs. Speaking from Coogee, Wood said NSW Maritime is taking coordination of the incident. They will be coordinating with Randwick City Council, EPA, the Port Authority and Australian Maritime Safety. This post has been updated to correct Stephen Beaman\u2019s name and title. Cyber firm says it had to publicly \u2018shame\u2019 X into taking action on China-linked bot network Cybersecurity firm CyberCX has told the Australian parliament it was forced to brief the government and media about a China-linked bot network of 5,000 accounts on X because the company was unable to report it to X directly. The firm announced in August it had identified a network of at least 5,000 inauthentic X accounts almost certainly controlled by an AI large-language model-based system which the firm termed the Green Cicada Network. They assessed that the system was designed, at least in part, to \u2018launder\u2019 politically divisive narratives by rewording organic content as new posts and replies and to amplify organic divisive content on X through engagement. It was primarily focused on US politics and culture but had also amplified hot-button political issues in Australia, the UK and other countries. Speaking before a parliamentary inquiry on the Albanese government\u2019s misinformation and disinformation bill, CyberCX\u2019s executive director of corporate affairs, Jordan Newnham, said CyberCX it was difficult to report all 5,000 accounts to X, and CyberCX had been \u201cbanging our head against the wall\u201d trying to contact X on it, so CyberCX reported the findings to government and then to media \u201cbasically just to shame X into taking action, which it looks like they have.\u201d Newnham said X had suspended some of the accounts, but the so-called \u201cpuppet master\u201d account for the bot network had appeared to delete its own account. He said CyberCX had still yet to hear from X on the matter. Hearing into government\u2019s misinformation bill International bodies voicing concern about issues and developments in Australia could fall afoul of the government\u2019s misinformation bill, the Human Rights Commission has claimed, saying the controversial legislation created \u201cdoubt\u201d over public debates. A hearing into the bill, which is on its second run-through after being introduced then pulled and rewritten following strong public criticism, is being held today in Canberra. Lorraine Finlay, the Human Rights Commissioner, said the AHRC had concerns about how the bill would work. The Coalition has said it will oppose the government\u2019s bill. The Liberal senator Dave Sharma asked Finlay about whether she thought a body like the United Nations or the OECD voicing concerns about economic conditions in Australia, or bleaching of the coral reef, could fall foul of the misinformation laws \u2013 insofar as such claims could cause harm to public confidence in financial markets or have consequences for the Australian community, which are stipulations in the legislation. \u201cPotentially,\u201d Findlay replied. She said there was \u201cdoubt\u201d about how comments from such international bodies would be treated \u2013 \u201cand that doubt is really at the heart of the concerns we have about this legislation, that there isn\u2019t a precision in the definitions that allow for clarity about who is in and who is out.\u201d The idea you\u2019re even creating tiers of speech rights, is problematic from our perspective. Finlay said the AHRC had concerns about the bill creating \u201cuncertainty\u201d over how various institutions could participate in public debate. That uncertainty in our view, the real harm of it, it leads to the potential of over-censorship. Whether that\u2019s by the platforms or indeed by individuals or organisations who might choose not to engage in speech that they otherwise would, because of a concern of whether they would be protected under the legislation or not. Finlay raised concern over the breadth of the definitions in the bill, and what she called \u201cvagueness\u201d of the definitions. Traffic banked up towards Sydney Harbour Bridge Here is a look at the traffic banked up at the Sydney Harbour Bridge. According to Tripview, a route 207 bus is stuck in the traffic. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is closed in both directions following a multi-vehicle, fatal collision this afternoon. Emergency services and Transport for NSW are attending the scene, and a helicopter. Heavy traffic conditions are being reported, with motorists told to expect significant delays, avoid the area and use an alternative route. Motorists can consider using the Sydney Harbour Tunnel in both directions. As we just reported, one person has died at the scene and a second is in a critical condition after the collision, which involved a bus that had no passengers on board at the time. Emergency services are responding to a multi-vehicle collision on Sydney Harbour Bridge. NSW Police said the incident involved three cars and a bus, around 1.40pm, and one person has died at the scene. A second is in a critical condition, police said, with paramedics assessing a number of other patients. The bus driver is uninjured, police said, and no passengers were on board at the time. Eight ambulance resources responded, including a helicopter. Emergency services are still on the scene responding. The NSW Environment Protection Authority has inspected three beaches riddled with black balls and has observed balls at a further eight, taking the total number of affected beaches to 11. EPA officers inspected Coogee Beach, Gordons Bay and Maroubra Beach this morning, all of which are fully or partially closed to the public. Balls were also observed at Bondi, Bronte, Clovelly and Tamarama, which were closed earlier today, as well as Congong, Frenchmans, Little Bay and Malabar. While Randwick council tests suggested the balls contained hydrocarbon, consistent with the makeup of tar balls, the EPA were yet to confirm the balls\u2019 origins and potential risks to the community. In a statement, the agency advised against swimming or touching any balls that may have washed ashore until clean-ups were complete. The EPA encouraged the community to report further ball sitings to the NSW Environment Line on 131 555 or email info@epa.nsw.gov.au. Randwick mayor provides update on beach closures, cannot confirm if they will reopen by weekend The mayor of Randwick council, Dylan Parker, is providing an update on the beach closures, after tar balls washed ashore. As we flagged just earlier, seven beaches across Sydney have now closed as a result. Parker said council was liaising with NSW Maritime and the NSW government. There\u2019ll be more from them later on to say \u2026 but our beaches will remain closed and we\u2019re investigating other beaches along the Randwick local government area \u2026 We had clean-up crews working at Coogee Beach. [It] looks pretty good but we\u2019re still waiting on the tides to come in in order to investigate. It remains under investigation as to what the source of the contaminant is but we\u2019ll update the community as things come to light. He said the \u201capproximately golf-sized black balls\u201d have been washing up onto the shore at Coogee Beach \u201cas recently as this morning\u201d. We don\u2019t currently know what the situation will be on the weekend, but we\u2019re having ongoing conversations \u2026 We\u2019d love to be open, but we\u2019re not in a position to say that just yet. What we like to do is thank the community for their patience while we go through this situation. Shadow workplace relations minister on latest job figures The shadow workplace relations minister, Michaelia Cash, was speaking to reporters from Melbourne just earlier about the latest job figures. She said the 4.1% unemployment rate was \u201cwelcomed by the Coalition\u201d but argued \u201cwhen you look behind the figures, we are now seeing what are incredibly concerning trends.\u201d She said the growth was occurring in the public sector, not the private sector, and that the hours worked was also increased in the public sector but not the private. The public sector jobs growth is now outpacing the private sector and that is because the Albanese government [is] great at creating public sector jobs, but not so good [at] motivating the private sector to create jobs. Nine to hold all staff meeting at 4pm to outline culture review findings All staff from Nine Entertainment\u2019s television and newspaper divisions have been invited to an online briefing at 4pm today at which management will outline the findings of an independent cultural review. It was commissioned after allegations of inappropriate behaviour and broader cultural issues in the television newsrooms were uncovered earlier this year. The majority of the problems have occurred within the Channel Nine newsrooms and not the newsrooms of the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. Acting chief executive officer Matt Stanton told staff the review by Intersection may be a challenging time for employees and confidential support is available. After staff have been briefed the findings will be made public. Stanton replaced Nine\u2019s former chief executive Mike Sneesby who commissioned the review in May. Former television news boss Darren Wick left the business earlier this year after allegations of inappropriate conduct. The Riotact journalist to whom the ACT opposition leader, Elizabeth Lee, gave the middle finger has responded. Journalist Ian Bushnell said he is frustrated at being made the centre of a viral news story, in a post published to Riotact. I was just doing my job. It\u2019s very awkward for a journalist to be at the centre of the story rather than just reporting on it. Bushnell is a former news editor of the Canberra Times and said attacks on journalists were now more common than they were earlier in his career. Trying to attack journalists for just doing their job is something the public should be extremely concerned about. It undermines the democratic process. He also rejected any suggestion of being unprofessional, and said as a journalist he was \u201cthere to ask questions on behalf of the public\u201d. Ms Lee is the only politician I\u2019ve had these sorts of exchanges with. I\u2019m on good terms with everyone else, and I thought I was on good terms with her. Murray Watt says jobs figures \u2018remarkable achievement\u2019 The employment and workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, was speaking in Melbourne earlier about today\u2019s job figures. He welcomed news that gains had lifted the number of extra jobs since the Albanese government took office to more than 1 million, and told reporters: This is the most jobs ever created in a single parliamentary term by any Australian government ever. It\u2019s the first time in Australian history that any government has created more than 1 million new jobs in a single parliamentary term \u2026 This is a remarkable achievement in the context of a slowing economy and a labour market that\u2019s expected to soften. NSW premier on closed Sydney beaches The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said eastern beaches had been closed \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d after tar balls washed ashore this week. He said the public would be kept updated on the investigations being led by the NSW Environment Protection Authority. He said: We need to make sure that we\u2019re fully investigating. It\u2019s an unusual occurrence on Sydney\u2019s beaches. The EPA is leading those investigations. The council is responsible for closing down the beaches. Three more Sydney beaches have been closed \u201cout of precaution\u201d, after mysterious tar balls have washed ashore. Waverly Council said all of its beached were closed to the public today, after it was informed that \u201cpea to marble size balls\u201d were observed by EPA staff on Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches. All beaches in the Waverly LGA would now be closed as a precaution, the council said, until further investigation has been carried out. Mayor Will Nemesh said council would prioritise the safety of the community, and continue to monitor the situation closely: The wellbeing of our community is paramount. That\u2019s why council has taken the precaution to close our beaches. The list of closed Sydney beaches now includes: Clovelly Beach The northern end of Maroubra Beach Coogee Beach Gordons Bay Bondi Beach Tamarama Beach Bronte Beach Aussie shares rally to second all-time high of the week The local share market has set its second all-time high for the week and is on track for its best daily performance in five weeks, AAP reports. At noon Aedt the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 81.4 points, or 0.98%, to 8,366.1, while the broader All Ordinaries had gained 80 points, or 0.93%, to 8,636.6. The ASX200 had been up by as much as 1.2% in late morning trading, but trimmed its gains after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported better-than-expected jobs data for September, with another 64,000 created. Ten of the ASX\u2019s 11 sectors were higher at midday, all except technology. The property sector was the biggest gainer, up 1.4% as Goodman Group advanced 2% and Charter Hall climbed 2.7%. Westpac and NAB were leading the big four banks at midday, both up 1.2%. CBA had added 0.5% and ANZ was 0.7% higher. It was a bit of a more muted day for the heavyweight mining sector. BHP was up 0.2% and Rio Tinto and Fortescue had both climbed 0.3%. The Australian dollar was buying 67.07 US cents, from 66.96 US cents at yesterday\u2019s ASX close. How a \u2018putrid\u2019 find in a museum cupboard could be the key to bringing the Tasmanian tiger back to life Breakthroughs sometimes turn up in unexpected places. The researchers working on the international push to bring back the thylacine say theirs turned up in a long-ignored bucket in the back of a cupboard at a Melbourne museum. It contained an astonishingly well-preserved head of the extinct marsupial, also known as the Tasmanian tiger \u2013 containing material the scientists thought would be impossible to find. The project to bring back the thylacine is being driven by Colossal, a Texas-based biotechnology \u201cde-extinction and species preservation\u201d company that is also aiming to recreate the woolly mammoth and the dodo using genetic engineering techniques. You can read more details about this project, below: Chalmers cheers 1m jobs during Albanese government As we flagged, the Albanese needed about an extra 23,000 jobs from the September data to pass the 1m mark since they took office in May 2022. The 64,100 that were added handily cleared that bar (subject to revisions). Chalmers has chimed in and said: This is the first and only time any government of any political persuasion has overseen the creation of a million new jobs in a single parliamentary term. We welcome the fact that the majority of these million new jobs are full time and around half are for women. For what it\u2019s worth, the comparison look like this (as of last August), so Chalmers\u2019 office put out a month ago: Still, the good news has an aftertaste: the RBA is looking for the jobs market to cool a bit to take out what it sees as excessive demand in the economy before it gets out its interest rate axe. Anyway, you can follow on at home here as well: Map of the Sydney beach closures after tar balls washed ashore Circling back to news that two more Sydney beaches had closed, after tar balls washed ashore. The beaches that are currently closed are: Clovelly Beach The northern end of Maroubra Beach Coogee beach Gordons Bay As Rafqa Touma reported just earlier, the four beaches will be closed until further notice. Greens call on government to fund national anti-racism strategy Senator Mehreen Faruqi, the deputy Greens leader and spokesperson for anti-racism, has called on the government to fund a national anti-racism strategy. This follows the release of a report commissioned by the AHRC, with first-hand accounts revealing racism in Australia was \u201cubiquitous, insidious and profoundly damaging\u201d. (You can read more earlier in the blog here). In a statement, Faruqi said the report shows \u201cracism is entrenched in Australia, and that it is rooted in settler colonialism and whiteness as an ideology and practice.\u201d Racism is rife across society - in government, in the media, in interactions with the police, in workplaces, in playgrounds. For how long will First Nations people and people of colour in this country be subjected to racism before it is acknowledged and systemically tackled by the government? Instead of using \u2018social cohesion\u2019 as a distraction and a way of cracking down on legitimate protests against Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza, Labor must fully fund the AHRC to urgently implement a national anti-racism strategy. The Labor government can start today by mandating anti-racism training for all parliamentarians, to challenge white privilege which is at the core of racism in this country. Two charged after investigation into suspicious fire on northern beaches Two people have been charged after an investigation into an alleged suspicious fire on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches last year, New South Wales Police said. On Monday, police arrested a 21-year-old man in Wauchope in connection to a truck fire in Cromer in April 2023. NSW Fire and Rescue crews extinguished the blaze, but the truck was destroyed. Police established a crime scene and began investigating the incident. In a statement, police said the man was taken to Port Macquarie police station, where he was charged with damage to property by fire/explosive over $15,000. He was granted conditional bail to appear before local in November. A 38-year-old woman was arrested in Cromer yesterday. She was taken to Manly police station, where she was charged with dishonestly destroying or damaging property with a view to making a gain from it. She was refused bail to appear before Manly local court today. Clovelly Beach and the northern end of Maroubra Beach have been closed after tar balls washed ashore overnight. Coogee beach was closed on Tuesday, and Gordons Bay beach was closed on Wednesday, with beachgoers warned not to touch or go near the debris, which preliminary testing shows as a hydrocarbon-based pollutant, but we still don\u2019t know where the balls are coming from. The four beaches will be closed until further notice. Randwick Mayor Dylan Parker said Council would continue to remove the material across all beaches throughout the day: We don\u2019t yet know what has happened to produce the debris washing up on our beaches, but we will continue to work with relevant authorities to ensure the safety of the public and clean up our beaches. Banking outages taking longer to fix, RBA report says Australian consumers and businesses are suffering longer outages for digital payment services, the research from the Reserve Bank of Australia has revealed. As AAP reports, this comes one day after a string of outages hit Westpac and subsidiaries including St George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA, leaving customers unable to access their accounts online. The research, published today, was based on incident reports issued to the RBA from payment providers dating back to 2012, and more detailed statistics starting in 2021. The data detailed significant financial outages lasting longer than 30 minutes. Researchers Jared Griffiths and Matthew Joyce found the number of financial outages in Australia had dropped over the period, but the duration of financial outages had not fallen, with the median length of incidents involving fast money transfers and ATMs lasting more than two hours \u2013 and next-day transfer outages taking almost eight hours to resolve. The report noted that \u201cevery incident or outage can potentially cause inconvenience or economic harm for end-users of those systems.\u201d Given the wide-reaching impact of outages, the effective management of operational risk in the payments system has never been more important. Consumers\u2019 reliance on contactless payments and digital banking had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, RMIT finance senior lecturer Dr My Nguyen said, giving any outage a stronger impact. But Nguyen said in terms of global trends, \u201cAustralia is doing fairly well for reliability.\u201d Any way you slice it, Australia\u2019s labour market has been going gangbusters for most of this year and September turned out to be no exception (despite the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, bracing everyone for a downward arrow). Every state bar South Australia posted a lower jobless rate (seasonally adjusted) compared with August. Among the big economies, Western Australia led the way at 3.6%, down from 3.9%, with New South Wales also back into the \u201c3s\u201d at 3.7% from 4.1%. Queensland, which goes to the polls in a bit over a week, didn\u2019t do too badly either, at 4.1%, easing from 4.2%, and Victoria\u2019s eased by a similar margin to 4.4%. The lowest jobless rate in the land award went to the ACT (which handily goes to the polls this weekend). It fell to 3.4% from 3.8% (cue moaning in some media about government staff levels bulking up). South Australia\u2019s increase to 4.3% from 3.9% in August was the only laggard. As the ABS notes, employment over the past year has risen at 3.1% versus population\u2019s 2.5% growth rate. A generally downbeat NAB survey out at the same time as the jobs figures showed finding staff remains a challenge: Expectations for employment in three and 12 months edged down slightly, but the share of firms reporting availability of labour as a constraint edged back up to 82% (from 79%). In such conditions, shy of a sharply lower inflation result for the September quarter (out from the ABS on 30 October), the RBA looks unlikely to lower its cash rate soon. Perhaps a jump in inflation (though not very likely) might put another rate rise back on the agenda? The LNP candidate for Gregory in the upcoming Queensland election, Sean Dillon, has told 4BC radio he was assaulted and threatened near his home by two people. He alleged he was told \u201cshut your union bashing mouth\u201d by two people, and thrown on the bonnet of his car. Dillon told the station the incident was \u201cterrifying\u201d and \u201cpretty horrific\u201d, occurring 20km from his house after he pulled over to assist someone. I was physically accosted at that point, and it was pretty explicit \u2026 the instructions about what they thought around my continued involvement in politics and what I should or shouldn\u2019t do. Dillon said he was in shock afterwards, because \u201cit was the last thing that you expect as a political candidate\u201d. He said the alleged offenders did not have their faces covered, but were not known to him. Dillon said he has good relationships with various union members, and \u201cthere\u2019s certainly no union bashing when it comes to me\u201d. Queensland police confirmed it received a complaint in relation to an alleged assault on 27 August, around 6.30pm, at the intersection of Eulimbie Road and Clermont Alpha Road in Alpha. Police said investigations are continuing. Stocks pared gains before release of jobs figures Underscoring the strength of the jobs figures and the reduced chance of an early RBA interest rate cut, the Australian dollar jumped about 0.2 of a US cent to US66.9c and stocks pared their gains for the day to 0.85% from 1.15% just before the release of the jobs figures. Job additions should lift total since Albanese took office to more than 1 million Economists had also expected the economy to add a net 25,000 jobs. Instead, more than 51,000 full-time positions alone were added with more than 12,000 part-time roles added as well. Unless there are revisions to previous months\u2019 tallies, the September job additions should lift the total since the Albanese government took office to more than 1 million new jobs. More on the latest job figures The jobless rate for September was 4.1%, lower than the 4.2% rate expected by economists. The ABS also revised lower the August unemployment rate to 4.1%, meaning the month to month rate was unchanged. Australia\u2019s employers added more than 64,000 jobs last month, most of them full-time, making it less likely the Reserve Bank will cut its key interest rate this side of Christmas. More to come. Victorian police are investigating after a three-year-old child was hit by a car in Melbourne earlier this morning. Police believe a vehicle struck the child at the intersection of James Cook Drive and Heatherton Road, in Endeavour Hills, about 8.30am. The three-year-old was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. The driver, a 24-year-old Endeavour Hills man, stopped at the scene and is speaking with police. The exact circumstances surrounding the collision are yet to be established, police said, and the investigation remains ongoing. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. The suspension of The Star Sydney\u2019s licence has been prolonged and millions more handed down in fines, AAP reports, after a second probe into the casino revealed further, significant failings. The casino operator was advised this morning that it was being hit with a $15m fine for the breaches, the NSW Independent Casino Commission announced. Star Entertainment Group had started to clean up its act but huge questions remain around competence and capability, chief commissioner Philip Crawford said. Another extension of its existing Sydney licence suspension and independent manager\u2019s appointment is aimed at protecting employment at the business. Crawford said: We\u2019ve had in our minds for quite some time that the public interest is served around the jobs. If Sydney Star fails, the Star group will fail, and that\u2019s a group that employs 9000-plus people ... it would affect the lives of a lot of people. There\u2019s no coming back if you take the licence away. An independent review into governance and management at the casino must be completed by the end of the financial year. Senior management will be \u201crefreshed\u201d in a bid to reset the leadership group, while conditions around the casino\u2019s licence have been amended. National Gambling Helpline: 1800 858 858 ACT chief minister, deputy prime minister, weigh in on middle finger debacle The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has responded to reports that the opposition leader, Elizabeth Lee, gave a journalist the middle finger yesterday afternoon, ahead of Saturday\u2019s territory election. As AAP reports, Barr has told reporters: Over the course of a campaign you learn a lot about how individuals respond to immense pressure. I can understand that frustration but equally that\u2019s part of the role in government. Every week, you have to make difficult decisions, give press conferences where you are likely to get questions that are uncomfortable, where occasionally if the journalist doesn\u2019t feel you\u2019re answering the question, they may have a follow-up question, or two or three or four. For more on this, including reactions from Richard Marles and Matt Canavan, have a read below: How has a fugitive father hidden his three children for so long? You may have seen reports earlier this month that New Zealand fugitive Tom Phillips and his three children were spotted together for the first time in nearly three years. Just before Christmas 2021, he fled into the wilderness with his children, Ember, now 8, Maverick, now 9, and Jayda, now 11, after a dispute with their mother. The group was spotted earlier in the month on Marokopa farmland, in New Zealand\u2019s Waikato region, after a chance encounter with teenage pig hunters. As Michelle Duff reports, the country is desperate to know where he is and why \u2013 after three winters spent hiding in rugged backcountry with his children \u2013 he hasn\u2019t been caught. You can read more on this below: Victorian opposition slams greyhound motion from Animal Justice Party MP The Victorian opposition spokesperson for racing, Tim Bull, has had a crack at Labor for supporting a motion by Animal Justice party MP Georgie Purcell to introduce further transparency measures for greyhound racing dog deaths. The motion, which passed parliament\u2019s upper house yesterday, will force Greyhound Racing Victoria (GRV) to report how many dogs are killed off track and the reasons for their deaths, as well a breakdown of all rehoming, including dogs sent overseas and interstate. But Bull said the new measures were \u201cunachievable and costly\u201d. He said in a statement: You cannot allow the Animal Justice party, with one MP out of 128, to dictate greyhound governance from the parliament chamber. It is a ridiculous notion. I am stunned the minister would side with an MP who publicly states she wishes to end greyhound racing. He is running with the foxes and hunting with the hounds. GRV already has in place a microchipping program that tracks the location, custody and medical history of Victorian greyhounds throughout their lives, however it has no power to command members of the general public to report a second change of ownership of a pet greyhound. This is not the job of GRV and falls within council pet registration. Apart from being impossible to implement, as GRV simply does not have these powers, it is a process that would come at cost in a period when declining betting turnover is impacting all codes. For more on Purcell\u2019s motion, you can have a read below: Here\u2019s a look at the national forecasts across Australia\u2019s capital cities, from the Bureau of Meteorology: Workplace hearing damage affecting one in 10 Aussies Hearing loss from a workplace incident has affected one in 10 Australians despite most saying ear protection is not necessary, a report has revealed. As AAP reports, Hearing Australia data released today surveyed more than 1,000 people on their experience with, and avoiding, hearing damage. A quarter of respondents said they knew someone who has experienced workplace noise-related damage. Eleven per cent experienced damage from workplace noise themselves, but one in three gave little thought to protecting themselves. Hearing Australia\u2019s principal audiologist Karen Hirschausen said: Many people don\u2019t fully understand the risk to their hearing in a nightclub or concert, and they overestimate the length of time they can spend in these noisy environments without hearing protection before risking hearing damage. When people are in loud environments like this, they [need to] take steps to protect their hearing, such as having regular breaks and moving away from speakers. Hirschausen believes workplace laws that stipulate noise-exposed workers should have their hearing tested when they start work, and then at two-yearly intervals, should be reinforced. People with asthma urged to stay vigilant as thunderstorm asthma season begins next month People with hay fever are urged to stay alert this thunderstorm asthma season which starts in November and mainly affects south-east Australia. According to Prof Jo Douglass from Asthma Australia, many thunderstorm asthma sufferers believe they only suffer from hay fever. In 2016, only a third of the 3,500 who presented at Victorian hospitals with thunderstorm asthma had previously suffered from asthma. Almost nine in 10 had previously had hay fever. She said it was important for hay fever sufferers to recognise symptoms associated with asthma, such as night waking and morning wheezing. Those suffering from asthma and hay fever are encouraged to check pollen levels, ensure their asthma action plan is up to date, use a preventer inhaler and keep hay fever under control. Bureau of Meteorology testing tropical cyclone warning system The Bureau of Meteorology says it will be testing its tropical cyclone warning system today. The routine testing will occur from 10am to 5pm Aedt, marked \u201cTEST\u201d and appearing on the Bureau\u2019s website and weather app. University of Melbourne\u2019s chancellor backs condemnation of actions of some pro-Palestine protesters The University of Melbourne\u2019s chancellor has expressed \u201cfull support\u201d for the vice-chancellor\u2019s condemnation of the actions of some pro-Palestine protesters during a sit-in last week. Last Wednesday, a group of students, staff and alumni occupied the office of a Jewish staff member in a bid for the university to cut their ties with universities in Israel, some masked and wearing Palestinian keffiyehs. Jane Hansen confirmed the university council met on campus on Wednesday as part of its usual cycle of meetings. She said there were no specific items or resolutions about these matters, however council expressed its full support for previous statements made by the vice-chancellor and senior staff in relation to the protest. Around two dozen protesters gathered at the same time on campus, alleging more actions were coming and sit ins were \u201cnot violent\u201d. Hanson said: Intentional acts of antisemitism, intimidation, violence or vilification against members of our community are completely unacceptable, as is any threat to the principles of academic freedom. On Tuesday, deputy vice-chancellors Prof Mark Cassidy and Prof Michael Wesley wrote to staff reiterating international research was \u201cfundamental\u201d to the university and staff and students \u201cmust be free to undertake their work without fear or intimidation\u201d. McBride to have appeal heard next March in bid to have jail sentence thrown out or reduced The former army lawyer David McBride will have his appeal heard next March in a bid to throw out, or reduce, his jail sentence. McBride is serving time in Canberra\u2019s Alexander Maconochie Centre after he was sentenced to five years and eight months for pleading guilty to three charges in November 2023 of stealing commonwealth information and passing that to journalists at the ABC. The material was used as the basis for a 2017 investigative series exposing alleged war crimes by Australian defence force personnel in Afghanistan, titled the Afghan Files. McBride was given a non-parole period of 27 months and will remain in jail until at least August 2026 if his appeal is unsuccessful. His appeal will be heard on 3 March 2025 in the ACT supreme court and is expected to last for a day. McBride\u2019s legal team is seeking to appeal against the convictions and the severity of the sentence on the basis McBride believed it was his duty to release the information in the public interest. McBride\u2019s lawyer, Eddie Lloyd, told Guardian Australia earlier this month McBride will argue he took an oath to serve the country and uphold the rule of law and, for that reason, felt he had \u201ca duty to the public\u201d to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has suggested she will be making a significant announcement on housing soon. Speaking outside parliament this morning, Allan said the lack of affordable housing could be to blame for the nation\u2019s falling birth rate: There are many reasons why women, why families choose to have kids and to have a certain number of kids, and these are really personal decisions. Yes, they are influenced by economic circumstances, whether you can get into a home, whether you can get into a home that\u2019s close to your family supports. This is why building more homes is so important and building them in exactly the locations that Victorians are looking. She said Victorians want to live \u201cclose to where they grew up\u201d but are priced out: Many want to live close to mum and dad or their family networks, so that when they have kids they\u2019ve got that support network around them. Because I can tell you, it takes a village to raise a child. I\u2019m blessed to have my family support me and as we are raising our kids, and that is true for so many Victorians. If you live an hour more away from your family support, that makes it harder and harder, and that\u2019s why building more homes, particularly in and around the suburbs of Melbourne, is so vitally important \u2026 That is why, very soon, I\u2019ll be having a lot more to say about how we are going to do a lot more to build more homes in and around the suburbs of Melbourne. Sticking with the declining birthrate for a moment, and AAP reports a revival of the baby bonus is not being considered by the government. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, told Sunrise the federal government was not considering reintroducing the baby bonus to boost the fertility rate: It\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve been discussing. I\u2019m interested, obviously, in the figures. We want to do what we can to make it easier for families and couples to have children and we are doing that. It is important that we have a sustainable birthrate. The baby bonus was set up by the Howard government and gave $3,000 lump sum payments to new parents of children born from July 2004. The then treasurer, Peter Costello, urged families to \u201chave one for mum, one for dad and one for the country\u201d. Marles said the government was focused on cost-of-living measures for families. Demographer says birthrate below 1.5 would be hard to come back from Demographer Liz Allen from the Australian National University says the declining birthrate figures, released by the ABS yesterday, are \u201chistoric\u201d. As we reported in yesterday\u2019s blog, in 2023 there were 286,998 births registered in Australia, with a total fertility rate of 1.50 babies per woman. The total fertility rate has slowly dropped from 1.86 in 1993. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast earlier, Allen said the figures were \u201cbreathtaking\u201d. It feels like we have hit rock bottom. I mean, these are historic figures, particularly the total fertility rate. What is most concerning to me as a demographer is once we break this 1.5 births per woman threshold, if we go any lower, we\u2019re going to have really great difficulty bringing it back, as other countries around the world have shown. Allen said that this decline is not \u201cnecessarily [happening] by choice\u201d, and that young people are \u201cunlikely to achieve their desired family size.\u201d We\u2019re not talking oodles of children here, we\u2019re talking one or two. The hurdles and barriers to have a much-wanted family are just insurmountable now. We have housing unaffordability, we have job insecurity and economic insecurity more broadly. We\u2019ve got gender inequality and climate change that are really at the front of mind for our young people. Just to some breaking international news this last hour, former One Direction member Liam Payne has died aged 31 after falling from a third-floor hotel room in Buenos Aires. You can read more on this below, with more details to follow: One million jobs created during Albanese government? We\u2019ll know soon Later this morning we\u2019ll get September labour force figures from the ABS, and it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll nudge past the 1-million-extra-jobs mark since the Albanese government came to office in May 2022. Economists\u2019 consensus is the Australian economy added 25,000 jobs last month, enough to keep the unemployment rate at 4.2%. Last month, there was a net increase of 47,500 jobs, although all were part-time roles, with 3,100 full-time jobs lost (prior to ABS revisions). Numbers do get tweaked, but, as of last month, the government could point to 977,700 jobs created since it took office (including about 52,800 in May 2022 itself when they took office three weeks in, if we want to quibble). Before today\u2019s release, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was dampening expectations of a good set of numbers for September: Our labour market is not immune from the weakness in the economy and is softening around the edges. We\u2019ve seen that in a host of data points, including the rise in the unemployment rate and lower average hours in recent months. Some of those data points come from Treasury itself, so perhaps Chalmers is opening some \u201cearly mail\u201d. As always, though, changes to the participation rate (which has been hovering at record highs at 67.1%) could push the unemployment rate up or down. That\u2019s why we tend to focus on the jobs added or lost (and the hours worked) as better guides to what\u2019s going on in the economy. Anyway, watch out for the numbers at 11.30am AEDT. More on Green group estimate of Queensland LNP coal plan Continuing from our last post: Callide unit C, which is 13 years younger than unit B, blew up in 2021, knocking out power to 375,000 homes and businesses. All four Callide units went offline in 2022 due to multiple equipment failures at all of the plants. Energy strategist Clare Silcock said: Coal-fired power stations are increasingly a liability as they age and more renewable energy comes online. The troubled Callide C is a stark example of this, where we\u2019ve seen multiple catastrophic failures, and the private company that owns half of the power plant has gone into administration because they can\u2019t front the costs of keeping coal-fired power stations open. Neighbouring Callide B is also experiencing reliability issues. Over the past three years it\u2019s only been able to operate at 70% capacity due to numerous unit breakdowns, often during summer at times of peak demand. Silcock said the government should simply close the plant as scheduled and spend the money on renewable energy instead. Green group estimates LNP\u2019s keep coal plan would cost $420m a year A Liberal National party pledge to keep a Queensland coal station open beyond its scheduled closure would cost up to $420m a year, according to the Queensland Conservation Council. Callide unit B was built in 1988 and is due to close in 2028. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has pledged to keep coal power \u201cindefinitely\u201d, specifically promising to keep Callide B running longer. Crisafulli said last week the notion you can \u201cturn off Queensland\u2019s baseload power without impacting reliability or people\u2019s hip pocket\u201d by the early 2030s was \u201cfanciful.\u201d The plant made an annual loss of about $60m a year over the past five years, QCC says. Unit B is 100% publicly owned, which means the taxpayer foots the bill. Energy strategist Clare Silcock said the cost would dramatically increase past 2028: The LNP\u2019s comments about keeping Callide B open beyond the end of its life are playing dangerous politics with our energy system. Callide B was designed with a lifespan of 40 years. Keeping it open beyond then could cost Queenslanders up to $420m in 2029 and expose us to higher risks of outages and pollution. More to come in a moment. \u2018More than hurtful words\u2019: Australia\u2019s systemic racism Systemic experiences of racial discrimination at health services, schools, workplaces and when interacting with police have led the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to double down on calls for a National Anti-Racism Framework. As AAP reports, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia (FECCA) consulted with 860 participants for a report, commissioned by the AHRC. Respondents reported feeling that their cultural background affected the quality of health care they received from professionals, while others said they felt unsafe at school due to teachers discriminating. Racism was prevalent regardless of age, sexuality, faith, disability or cultural background, the commission found. Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman said the first-hand accounts revealed racism in Australia was \u201cubiquitous, insidious and profoundly damaging\u201d. The racism described is more than hurtful words being said to someone \u2026 it is systemic, often involving dealings with some level of authority, whose power determines access to opportunities, basic needs, services, or justice. Racism seeps into almost every aspect of people\u2019s lives, and in ways that have become so normalised that victims don\u2019t feel they can talk about it \u2026 everyday racism is hidden in plain sight. The report\u2019s 11 recommendations included the government committing to a whole-of-society anti-racism agenda, with public and private institutions urged to have discrimination policies in place including preventative and redress mechanisms. Overhaul of compensation system for serious crime victims in Victoria announced Victims of serious crime in Victoria will be able to access an additional $25,000 in financial assistance, as part of a major overhaul of the state\u2019s compensation system. The minister for victim support, Enver Erdogan, this morning has announced the victims of crime assistance tribunal, known as Vocat, will be abolished and replaced with a new online financial assistance scheme. Under the new scheme, which comes into effect on 18 November, primary victims of crime will be able to access $60,000 for loss of income, medical, counselling and safety-related expenses, as well as an additional $25,000 in certain circumstances. Secondary victims \u2013 someone who is injured at the scene or witnesses the crime \u2013 and family members of victims will continue to be able to access up to $50,000. The new scheme also removes the harmful practice of pooling $100,000 of financial assistance for families, with compensation awarded to each individual family member. Previous strict definitions around who was considered family have also been scrapped, meaning Aboriginal kinship relations, LGBTQ+ relationships and other family members such as in-laws can apply. Victims will no longer have to go into court to complete the process and are able to choose to receive a recognition statement from the state acknowledging the effects of the crime and expressing condolences. Erdogan said: Going through the court system can be quite traumatic. Vocat operates out of the magistrates court and that can be quite confrontational to be frank, because you might need attend and face your perpetrator. And we\u2019ve heard from victims, especially of domestic violence and sexual violence, how difficult that can be, the anxiety. There\u2019s people that usually have suffered quite considerable physical, mental injuries as a result of the crime, and obviously going to an online-based system is just a lot easier and more straightforward, and that\u2019s the reason why we proceeded down this path, in consultation with victims. Opposition supports donation of tanks to Ukraine The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d a move from the government to donate 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. In a post to X, he wrote: Strongly support the decision to gift 49 M1A1 tanks being retired by the Australian Army to Ukraine. It was crucial to not repeat the mistakes of the Taipan helicopters, which were buried by the Albanese government rather than gifted. The tanks should be delivered asap. Early this year, Australia refused Ukraine\u2019s request to donate its retired fleet of Taipan helicopters \u2013 stating they couldn\u2019t be returned in a flying condition. The fleet was dismantled and buried. Marles\u2019 denies bullying problem in his office Circling back to Richard Marles\u2019 interview on the Today show, where he was asked whether his office has a bullying problem. This comes after Marles\u2019 chief of staff, Jo Tarnawsky, alleges her boss effectively sacked her without warning in a phone call on 30 April, the day after they returned from a challenging but successful visit to Ukraine, for which she says he had credited her. Marles said \u201cno\u201d, his office doesn\u2019t have a bullying problem, and pointed to his statement in parliament last week. Obviously I feel very sad that this situation has got to the point that it has. And as I said last week, you know, Jo Tarnawsky is somebody who I\u2019ve known a long time, who worked with me right back in 2012, and I\u2019m very grateful for the service that she\u2019s provided to me, then and now. You know, this matter is now in the hands of lawyers, which is obviously Jo\u2019s right. And it\u2019s very difficult for me as a result to comment much on it further. An independent review, commissioned by Nine Entertainment after it acknowledged \u201calleged inappropriate behaviour and broader cultural issues\u201d in its television newsrooms, will be released today. The report will examine inappropriate behaviour and a \u201cconcentration of power\u201d at the organisation that has \u201cdamaged the trust and fairness within our television newsrooms\u201d. Nine\u2019s former chief executive Mike Sneesby commissioned the review in May after media reports about how management handled allegations of inappropriate behaviour by former television news boss Darren Wick. News Corp and Nine newspaper reports alleged inappropriate touching of female staff at Nine Entertainment functions, including Christmas parties and the Logies television awards. Wick left the company in March and Sneesby followed in September. South Australia\u2019s shadow minister for women on abortion legislation that was rejected overnight Yesterday, South Australia\u2019s upper house held a conscience vote on legislation that would force women seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days \u2013 an extremely rare occurrence \u2013 to be induced, to deliver the child alive, and keep it or adopt it out. The bill was narrowly defeated with 10 votes opposed to 9 in favour, as Tory Shepherd reports: The state\u2019s shadow minister for women, Michelle Lensink, is a vocal opponent of the bill and had to dash to parliament to vote. She was on leave having chemotherapy, and had believed she had a \u2018pair\u2019 who would sit out the vote so as to not affect the result. At the last minute MLC Dennis Hood stepped in to pair her. Speaking to ABC RN this morning about what happened, she said: It was quite bizarre, and I think it just shows how desperate \u2026 some people can be in this debate \u2026 it\u2019s just a terrible piece of legislation. As for how close the vote ended up being, Lensink said: \u201cthat\u2019s sort of margin that we have on conscience votes in the Legislative Council at the moment\u201d. Asked about what alliances occurred within the parliament around this, she said: There\u2019s a lot of, particularly women, who work together, who understand that these are not simple choices that other women make when they go through them, that they\u2019re very challenging \u2026 We know people\u2019s circumstances who\u2019ve been through this. So, you know, we work to try and make sure that that is respected and that the parliament understands that these are decisions that people have to make with the advice of their doctors and midwives, and they shouldn\u2019t have the parliament sort of sticking its nose in randomly at the most stressful point properly in their entire lives. Marles again asked about PM\u2019s property purchase Richard Marles was up on the Today show earlier, and was asked about the prime minister\u2019s $4.3m property purchase \u2013 which has made headlines this week amid the cost of living crisis. Marles defended the move and said Anthony Albanese is \u201centitled to his own personal affairs and his own private life, and obviously the property that he and his partner purchased sit in that domain\u201d. I don\u2019t think Australians are going to be particularly interested in that. I think what Australians are interested in is what the prime minister does when he comes to work. In the final days leading up to the ACT election this Saturday, the opposition leader, Elizabeth Lee, has made headlines for giving a journalist the middle finger. Lee, who is the leader of the Canberra Liberals, had a tense exchange with a reporter during a press conference yesterday, telling them: \u201cI will answer the question in my own way Ian [Bushnell], you don\u2019t get to dictate how I answer the question.\u201d She is then seen walking away, before suddenly turning back to the camera and \u201cflipping the bird\u201d. ABC reported the full exchange \u2013 regarding the costs of her party\u2019s policies \u2013 as follows: Bushnell: \u201cI just want you to answer the question.\u201d Lee: \u201cAre you finished?\u201d Bushnell: \u201cI am, answer the question.\u201d Lee: \u201cAre you finished or not? I will answer the question in my own way Ian. You don\u2019t get to dictate how I answer the question.\u201d Bushnell: \u201cOK.\u201d As the ABC reports, Lee apologised later that afternoon and said she had a \u201chistory with this journalist\u201d, who is from RiotACT. Earlier, I engaged in poor behaviour that was unprofessional, and I apologise \u2026 I respect the work that journalists do, including asking the tough questions, and I think that I have demonstrated during this term that I\u2019m willing to step up and answer tough questions. I don\u2019t excuse my behaviour. It was poor behaviour and I am disappointed in myself and, in a moment of frustration, I did let the emotional side of my reaction get the better of me. Thunderstorm risk over most of South Australia today Miriam Bradbury said there was widespread risks of thunderstorms through much of southern and south-eastern Australia today: The severe storm risk today covers pretty much the entire state of South Australia, including the Adelaide area. But it also catches states on this border area of South Australia too. She said severe thunderstorms may occur across southern inland Western Australia, inland New South Wales and parts of Victoria, bringing damaging winds, large hail and heavy falls, \u201cor a combination of all three\u201d. Super cell thunderstorm over Casterton in Victoria, with tennis ball-size hail Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology was speaking with ABC News Breakfast earlier, about the thunderstorms that have lashed the south-east coast in recent days. She said storms throughout multiple states intensified through the afternoon and evening yesterday, with \u201cvery significant storms\u201d in western Victoria. She pointed to the town of Casterton in the Horsham area, which experienced a super cell thunderstorm. That did bring some incredibly heavy downpours. We had 22mm in 20 minutes at Casterton, which is a lot of rainfall to happen in a very short space of time, as well as very large hail, pushing up towards tennis ball size and some very strong and gusty winds. She said super cell storms are \u201csort of one step up from severe thunderstorms, which are a couple of steps up from everyday thunderstorms in the first place\u201d. Severe Weather Australia has shared some images of the giant hail and thunderstorm damage across Casterton here. Richard Marles questioned on declining birthrate data Richard Marles was also asked about new figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing a declining birthrate. As we reported in yesterday\u2019s blog, in 2023 there were 286,998 births registered in Australia, with a total fertility rate of 1.50 babies per woman. The total fertility rate has slowly dropped from 1.86 in 1993. The decline is most prominent among women aged 15 to 19, the ABS said, while the age-specific fertility rate of women aged 40 to 44 years has almost doubled in 30 years. Responding to the figures, Marles said this is why \u201cwe are focused on the sorts of costs of living pressures that impact families, so that we can do what we can to make it more affordable for people to raise a family\u201d. We know people are doing it tough, and are not for a moment are we saying that the job is done here \u2026 We understand that we want people to be able to meet their dreams and aspirations in terms of having a family. Our reporter Tory Shepherd has taken a look at plummeting birthrates worldwide, which you can read more on below in these two pieces: Richard Marles on donation of tanks to Ukraine The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, was on ABC News Breakfast earlier and also spoke to the donation of 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. He said: We know this will be a conflict that goes for a long time. We are in there for the long haul. This will not be the last package that we provide to Ukraine, as we have consistently said. And we\u2019ll stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes for Ukraine to resolve its conflicts on its own terms. Asked about concerns that Donald Trump may reduce support for Ukraine if elected as US president, Marles said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot at stake\u201d. We cannot allow to stand the idea that a large country can invade a smaller nation, not by reference to international law but reference to power and might. We stand with the international community in terms of supporting Ukraine, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And obviously, what plays out in America is a matter for the American people. But it really matters that the global community continue to support Ukraine in its fight. Conroy provides more detail on donation of 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, has been speaking with ABC RN after the announcement Australia would donate 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. You can read more about this earlier in the blog from Daniel Hurst, here. Asked what changed, after the Albanese government initially indicated a donation wouldn\u2019t occur, Conroy said: We were talking with the Ukrainian government about their priorities and they made clear this is one of their priorities \u2026 Another important factor was the delivery of our new M1A2 tanks beginning in the middle of this year that free up these tanks to be released to Ukraine. So this is part of a broader process, and there are other checks and balances \u2013 including support from the United States \u2013 for the transfer of this equipment. Conroy couldn\u2019t disclose when the tanks would be delivered due to \u201coperational security\u201d. Asked if the tanks were safe for use, he said Australia was talking with Ukraine about whether \u201csome of these tanks will require some modifications to be fixed for battlefield\u201d. We\u2019ve made it very clear that we\u2019re unwavering in our support for the people of Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s unprovoked and illegal war, and we\u2019ve made it very clear that we\u2019ll be supporting Ukraine as long as it takes for them to end the war on their terms and to maintain pressure on Russia. People held on Nauru moved into community, struggling with everyday costs Caseworkers with the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre say the \u201cmajority\u201d of people held in closed detention on Nauru have recently been moved into the community \u2013 however are struggling with the cost of everyday essentials. According to a statement from the ASRC, those in the community are allocated $230 per fortnight to survive on. About 39 people are living in \u201ca complex similar to a detention centre and must share one small, office-sized kitchen\u201d, the centre said, while transportation is posing a barrier for those in more remote areas. The ASRC is calling on the government to urgently evacuate all people held on Nauru for medical care and support while they wait for protection claims to be processed. Its deputy chief executive, Jana Favero, said: People should never have been sent to Nauru in the first place \u2026 The harm of offshore detention is well documented and will continue until we stop outsourcing our moral responsibility and honour our refugee convention obligations. Mohammad Bashir Anjum, who is currently held on Nauru, said \u201cour mental health is not good and we rely on medicines to live our daily life\u201d. There is no certainty about the future and what may happen to us. With the small financial allowance no one can afford three meals a day \u2026 We have spoken to authorities to request an increase in the financial allowance, and our requests were ignored. You can read more on this, from June, below: New polling from the Australia Institute shows that Australians view the supermarkets as \u201cpublic enemy No 1\u201d in the cost of living crisis. The Australia Institute\u2019s Centre for Future Work surveyed 1,014 voters, and 83% said supermarkets deserve some blame \u2013 or a great deal of blame \u2013 for the soaring cost of living. It puts the supermarkets ahead of energy companies on 82%, banks at 73%, and the government on 71%. Sixty per cent of voters said groceries had the most notable cost increase \u2013 far ahead of the next highest result of utilities at 21%. Sixty-four per cent said they supported increasing supermarket competition. Centre For Future Work senior researcher and report co-author Lisa Heap said the results were \u201cemphatic.\u201d Australians are pointing the finger squarely at supermarkets as public enemy No 1 in the cost-of-living crisis \u2026 More people blame supermarkets for the cost-of-living crunch than governments or banks. The public\u2019s appetite for increased supermarket competition is unmistakable. Nearly two-thirds of voters see it as crucial for alleviating cost-of-living pressures \u2026 There\u2019s likely to be political rewards for taking actions that increase supermarket competition. The cost of living crisis means people are spending less on essential services, the survey also found, with 37% spending less on heating/cooling their home, 29% spending less on healthy food and 26% less on seeing a doctor. King Charles to arrive in Australia tomorrow Tomorrow, King Charles will touch down in Australia. The six-day tour will take in Sydney and Canberra and is the first visit by a sitting monarch in 13 years. But not everyone is excited. Reporter Kate Lyons tells Matilda Boseley how the King\u2019s visit has reignited the republic debate \u2013 even if the government seems to have given up on the idea. Commonwealth Bank has paid a $7.5m fine after the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) found the bank had sent over 170m emails that did not comply with Australian spam laws. The Acma investigation found that between November 2022 and April 2024, CBA had sent over 170m marketing messages to Australians that did not include a way to unsubscribe. Acma found that 34.8m of these messages were also sent to people who either had not consented or had withdrawn their consent to receive these messages. It follows a $3.55m fine against CBA in May last year over 65m emails that did not have working unsubscribe arrangements. Acma chair, Nerida O\u2019Loughlin, said: Australians are sick and tired of this kind of spam intruding on their privacy and it\u2019s clear CBA did not have its systems in order. The rules are clear, if a message includes marketing content or direct links to marketing content, it is a commercial message and must give people the option to unsubscribe. The confusion often lies for businesses in whether messages sent to customers are considered commercial (which would require an unsubscribe option) or non-commercial. Acma has also accepted a three-year court-enforceable undertaking from CBA to address the issues. A spokesperson for CBA said the bank apologised for sending the non-compliant messages, and accepted the findings of the investigation: Timely and relevant information for our customers is incredibly important, and the way we classify that information to meet our regulatory requirements and customer expectations is an absolute priority. We are committed to meeting our obligations and we\u2019re dedicating significant time and resources to this. More on the joint union\u2019s statement Yesterday\u2019s rift between trade union factions coincided with a forum between building and construction contractors and unions and governments on challenges for the sector. At yesterday\u2019s meeting, the National Construction Industry Forum agreed to develop a blueprint for reform due to be delivered in six months\u2019 time. The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, said \u201cworking together to address the persistent challenges facing this industry is key to ensuring it is an industry that works for everyone\u201d. Watt later told ABC radio he didn\u2019t believe there was a divide in the trade union movement at all. Watt said: There is no doubt whatsoever that the overwhelming majority of unions and union members support action being taken to clean up the CFMEU. I think that the union movement generally acknowledges that it has been very damaging for the union movement as a whole to have a small number of people within the union movement bring disgrace on the union movement and the very good work that unions do for Australians. Asked whether the split would present issues with the federal government\u2019s reform, Watt said he was \u201cgoing to get on with it\u201d. We\u2019re going to get on with cleaning up the CFMEU Construction Division and developing a construction industry that works for everyone. If other people want to go and have other meetings, that\u2019s fine. But I\u2019m more convinced than ever, having spoken to the ACTU national executive, that the union movement supports change. A group of more than 20 trade unions have defied the Albanese government\u2019s attempts to overhaul unions within the construction industry after allegations of corruption and criminal links made against the CFMEU earlier this year. Yesterday afternoon, the National Building Industry Group of Unions condemned the federal Labor government for placing the embattled union under administration. In a statement, the group said the CFMEU had been denied \u201cbasic natural justice\u201d in a trial by parliament and the media. The statement continued: If a government can legislate outcomes for one union, then all unions are at risk. A union belongs to its members. Union members and their democratically elected leaders decide the future of their union, not knee-jerk legislation. The group, which includes leaders from the CFMEU, and the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union (CEPU), will hold a Trade Unions for Democracy Summit in December to discuss proposals for the creation of an alternative to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), which has backed the government\u2019s response to allegations against to the CFMEU. And happy Thursday \u2013 thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. I\u2019m Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be taking you through our rolling coverage today. As always, you can reach out with any tips or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Four independent crossbenchers will introduce a bill to establish a whistleblower protection authority when Parliament resumes next month. Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie will introduce the proposal, supported by crossbench colleagues Helen Haines, David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie, to create a new body that will support federal whistleblowers, investigate potential retaliation by employers, and ensure disclosures are properly handled. The private member\u2019s bill will come almost a year-and-half after the National Anti-Corruption Commission first opened its doors, and more than a year after the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, confirmed a protection body was one of a number of options under consideration. Dreyfus has previously said the government is \u201ccommitted to ensuring that Australia has effective protections for whistleblowers\u201d. But Wilkie said the introduction of a standalone protection body was \u201clong overdue\u201d. The government must end the war against whistleblowers by supporting my bill. Only then can we ensure whistleblowers are protected, not punished, prosecuted or imprisoned. The crossbenchers are urging the major parties to support the bill. The announcement coincides with a hearing in the ACT supreme court this morning to determine when former army lawyer David McBride \u2013 who is considered by some to be a war crimes whistleblower \u2013 will be able to have his appeal heard. McBride was jailed in May for five years and eight months after pleading guilty to three charges in November 2023 of stealing commonwealth information and passing that to journalists at the ABC. The documents formed the basis of the 2017 investigative series exposing alleged war crimes by Australian defence force personnel in Afghanistan, titled the Afghan Files. Big business is urging the federal government to change zoning laws to allow more housing development close to infrastructure and services as part of a push to force a greater focus on increasing housing supply. Before publishing a report next week examining the housing supply challenge, the Business Council of Australia has proposed a program of land rezoning and changes to generate greater consistency in zoning laws across the states and territories. The BCA chief executive, Bran Black, said: We need state and territory governments to unlock more land for homes in cities and towns across Australia so we can fix this supply crisis. These changes need to allow for greater density and height near good transport services, while at the same time protecting the quality of life, green space and heritage of an area. He said there should be more streamlined processes for home builders to put forward their own proposals to boost housing supply thorough rezoning. The BCA is also calling for what it describes as a \u201ccompetition payment\u201d to create incentives for housing development. Earlier this week, the BCA called for local councils to be forced to set, and abide by, deadlines for making decisions on housing development applications, to ease what it argued had become a bottleneck at the local government level. Australia will donate 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, the federal government has announced. The donation is in addition to previously announced support, which included 120 Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles. Government figures indicate the value of the 49 M1A1 Abrams tanks is about $245m in total. It means that the total value of Australia\u2019s military assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of the country has topped $1.3bn. When non-military support is included, Australia\u2019s overall support to Ukraine is valued at $1.5bn to date. The minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, will represent Australia at the Nato defence ministers\u2019 meeting in Brussels this week. Australia is not a member of Nato but Conroy is expected to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart. Conroy said in a statement that the tanks would \u201cdeliver more firepower and mobility to the Ukrainian armed forces, and complement the support provided by our partners for Ukraine\u201d. The 49 tanks to be donated are near the end of their life. Sources said this meant that a small number of these tanks may need to be fixed by Australia before being delivered. Alternatively, the Australian government has offered to deliver all of the tanks quickly and Ukraine could use the ones with issues for spare parts. It will be left to Ukraine to decide which option to take up. The Australian army, meanwhile, is expected to retain a small number of M1A1 Abrams tanks to assist the transition and introduction of the new M1A2 fleet. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said: Australia\u2019s support for Ukraine has not wavered since Russia\u2019s illegal invasion, and Australia will continue standing with Ukraine. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it\u2019ll be Emily Wind. In a boost to Ukraine\u2019s war effort \u2013 as its president presents a new military strategy dubbed a \u201cvictory plan\u201d against Russia \u2013 Australia has offered Ukraine almost all of its Abrams tanks, which were due to retire next year. More on this soon. The South Australian bill to change the law on later terminations was narrowly defeated in the state\u2019s upper house last night. By the narrowest margin of 10 votes to nine, the upper house last night voted to reject legislation that would force women seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days \u2013 an extremely rare occurrence \u2013 to be induced, to deliver the child alive, and keep it or adopt it out. Anthony Albanese may face renewed backbench pressure to ease capital gains tax concessions, as Labor MPs privately express dismay at his decision to buy a $4.3m waterfront home on the New South Wales Central Coast before an election in the middle of a housing crisis. Meanwhile, big business is urging the federal government to change zoning laws to allow more housing development close to infrastructure and services as part of a push to force a greater focus on increasing housing supply. More coming up. The most prominent republicans concede the challenges they face to have an Australian head of state, but also claim the arrival this week of King Charles and Queen Camilla may be the shot in the arm their campaign needs. We have a full report and analysis, plus our Full Story podcast on the subject. And a group of building industry unions say they plan an alternative to the ACTU as they unite to reject Labor\u2019s crackdown on the CFMEU. More on that also coming up.",

The law would apply to material that is \u201creasonably verifiable as false, misleading or deceptive and reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm\u201d. That includes harm to individuals, such as vilification, or public health and order. The Coalition has already vowed to oppose the bill on freedom of speech grounds. It is now before a parliamentary inquiry before potential amendments and debate on the bill. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email While the News Corp\u2019s columnists and TV show hosts are regularly criticising the bill in columns and on air \u2013 Peta Credlin this week told viewers to \u201csay goodbye to the right of dissent\u201d \u2013 the company\u2019s corporate comments to the parliamentary inquiry on the bill were more circumspect. The proposed bill excludes professional news content from being considered as potential misinformation or disinformation \u2013 including content produced on news websites. News Corp Australia\u2019s group executive corporate affairs, Campbell Reid, told the parliamentary committee examining the bill in a hearing on Thursday that the company\u2019s websites host a range of content \u201cnot just pure journalism reporting\u201d. Reid used examples including puzzles, videos and reader comments, which the company is concerned would mean it was treated as a connected media service or a content aggregation service under definitions in the bill. \u201cWe are anxious that by, say, allowing comments on our news coverage, we don\u2019t therefore become a media sharing service and therefore our exemption falls by the wayside,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re anxious to preserve that the entirety of what we produce under our provisional news mastheads, is exempt, not just parts of.\u201d Reid said despite the commentary appearing on News Corp platforms, the company supports the \u201coriginal and pure intention of what the bill is trying to achieve\u201d, although remained concerned about it in its current form. He said News Corp commentators \u201chave strident views one way or another and as at the heart of this bill is free speech, they are entitled to their views.\u201d Reid said News Corp is regulated and people can make complaints to bodies like the Press Council over errors or issues. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young questioned whether there were any consequences for patterns of behaviour. \u201c[Sky News host] Rita Panahi seems to stuff it up all the time. And whether that\u2019s deliberate or just stupidity, I don\u2019t know, but she seems to get stuff wrong all the time,\u201d Hanson-Young said. \u201cThat\u2019s your view. And I\u2019m aware that there was a recent mistake made,\u201d Reid replied, referring to Sky News recently reporting false news from X accounts twice. But Reid said the information was corrected as quickly as possible. Reid said that \u201cmisinformation and disinformation\u201d had become an all-in-one slogan that has \u201cbeen hijacked by many people in politics\u201d to throw a word around when they\u2019ve read something they disagree with. \u201cI personally think we should start again and look at some of the evidence that you\u2019ve heard today about the actual harmful content that is being published and disseminated with the deliberate intention of causing harm to society, not just a view that you might disagree with, or a mistake that a journalist might make in covering a story.\u201d The Press Council also expressed concern that the definition of news content under the bill was too narrow. \u201cAn opinion piece about a historical event would not fall within the definition of \u2018reporting\u2019, \u2018investigating\u2019 or \u2018explaining\u2019 on a \u2018current\u2019 issue or event. A letter to the editor expressing the opinion of a reader would not fall within the definition of \u2018reporting\u2019, \u2018investigating\u2019 or \u2018explaining\u2019,\u201d the council stated in a written submission. \u201cThe Press Council believes the simplest means of addressing this issue is by excluding from the bill\u2019s coverage all material published by Press Council members.\u201d The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties treasurer, Stephen Blanks, told the hearing it didn\u2019t believe that news content should be exempt from the bill. The Australian Human Rights Commissioner, Lorraine Finlay, told the hearing that the definitions around what is serious harm or misinformation or disinformation in the legislation were too vague and placed too big a burden on freedom of speech. The commission has recommended against passing the bill in its current form.",

Defended on two sides by river channels and with a commanding position over rich agricultural land and abundant water springs, the town, less than an hour north of Rome, has been a witness and a contributor to history for over two millennia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/embed-6-zip/giv-4559wUadFRpwSSg0/\" data-alt=\"Nepi map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/embed-6-zip/giv-4559wUadFRpwSSg0/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Much of that history has been marked by intrigue, violence and war. Most famously, Nepi was ruled by the 15th-century Spanish cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who gave it to his daughter Lucrezia after he became Pope Alexander VI. Lucrezia stayed at the fortress (today known as the Borgia Castle) following the murder of her second husband in 1500. These days, things are a lot more laid-back. I\u2019m sitting outside the Bar Centrale in the town\u2019s elegant Piazza del Comune, facing the imposing town hall, built on the orders of the Farnese family after they took up residence here in the mid-1500s. With me is Paolo Paoletti, who has just been elected for a second term as Nepi\u2019s councillor responsible for culture and tourism. While I sip an espresso and tuck into a cream-filled pastry, Paolo tells me about his plans to develop tourism here and across the Tuscia region.</p> <p>Once the land of the Etruscans, Tuscia roughly corresponds to what is now northern Lazio. Nepi lies at its heart, about 31 miles (50km) from the capital. Paolo\u2019s ambition is to connect it with other local towns to create a tourism network that will enable visitors to experience Tuscia\u2019s historical, cultural and natural attractions. The development of a <a href=\"https://www.nepeasy.it/\">web portal</a> is a first step. This will position Nepi as the hub of what Paolo laughingly calls \u201cTuscialand\u201d. But he is also conscious of the need to protect Tuscia\u2019s relaxed, traditional way of life from waves of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/31/venice-cuts-size-of-tourist-parties-to-25-to-reduce-impact-on-city\">invasive tourism</a> that have recently overwhelmed many Italian towns and cities. Nepi\u2019s 50-plus <a href=\"https://www.proloconepi.it/dove-dormire\">B&amp;Bs and short-stay apartments</a> are small-scale affairs run by local people, and Paolo wants them to stay that way. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get the understanding and support of the community,\u201d he says, \u201cso that visitors feel welcome but residents don\u2019t feel threatened.\u201d</p>    <p>I\u2019m staying in a palatial 18th-century apartment, conveniently located above the Bar Centrale.

Nearby is a portrait of Saint Romanus, who, along with Ptolemy, is the town\u2019s patron saint. But Romanus\u2019s face is that of Reginald Pole, \u201cBloody\u201d Mary Tudor\u2019s distant cousin and archbishop of Canterbury during her attempted Catholic reconversion of England. In Henry VIII\u2019s reign (in 1532) Pole went into exile in Rome, where he was made a cardinal and given the governorship of <a href=\"https://civitadibagnoregio.cloud/\">Bagnoregio</a>, the so-called \u201cdying town\u201d perched precariously on top of an eroding hill.</p>    <p>The English have been coming here for centuries: first, as pilgrims on their way to Rome; then as grand tourists.

      "bodyText": "Standing on the top of the huge fortress, looking over the rolling landscape, it\u2019s easy to see why Nepi was a prized possession for Roman emperors, medieval popes and Renaissance dynasties. Defended on two sides by river channels and with a commanding position over rich agricultural land and abundant water springs, the town, less than an hour north of Rome, has been a witness and a contributor to history for over two millennia. Much of that history has been marked by intrigue, violence and war. Most famously, Nepi was ruled by the 15th-century Spanish cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who gave it to his daughter Lucrezia after he became Pope Alexander VI. Lucrezia stayed at the fortress (today known as the Borgia Castle) following the murder of her second husband in 1500. These days, things are a lot more laid-back. I\u2019m sitting outside the Bar Centrale in the town\u2019s elegant Piazza del Comune, facing the imposing town hall, built on the orders of the Farnese family after they took up residence here in the mid-1500s. With me is Paolo Paoletti, who has just been elected for a second term as Nepi\u2019s councillor responsible for culture and tourism. While I sip an espresso and tuck into a cream-filled pastry, Paolo tells me about his plans to develop tourism here and across the Tuscia region. Once the land of the Etruscans, Tuscia roughly corresponds to what is now northern Lazio. Nepi lies at its heart, about 31 miles (50km) from the capital. Paolo\u2019s ambition is to connect it with other local towns to create a tourism network that will enable visitors to experience Tuscia\u2019s historical, cultural and natural attractions. The development of a web portal is a first step. This will position Nepi as the hub of what Paolo laughingly calls \u201cTuscialand\u201d. But he is also conscious of the need to protect Tuscia\u2019s relaxed, traditional way of life from waves of invasive tourism that have recently overwhelmed many Italian towns and cities. Nepi\u2019s 50-plus B&amp;Bs and short-stay apartments are small-scale affairs run by local people, and Paolo wants them to stay that way. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get the understanding and support of the community,\u201d he says, \u201cso that visitors feel welcome but residents don\u2019t feel threatened.\u201d I\u2019m staying in a palatial 18th-century apartment, conveniently located above the Bar Centrale. Owners Alessia and Francesco already run the Loft Delle Scalette on the other side of the piazza, and they are planning to offer this three-bedroomed space for tourist accommodation early next year. After a second cream pastry, Paolo whisks me off to the neighbouring town of Castel Sant\u2019Elia. We make the short journey by car, but we could easily have walked the two miles. Across Tuscia there are paths, trails and ancient Roman roads ideal for walking, trekking and cycling. With plenty of sunshine and temperatures reaching a comfortable 20C, early autumn is the perfect time to explore the region\u2019s impressive landscape and to spot wildlife such as porcupines, wild boars, peregrine falcons and black kites. Nepi itself is edged on two sides by a deep gorge formed by river channels running through the volcanic rock of the Cimini and Sabatini Hills. Beyond, the expansive and undulating countryside is carpeted with fields and woods, and criss-crossed with streams and waterfalls. One of the trails takes you through the Suppentonia valley to Castel Sant\u2019Elia\u2019s 11th-century basilica, where we meet Paolo\u2019s opposite number, councillor Cecilia Paolucci. She points out a fresco filled with scenes from the Apocalypse of Saint John. The saint is associated with the winter solstice, and every year at dawn on 21 or 22 December sunlight enters each of the high windows on the left of the basilica, creating a mystical illumination. A different kind of wonder is on offer at the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, about 12 miles to the south. Towering over the town and the surrounding volcanic hills, the villa was built by the Farneses as a statement of their wealth and power. The interiors are covered with frescos glorifying the dynasty, while the sprawling gardens include a monumental cascade, an eerie hedge-and-statue quadrangle and a wooded secret garden.

      "body": "<p>At first glance it was a low-key sort of day at the stadium formerly known as Twickenham. The weather was unseasonably warm for mid-October and a sleepy fox was snoozing on the porch of a temporary building in the north car park. Inside England duly announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/16/henry-slade-england-squad-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union\">a wholly predictable squad</a>, almost as if Steve Borthwick was doing his best to avoid stealing any of Thomas Tuchel\u2019s thunder.</p> <p>Borthwick also politely knocked back the invitation to pass on any tips to the incoming German \u2013 \u201che has plenty of experience in English sport already\u201d \u2013 beyond matter-of-factly quoting the well-known stat about international teams with homegrown coaches doing better in major tournaments. He preferred to leave it to others, too, to observe that across men\u2019s English cricket, football and rugby union he will soon be the solitary home -produced head honcho left.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/16/henry-slade-england-squad-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union\">Borthwick confident of adding Morrow to England staff at end of season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even so, there was no avoiding the inevitable enquiries regarding his own assistant coaches which soon followed. Until now Borthwick had chosen to stay silent on the abrupt summer departure of two of his key managerial sidekicks, Felix Jones and Aled Walters. Here, finally, was a chance to tell the world it was very much their loss and that the pair would bitterly regret their decisions.</p> <p>Or, at least, that is what a straight-talking Teutonic leader might have done. Or, come to that, his immediate predecessor, Eddie Jones. Eddie\u2019s mood would have instantly darkened and a confrontational edge \u2013 \u201cWhat are you implying, mate?\u201d \u2013 would have swiftly surfaced. Borthwick, by contrast, resembled a man who has been kicked somewhere painful and still cannot entirely understand why.</p> <p>Which is the exact same question with which sizeable chunks of the English public are still wrestling. If (the stadium formerly known as) Twickenham is such a wonderful place to work, why did two of Borthwick\u2019s most highly rated lieutenants suddenly jump ship? Ignore for a moment that Jones is Irish and Walters is Welsh \u2013 pearl-clutching patriotism only appears to be fully ignited by arrivals from continental Europe \u2013 and the quick-fire defections do not seem a total coincidence.</p> <p>What is now a matter of record is that Borthwick did not see either coming. \u201cThe two of them are close, but it was still disappointing and surprising. I hadn\u2019t anticipated it.\u201d Really? If so there would usually be one of three conclusions. The first is that the England working environment is so stiflingly intense that unhappy employees felt unable to speak honestly and openly about their personal misgivings. The second is that they sense there is more chance of winning trophies elsewhere. And the third? That Borthwick\u2019s managerial antennae are not picking up certain \u201csoft\u201d signals that world-class coaches normally spot a mile away.</p>    <p>Admittedly, there is one other possible explanation: that Borthwick has simply been unlucky. But Jones resigned without another job to go to and is being required to work remotely while serving his notice, which can be filed under \u201cnaughty boy nets\u201d or \u201csmall-minded pettiness\u201d depending on your viewpoint. Then again, given Jones is the chief architect of England\u2019s shiny new defensive system, the last thing the Rugby Football Union wants is to see him hunched over a laptop in a rival coaching box next month.</p> <p>Either way, Borthwick could have done with drawing a heavy line under it all this week. Unfortunately for him he has been unable to do so, the Premiership clubs having understandably blocked a proposed job-share deal which would have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/16/henry-slade-england-squad-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union\">the respected Phil Morrow</a> serve both England, who have a performance management role earmarked for him, and Saracens.</p> <p>It would instead appear that Morrow, who would need to be bought out of a very lucrative long-term contract at Sarries, will not be in a red rose tracksuit before next summer at the earliest. With Kevin Sinfield\u2019s role now more part-time and the new defence coach Joe El-Abd still working in France at Oyonnax, Borthwick\u2019s backroom team is at risk of resembling one of those frustratingly incomplete Ikea wardrobes which always seem to be missing one or two crucial screws.</p> <p>No wonder Borthwick was keen to project a steady-as-she-goes message. \u201cWe want to see the drama on the pitch ... when we see stuff happening off the pitch it\u2019s characterised sometimes as drama. But, for me, we have quite a stable coaching team [comprising] guys I\u2019ve worked with for a period of time now.\u201d</p> <p>The truth, though, is that it is not merely the players who could do with two or three resounding victories next month to prove all is fine and dandy.</p> <p>With Jamie George reconfirmed as captain the primary aim, accordingly, is to turn a string of narrow defeats this year into morale-lifting wins. \u201cIn each of those games we have been winning at some stage,\u201d stressed Borthwick. \u201cIf you include the Ireland game here there has been a key penalty and a key kick that has caused the result either to go for us or against us. As this team develops and matures, then I think we will understand [how to] close those games and finish&nbsp;the&nbsp;job.\u201d</p> <p>Which, of course, is precisely what earns top sporting alchemists their corn. Borthwick\u2019s team made encouraging on-field progress on their summer tour and the quality of the squad is perhaps best illustrated by some of the talent omitted from it.</p> <p>But as Herr Tuchel and Borthwick will doubtless agree when they do meet, clarity is everything when it comes to a team\u2019s long-term identity. And, regardless of the head coach\u2019s nationality, off-field uncertainty&nbsp;is&nbsp;rarely a recipe for sustained success on it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At first glance it was a low-key sort of day at the stadium formerly known as Twickenham. The weather was unseasonably warm for mid-October and a sleepy fox was snoozing on the porch of a temporary building in the north car park. Inside England duly announced a wholly predictable squad, almost as if Steve Borthwick was doing his best to avoid stealing any of Thomas Tuchel\u2019s thunder. Borthwick also politely knocked back the invitation to pass on any tips to the incoming German \u2013 \u201che has plenty of experience in English sport already\u201d \u2013 beyond matter-of-factly quoting the well-known stat about international teams with homegrown coaches doing better in major tournaments. He preferred to leave it to others, too, to observe that across men\u2019s English cricket, football and rugby union he will soon be the solitary home -produced head honcho left. Even so, there was no avoiding the inevitable enquiries regarding his own assistant coaches which soon followed. Until now Borthwick had chosen to stay silent on the abrupt summer departure of two of his key managerial sidekicks, Felix Jones and Aled Walters. Here, finally, was a chance to tell the world it was very much their loss and that the pair would bitterly regret their decisions. Or, at least, that is what a straight-talking Teutonic leader might have done. Or, come to that, his immediate predecessor, Eddie Jones. Eddie\u2019s mood would have instantly darkened and a confrontational edge \u2013 \u201cWhat are you implying, mate?\u201d \u2013 would have swiftly surfaced. Borthwick, by contrast, resembled a man who has been kicked somewhere painful and still cannot entirely understand why. Which is the exact same question with which sizeable chunks of the English public are still wrestling. If (the stadium formerly known as) Twickenham is such a wonderful place to work, why did two of Borthwick\u2019s most highly rated lieutenants suddenly jump ship? Ignore for a moment that Jones is Irish and Walters is Welsh \u2013 pearl-clutching patriotism only appears to be fully ignited by arrivals from continental Europe \u2013 and the quick-fire defections do not seem a total coincidence. What is now a matter of record is that Borthwick did not see either coming. \u201cThe two of them are close, but it was still disappointing and surprising. I hadn\u2019t anticipated it.\u201d Really? If so there would usually be one of three conclusions. The first is that the England working environment is so stiflingly intense that unhappy employees felt unable to speak honestly and openly about their personal misgivings. The second is that they sense there is more chance of winning trophies elsewhere. And the third? That Borthwick\u2019s managerial antennae are not picking up certain \u201csoft\u201d signals that world-class coaches normally spot a mile away. Admittedly, there is one other possible explanation: that Borthwick has simply been unlucky. But Jones resigned without another job to go to and is being required to work remotely while serving his notice, which can be filed under \u201cnaughty boy nets\u201d or \u201csmall-minded pettiness\u201d depending on your viewpoint. Then again, given Jones is the chief architect of England\u2019s shiny new defensive system, the last thing the Rugby Football Union wants is to see him hunched over a laptop in a rival coaching box next month. Either way, Borthwick could have done with drawing a heavy line under it all this week. Unfortunately for him he has been unable to do so, the Premiership clubs having understandably blocked a proposed job-share deal which would have seen the respected Phil Morrow serve both England, who have a performance management role earmarked for him, and Saracens. It would instead appear that Morrow, who would need to be bought out of a very lucrative long-term contract at Sarries, will not be in a red rose tracksuit before next summer at the earliest. With Kevin Sinfield\u2019s role now more part-time and the new defence coach Joe El-Abd still working in France at Oyonnax, Borthwick\u2019s backroom team is at risk of resembling one of those frustratingly incomplete Ikea wardrobes which always seem to be missing one or two crucial screws. No wonder Borthwick was keen to project a steady-as-she-goes message. \u201cWe want to see the drama on the pitch ... when we see stuff happening off the pitch it\u2019s characterised sometimes as drama. But, for me, we have quite a stable coaching team [comprising] guys I\u2019ve worked with for a period of time now.\u201d The truth, though, is that it is not merely the players who could do with two or three resounding victories next month to prove all is fine and dandy. With Jamie George reconfirmed as captain the primary aim, accordingly, is to turn a string of narrow defeats this year into morale-lifting wins. \u201cIn each of those games we have been winning at some stage,\u201d stressed Borthwick. \u201cIf you include the Ireland game here there has been a key penalty and a key kick that has caused the result either to go for us or against us. As this team develops and matures, then I think we will understand [how to] close those games and finish the job.\u201d Which, of course, is precisely what earns top sporting alchemists their corn. Borthwick\u2019s team made encouraging on-field progress on their summer tour and the quality of the squad is perhaps best illustrated by some of the talent omitted from it. But as Herr Tuchel and Borthwick will doubtless agree when they do meet, clarity is everything when it comes to a team\u2019s long-term identity. And, regardless of the head coach\u2019s nationality, off-field uncertainty is rarely a recipe for sustained success on it.",

      "body": "<p>A potential merger between a German bank and an Italian rival would not normally elicit much interest beyond the business pages. But these are not normal times. The Italian bank UniCredit recently provoked a political backlash in Germany by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/23/unicredit-boosts-its-stake-in-commerzbank-applies-to-own-up-to-29point9percent-of-the-german-bank.html\">acquiring a 21% stake</a> in the German lender Commerzbank. Even chancellor Olaf Scholz weighed in, calling the Italian move \u201can unfriendly attack\u201d. The significance of this row runs far beyond the worlds of Italian and German finance. </p> <p>News of the acquisition came just weeks after the publication of a <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e481fd-2dc3-412d-be4c-f152a8232961_en?filename=The%20future%20of%20European%20competitiveness%20_%20A%20competitiveness%20strategy%20for%20Europe.pdf\">report</a> by Mario Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank, on how to address the EU\u2019s declining competitiveness against the US and China.<strong> </strong>The former Italian prime minister<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/draghi-urges-reform-massive-investment-revive-lagging-eu-economy-2024-09-09/\">warned</a> that the EU faces \u201cslow agony\u201d unless it takes radical action. One of Draghi\u2019s key recommendations was the need for deeper financial integration. In that context, German hostility to any tie-up raises serious questions about Berlin\u2019s political commitment to wider European reform.</p> <p>From a commercial perspective, a merger between the two banks makes obvious sense. UniCredit is Italy\u2019s second largest lender, with existing international operations, and it has done a remarkable job of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/italian-banking-crisis-unicredit-to-raise-13bn-euros\">restoring its profitability</a> after the Italian banking system\u2019s near-death experience in the wake of the global financial crisis, when it was overwhelmed by bad debts and concerns about the future of the single currency. Commerzbank, in contrast, despite being one of the biggest lenders to the Mittelstand (the small and medium-sized family-owned businesses that are the backbone of the German economy) is a perennial underperformer, and has long been seen as a takeover target. UniCredit already owns one of Germany\u2019s largest banks HypoVereinsbank,<strong> </strong>so a merger should yield significant cost savings.</p> <p>From a European perspective, a tie-up is clearly attractive too. Policymakers have long bemoaned that while Europe may have a single currency, it lacks a single financial system. More than 20 years after the launch of the euro, and despite post-crisis efforts to create a banking union, the banking system remains deeply fragmented along national lines, with very little cross-border lending. That puts Europe at a competitive disadvantage, denying the bloc any continent-wide economies of scale, while high costs and weak profitability have contributed to chronically weak lending growth. America\u2019s JP Morgan has a market capitalisation greater than that of the five largest EU banks combined.</p>    <p>So why the hostility in Germany to a UniCredit takeover of Commerzbank? Some of it reflects pique at the way the Italian lender has gone about amassing its stake.</p> <p>In September, UniCredit gatecrashed an attempt by the German government to <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240911-unicredit-takes-stake-in-commerzbank-fuelling-tie-up-talk\">offload on to the stock market</a> some of the shareholding it had acquired in a post-crisis bailout. UniCredit bought the 4.5% stake on offer from under Berlin\u2019s nose, to add to the 4.5% that it had already stealthily acquired. UniCredit says it believed the German authorities were aware of its plans and its acquisition was welcome. Since then, UniCredit has acquired a further 12% of the shares and is seeking European Central Bank approval to increase its stake to 29.9%. That would put it in a strong position to launch a full takeover at some point in the future.</p> <p>Nonetheless, much of the opposition smacks of pure protectionism. Unions have raised the spectre of big job losses if a takeover is allowed to proceed. Meanwhile, Bettina Orlopp, Commerzbank\u2019s chief financial officer, claimed in an interview that a takeover would lead to Commerzbank <a href=\"https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/banken/commerzbank-uebernahme-wir-wuerden-kunden-verlieren-warnt-bettina-orlopp-02/100073823.html\">losing customers</a>. She also raised the prospect of German savers being exposed to the risk of an Italian debt crisis, given UniCredit\u2019s large holdings of Italian bonds. German politicians from across the political spectrum have insisted that Commerzbank should remain independent and in German hands as a domestic competitor to Deutsche Bank, the country\u2019s other large nationwide lender. Berlin has said that it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/germany-wont-sell-more-commerzbank-shares-now-finance-agency-says-2024-09-20/\">no longer plans</a> to sell any more of its shareholding, making a full takeover impossible.</p> <p>Yet some of these arguments do not bear scrutiny. Greater eurozone banking integration will lead to greater efficiency and improved profitability, which in turn will enable banks to lend more, not less. Meanwhile, post-crisis reforms mean that banks are now required to maintain far higher levels of capital and are intensively supervised by the European Central Bank, significantly reducing the risk of failures. Besides, if Berlin were genuinely worried about the spillover risks to domestic savers from cross-border banks, it should back the creation of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/702b7f8c-888e-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896\">pan-European bank deposit guarantee scheme</a>. Instead, Berlin has consistently blocked this vital step to complete the banking union because it entails pooling financial risks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/22/eurozone-banks-starting-to-show-stress-as-loan-defaults-rise-ecb-warns\">Eurozone banks starting to show \u2018stress\u2019 as loan defaults rise, ECB warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is a price to be paid in Europe for <em>not</em> pooling risks \u2013 and it is rising all the time. As the economy stagnates, it becomes harder for governments to bring down debts and deficits, leading to rising populism and increased political fragmentation. That, in turn, makes it harder to tackle existential risks such as threats to European security and the climate crisis. Germany\u2019s leaders claim to support efforts to deepen European integration. But, too often, Berlin has been an obstacle to progress, bowing to domestic vested interests. The irony is that the biggest victim has been the German economy itself, which is now at the epicentre of Europe\u2019s stagnation crisis.</p> <p>No wonder the rest of Europe is watching Berlin\u2019s response to UniCredit\u2019s move on Commerzbank closely.

Meanwhile, Bettina Orlopp, Commerzbank\u2019s chief financial officer, claimed in an interview that a takeover would lead to Commerzbank losing customers. She also raised the prospect of German savers being exposed to the risk of an Italian debt crisis, given UniCredit\u2019s large holdings of Italian bonds. German politicians from across the political spectrum have insisted that Commerzbank should remain independent and in German hands as a domestic competitor to Deutsche Bank, the country\u2019s other large nationwide lender. Berlin has said that it no longer plans to sell any more of its shareholding, making a full takeover impossible. Yet some of these arguments do not bear scrutiny. Greater eurozone banking integration will lead to greater efficiency and improved profitability, which in turn will enable banks to lend more, not less. Meanwhile, post-crisis reforms mean that banks are now required to maintain far higher levels of capital and are intensively supervised by the European Central Bank, significantly reducing the risk of failures. Besides, if Berlin were genuinely worried about the spillover risks to domestic savers from cross-border banks, it should back the creation of a pan-European bank deposit guarantee scheme. Instead, Berlin has consistently blocked this vital step to complete the banking union because it entails pooling financial risks. But there is a price to be paid in Europe for not pooling risks \u2013 and it is rising all the time. As the economy stagnates, it becomes harder for governments to bring down debts and deficits, leading to rising populism and increased political fragmentation. That, in turn, makes it harder to tackle existential risks such as threats to European security and the climate crisis. Germany\u2019s leaders claim to support efforts to deepen European integration. But, too often, Berlin has been an obstacle to progress, bowing to domestic vested interests. The irony is that the biggest victim has been the German economy itself, which is now at the epicentre of Europe\u2019s stagnation crisis. No wonder the rest of Europe is watching Berlin\u2019s response to UniCredit\u2019s move on Commerzbank closely. Draghi\u2019s 400-page report contained hundreds of recommendations to improve Europe\u2019s competitiveness, many of which will force governments to confront difficult trade-offs. If Germany\u2019s leaders fall at this first hurdle, what chance Europe? Simon Nixon is a journalist and economics commentator",

The goals of the UK Plastics Pact \u2013 led by Wrap, whose work helps shape government policy on sustainability matters \u2013 included the target that 50% of uncut fruit and veg be sold loose by the end of the decade. The call for a ban suggests this target will not be met without government intervention, with Wrap calling for a formal consultation. A progress report published late last year said that in 2022 an average of 19.4% of fresh produce sales was loose, with the proportion by retailer varying from 2% to 30%. By comparison, in mainland Europe it is 50%. Plastic packaging had resulted in less store waste, simpler production lines and tidier shelves, Lamb said, but the flipside was about 30% of the fresh produce bought ending up in the bin because set pack sizes forced people to buy too much. A packaging ban on the 21 foods (when sold in amounts less than 1.5kg) could eliminate 100,000 tonnes of fruit and veg from the bin annually and 13,000 tonnes of single-use plastic film, Wrap said. It proposes a second phase that would extend the ban to all uncut produce with some exemptions, such as soft fruits and herbs. While two-thirds of shoppers claim they prefer to select and weigh produce, they do not always do so in practice. In stores where loose produce is already being sold, Lamb urged people to shop \u201clike our nan back in the day when everyone chose what they wanted in the grocery store\u201d. Companies needed to make it easy for shoppers to make price comparisons and weigh produce, she said, but the \u201cfinal step in the dance is the regulation with a timeline, creating a level playing field and a mandate to change\u201d. The call for a ban comes as separate research found 51% of food and drink items in UK supermarkets come in unnecessary plastic packaging, amounting to 29.8bn avoidable pieces annually. The study, commissioned by the packaging giant DS Smith, looked at more than 1,500 products, and found the worst offenders were processed foods including ready meals and meal kits. Avoidable plastic was found on 90% of ready meals and meal kits, 89% of bread, rice and cereal items, 83% of dairy products and 80% of meat and fish. In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cThis government is committed to cleaning up Britain and cracking down on plastic waste. We will roll out extended producer responsibility [a new packaging tax] to incentivise businesses to cut plastic packaging and the deposit return scheme to incentivise consumers to recycle.\u201d The plastic packaging ban hitlist Apples Aubergines Avocados Bananas Broccoli Cabbages Carrots Garlic Ginger Lemons Limes Mangos Onions Oranges Parsnips Pears Peppers Potatoes Salad tomatoes Squash Swede",

      "body": "<p>Good morning. I\u2019m really sorry about this, but today\u2019s newsletter is about the extent of the \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances and the government\u2019s fiscal rules.</p> <p>I don\u2019t like this any more than you do: I\u2019d frankly rather be writing about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/14/cheating-alleged-after-mens-world-conker-champion-found-with-steel-chestnut\">whether King Conker is a cheat</a>.

Several of today\u2019s front pages carry reports of planned tax rises to balance the books; meanwhile, Reeves is planning to redefine debt to give herself more room for manoeuvre. If you have found yourself confused by this, congratulations on at least paying close enough attention to notice how knotty it all is.</p> <p>There\u2019s lots to unpick. For today\u2019s newsletter, <em><strong>Ben Zaranko</strong></em><em>,<strong> </strong></em>a research economist with the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), helps explain what you need to know in the clearest possible terms. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Music</strong></em> | Liam Payne, a former member of the boyband One Direction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/16/liam-payne-former-one-direction-singer-dies-aged-31\">has died after falling from a third-floor hotel room</a> in Buenos Aires. Hundreds of fans gathered outside the hotel to pay tribute after the news, while authorities in Argentina said they were investigating the circumstances of Payne\u2019s death.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>National security</strong></em> | Counter-terrorism police are investigating whether Russian spies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-device-on-plane-that-caused-uk-warehouse-fire\">planted an incendiary device on a plane to Britain</a> that caught fire at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham in July, the Guardian can reveal. Investigators are examining possible links with a similar incident in Germany, also in July.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Extremism </strong></em>| An international network of \u201crace science\u201d activists seeking to influence public debate with discredited ideas on race and eugenics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/revealed-international-race-science-network-secretly-funded-by-us-tech-boss\">has been operating with secret funding from a multimillionaire US tech entrepreneur</a>. Seattle businessman Andrew Conru pulled his support after being approached by the Guardian.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Asylum</strong></em> | Nearly 63,000 people who were waiting for their cases to be processed at the time of the general election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/17/uk-asylum-backlog-rwanda-plan-hotels-deportations\">are expected to be granted asylum</a> after Labour dropped the Rwanda deportation scheme, an analysis has found. The Refugee Council said the asylum backlog was on track to be 59,000 cases lower at the start of 2025 after the processing of claims accelerated.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>US election </strong></em>| Kamala Harris said her presidency \u201cwould not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/kamala-harris-fox-news-interview\">in her first interview with Fox News</a> as she criticized Donald Trump over his threats against \u201cthe enemy within\u201d. In a contentious interview, Harris was pressed on subjects where she has come under attack from the right including immigration and the rights of transgender people.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018Painting a dire picture may well suit the Treasury\u2019</h2>    <p>It\u2019s less than two weeks until the budget \u2013 and the picture that Reeves has been painting is a pretty bleak one. By now, you are probably familiar with the claim that the Conservatives salted the earth so severely ahead of the election that the government will be forced to take emergency action. And you will have heard the arguments for and against that proposition \u2013 <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/articles/ps22bn-black-hole-was-obvious-anyone-who-dared-look\">summarised by Paul Johnson</a>, director of the IFS, as genuine dishonesty from the Tories but also \u201cobvious to all who cared to look\u201d.</p> <p>Until now, the government has been focusing on an estimated in-year shortfall of \u00a322bn in its messaging around the budget \u2013 but yesterday\u2019s front pages carried an alarming new number: an estimated \u00a340bn in tax rises and spending cuts needed to avoid a return to austerity.</p> <p>You could be forgiven for thinking that the situation has just got an awful lot worse \u2013 but these numbers refer to different things. If Reeves is now talking about the second figure, that may be because she feels the need to prime the public for an even more drastic set of measures \u2013 or to make the reality of the budget feel less draconian when it lands.</p> <p>\u201cSome of this is likely expectation management,\u201d Zaranko said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about internal negotiations, and painting a dire picture may well suit the Treasury when it\u2019s talking to government departments about their budgets.\u201d (See Eleni Courea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/16/rachel-reeves-tax-rises-spending-cuts-budget\">report from last night</a> for more on this.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, Reeves is looking at the fiscal rules that act as guardrails on the government\u2019s tax and spending decisions \u2013 and may be ready to make a significant change to give herself greater latitude to invest in public services. Here\u2019s how all of that fits together.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>\u00a322bn</strong> | The expected overspend this year</p> <p>This figure comes from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fixing-the-foundations-public-spending-audit-2024-25/fixing-the-foundations-public-spending-audit-2024-25-html\">a Treasury audit of public spending</a> commissioned by Labour after it came to power. That report came back with an estimate of \u00a321.9bn due to be spent in 2024-25 above the limits put in place by the Treasury.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. I\u2019m really sorry about this, but today\u2019s newsletter is about the extent of the \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances and the government\u2019s fiscal rules. I don\u2019t like this any more than you do: I\u2019d frankly rather be writing about whether King Conker is a cheat. But the budget is nearly upon us, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has started talking about a \u00a340bn funding gap, when you might have only just got used to being alarmed about the \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d. Several of today\u2019s front pages carry reports of planned tax rises to balance the books; meanwhile, Reeves is planning to redefine debt to give herself more room for manoeuvre. If you have found yourself confused by this, congratulations on at least paying close enough attention to notice how knotty it all is. There\u2019s lots to unpick. For today\u2019s newsletter, Ben Zaranko, a research economist with the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), helps explain what you need to know in the clearest possible terms. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Music | Liam Payne, a former member of the boyband One Direction, has died after falling from a third-floor hotel room in Buenos Aires. Hundreds of fans gathered outside the hotel to pay tribute after the news, while authorities in Argentina said they were investigating the circumstances of Payne\u2019s death. National security | Counter-terrorism police are investigating whether Russian spies planted an incendiary device on a plane to Britain that caught fire at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham in July, the Guardian can reveal. Investigators are examining possible links with a similar incident in Germany, also in July. Extremism | An international network of \u201crace science\u201d activists seeking to influence public debate with discredited ideas on race and eugenics has been operating with secret funding from a multimillionaire US tech entrepreneur. Seattle businessman Andrew Conru pulled his support after being approached by the Guardian. Asylum | Nearly 63,000 people who were waiting for their cases to be processed at the time of the general election are expected to be granted asylum after Labour dropped the Rwanda deportation scheme, an analysis has found. The Refugee Council said the asylum backlog was on track to be 59,000 cases lower at the start of 2025 after the processing of claims accelerated. US election | Kamala Harris said her presidency \u201cwould not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency\u201d in her first interview with Fox News as she criticized Donald Trump over his threats against \u201cthe enemy within\u201d. In a contentious interview, Harris was pressed on subjects where she has come under attack from the right including immigration and the rights of transgender people. In depth: \u2018Painting a dire picture may well suit the Treasury\u2019 It\u2019s less than two weeks until the budget \u2013 and the picture that Reeves has been painting is a pretty bleak one. By now, you are probably familiar with the claim that the Conservatives salted the earth so severely ahead of the election that the government will be forced to take emergency action. And you will have heard the arguments for and against that proposition \u2013 summarised by Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, as genuine dishonesty from the Tories but also \u201cobvious to all who cared to look\u201d. Until now, the government has been focusing on an estimated in-year shortfall of \u00a322bn in its messaging around the budget \u2013 but yesterday\u2019s front pages carried an alarming new number: an estimated \u00a340bn in tax rises and spending cuts needed to avoid a return to austerity. You could be forgiven for thinking that the situation has just got an awful lot worse \u2013 but these numbers refer to different things. If Reeves is now talking about the second figure, that may be because she feels the need to prime the public for an even more drastic set of measures \u2013 or to make the reality of the budget feel less draconian when it lands. \u201cSome of this is likely expectation management,\u201d Zaranko said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about internal negotiations, and painting a dire picture may well suit the Treasury when it\u2019s talking to government departments about their budgets.\u201d (See Eleni Courea\u2019s report from last night for more on this.) Meanwhile, Reeves is looking at the fiscal rules that act as guardrails on the government\u2019s tax and spending decisions \u2013 and may be ready to make a significant change to give herself greater latitude to invest in public services. Here\u2019s how all of that fits together. *** \u00a322bn | The expected overspend this year This figure comes from a Treasury audit of public spending commissioned by Labour after it came to power. That report came back with an estimate of \u00a321.9bn due to be spent in 2024-25 above the limits put in place by the Treasury. Although it\u2019s pretty small as a proportion of overall public spending \u2013 expected to be about \u00a31.226tn \u2013 it is a larger overspend than has been typical in recent years. Labour has been keen to paint this number as a \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances, and you can see why: black holes are scary, massive and threaten to suck everything into them. The ones in space aren\u2019t usually blamed on the Tories, but this one easily can be. But because \u201cblack hole\u201d is also used in other contexts, it isn\u2019t very helpful for anyone trying to understand what\u2019s actually going on. \u201cIt makes it sound scarier than it is,\u201d Zaranko said. \u201cCalling it an overspend is more accurate and intelligible.\u201d The really important thing to keep in mind about this figure is that it applies to the current financial year alone. \u201cThe big question is how much of it turns into a permanent problem for the government,\u201d Zaranko said. \u201cMoney being spent on a one-off basis to send arms to Ukraine is very different to increases in public sector pay across the board, which will persist over time. \u201cWe think, very conservatively, that about half of the \u00a322bn will prove permanent. Obviously, this feeds into the future picture \u2013 but the truth is that even if Reeves had taken a look at the books and declared the Treasury a black hole-free zone this year, she would have still had a similar challenge going into the budget.\u201d Which brings us to \u2026 *** \u00a340bn | The ongoing annual funding gap for day-to-day spending This number entered the political discourse yesterday. The FT, which first reported the story, described it as \u201cthe funding that Reeves needs to protect key government departments from real-terms spending cuts, cover the enduring impact of an annual \u00a322bn overspend and build up a fiscal buffer for the remainder of the parliament\u201d. Whereas the \u00a322bn figure just refers to the picture in 2024-2025, \u201cthis refers to the challenge over the next few years\u201d, Zaranko said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how Reeves calculates it, but it is probably best understood as the amount that the government needs to find each year if it is going to meet its day-to-day spending commitments without borrowing.\u201d Labour pledged that there would be no return to austerity, and although there may be spending cuts in some government departments, that means this figure mostly refers to how much will be needed in additional tax each year, which will be detailed by Reeves in the budget. It\u2019s worth remembering that the government sets its own fiscal rules, and it could make different choices about how much it is allowed to borrow to meet its spending commitments. \u201cThere is some agency here,\u201d Zaranko said. \u201cThis figure is really a measure of whether you\u2019re hitting your self-imposed targets and, if you\u2019re breaching them, by how much.\u201d That means that another important factor in understanding these figures is how those rules were chosen. Which brings us to \u2026 *** The fiscal rules | Borrowing to invest in major projects, but not to cover day-to-day spending Nimo spoke to Richard Partington last week about the government\u2019s approach to the fiscal rules, and last December Aditya Chakrabortty set out some of the objections to how they are devised. Here\u2019s Aditya on the Conservatives\u2019 rule, adopted by Labour, that debt should be on course to fall as a share of national income at the end of a five-year rolling period: That just means debt should be falling by the last year of that period. That\u2019s it. Think about what that means: it\u2019s like saying on 1 January, right, I\u2019m going to go on a diet this year, but I\u2019m going to lose all the weight in December. Nobody would take you seriously if you said that, and economists from a broad spectrum think it\u2019s stupid. Fiscal rules are there to look plausible, they are often broken when it comes to the crunch, and they rely on the public not really knowing what they mean.\u201d Reeves is not expected to change the rules set out in the Labour manifesto: that day-to-day costs must be paid for with government revenue, and the debt rule outlined above. But she may try to \u201cbe a bit clever with them\u201d, as Richard put it, by changing how the national debt is calculated, thereby allowing billions of borrowed money to be used for capital expenditure. \u201cSo that wouldn\u2019t make it any easier to cover public sector pay rises, for example,\u201d Zaranko said. \u201cBut it would make a material difference to things like transport infrastructure.\u201d Neither the \u00a322bn overspend nor the \u00a340bn funding gap take those one-off costs into account. But depending on how the definition of debt is changed, between \u00a310bn and \u00a350bn could be made available. In the end, Zaranko said, \u201cfiscal rules can only get you so far. They are meant to be a signal of your strategy, not something that sets it.\u201d On borrowing to invest, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s really about ensuring that the money is going to worthwhile projects, and how you calculate that. The risk is that the government sets the rules in ways that suit it in the short term without any great strategic reason behind it. But if you then change them again, you further undermine faith in the whole thing \u2013 which is already threadbare.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading After the awful news of the death of Liam Payne (above), Alexis Petridis writes that despite low expectations when One Direction were formed on the X Factor, \u201cPayne and co succeeded in reinventing the boyband\u201d.

Archie As MPs begin to scrutinise a bill that would legalise assisted dying, a panel of opinion writers make arguments for and against \u2013 from Charlie Corke\u2019s call for a \u201cswift, efficient and compassionate\u201d safeguarding system to Lucy Webster\u2019s warning that the pandemic revealed that \u201cneither the state nor society at large can be trusted with any additional powers to take disabled people\u2019s lives\u201d.

Cartoon of the day | Nicola Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad In Ireland, 80% of students opt to take part in a transition year (TY), an off-curriculum gap year of sorts halfway through secondary school. There is a loose structure: core subjects like Irish, English and maths still have to be covered, and work experience is encouraged. But it\u2019s up to schools to decide what else to offer. Students aren\u2019t graded and can take up anything from classical music and drama to bike maintenance. It can have lifelong impacts: Paul Mescal and Cillian Murphy cultivated their love for acting in TY. Though there are drawbacks (costs can be prohibitive for some parents), for those who can take part TY can be transformative. Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work? And finally, the Guardian\u2019s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day. Until tomorrow.

Researchers from CE Delft modelled the climate effects of a staggered tax on flights and found the proposal would reduce passenger numbers in 2028 by 26% and emissions by 21% from a business-as-usual scenario. The levy would start at zero for the first return flight in 12 months and rise by \u20ac100 for each return trip, with surcharges for longer distances and first class travel.

      "body": "<p>Political speeches seem to fall like autumn leaves at this time of year. Speeches at party conferences. Speeches at leadership hustings and to the UN general assembly. And the budget speech itself is still to come. Yet even the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, may struggle to say anything more illuminating than a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/attorney-generals-2024-bingham-lecture-on-the-rule-of-law\">speech this week</a> by a far less high-profile government member than she.</p> <p>In July, Richard Hermer KC was plucked from a successful bar career by his fellow barrister Keir Starmer, given a peerage and made attorney general. It was a hand-picked appointment by Starmer, who snubbed the shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, to make it. As Lord Hermer, the former head of Matrix Chambers is now the Starmer government\u2019s lawyer. He is also, we may reasonably assume, Starmer\u2019s eminent legal proxy in the attorney\u2019s role.</p> <p>This week, Hermer gave the annual Bingham lecture at Gray\u2019s Inn. His subject, doubtless chosen in honour of the great judge whom the event commemorated, was the rule of law and the threat posed to it by populism. Hermer unquestionably wrote his own script on Monday. But it is surely not reckless to believe that he was also saying things with which Starmer would be fully in accord and to which he himself attaches special importance.</p> <p>Hermer\u2019s lecture was an uncompromising reaffirmation of the centrality of law to government and politics, domestically and internationally. It condemned the previous government for knowingly breaching the law in some of its Brexit legislation, and for removing the role of the courts over Rwanda. By contrast, Hermer said that Labour would abide by and uphold the European convention on human rights. He then went on to discuss subjects ranging from legislative statutory instruments to the UN.</p> <p>His central message, though, was that this will be a government that practises what it preaches. It would uphold the rule of law \u201cat every turn\u201d, said Hermer. Respect for law lay behind its immediate action in July <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9dn8erg3zo\">to scrap</a> the Rwanda deportation plan. It was again the basis of the more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/britain-to-return-chagos-islands-to-mauritius-ending-years-of-dispute\">recent agreement</a> reached with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. The review of arms licensing to Israel, he added, came from the same approach. It was a decision based on \u201claw, not politics\u201d. International law, Hermer said, was seamlessly part of the rule of law, too. It was \u201cnot simply some kind of optional add-on, with which states can pick or choose whether to comply\u201d.</p> <p>There are three ways in which this lecture matters very much. The first is simply that Hermer is right. The rule of law applies to all of those who live in its jurisdiction. None of those who sometimes claim to be above the law \u2013 including the super-rich, the press and the military \u2013 are exempt. Nor are nation states. It is true that the rule of law is a phrase that has sometimes been misused, especially by politicians. But, as Hermer pointed out, it is emphatically not the same as rule <em>by</em> law, which says little more than laws must be obeyed, however they have been made.</p> <p>The rule <em>of</em> law, though, is much more substantial and more subtle than this, but it is also more unifying and underpinning. Tom Bingham\u2019s definition, developed at length in his 2010 book The Rule of Law, is: \u201cThat all persons and authorities within the state, whether public or private, should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made, taking effect (generally) in the future and publicly administered in the courts.\u201d No one gets an entirely free pass from the rule of law, especially not governments.</p> <p>The second takeaway is that Hermer\u2019s lecture may mark a new chapter of British governmental deference to this interpretation. In effect, Britain has undergone a quiet constitutional revolution in the past quarter of a century. It has been marked by the passing of the Human Rights Act 1998, the separation of the judiciary from the legislature in 2005 and, not least, by Bingham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/sep/11/lord-bingham-of-cornhill-obituary\">thinking and continuing influence</a>. But it is not yet an entirely settled matter.</p> <p>The quiet revolution made some significant arguments between the courts and the executive more likely. After 2010, under Conservative governments, things duly got rocky, especially on immigration. Brexit brought this to a head, culminating in the supreme court\u2019s <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/decision-of-the-supreme-court-on-the-prorogation-of-parliament/\">prorogation ruling</a> in 2019 and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/15/supreme-court-rejects-rishi-sunak-plan-to-deport-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda\">Rwanda ruling</a> in 2023. In sections of the Tory party and press, the legacy is populist opposition to the European convention, hostility to international law more generally and criticism of judges as part of a liberal elite.</p> <p>Starmer and Hermer mark at least a temporary end to all this. Whether that endures will depend on whether Labour and the judges can promote respect for the courts. But it will also depend on Conservative party politics. For now, though, the attorney\u2019s role will not be to fight the judges, as it was when Suella Braverman was the worst attorney general of modern times, but to support them.</p> <p>The final conclusion is in some respects the most tantalising. But it is also the most important of all. The lecture obviously says a lot about Hermer\u2019s approach to his job. But it also implies a great deal about Starmer\u2019s own approach to his own role. Critics sometimes question what Starmer actually believes in. Some claim that he believes in very little. Like it or not, though, this lecture suggests that is wrong.</p> <p>Starmer believes in the rule of law. It is his red line. He absolutely does not wish to cross it if he can avoid doing so. Moreover, the evidence so far is that he will not. It is why, we can speculate, he chose Hermer to be his attorney general in the first place \u2013 because they would think alike.

      "bodyText": "Mysterious tar balls washing up in Sydney have forced the closure of seven beaches, including Bondi, but authorities are yet to identify where they are coming from. Clovelly beach and the northern end of Maroubra were closed on Thursday when more tar balls were found after Gordons Bay and Coogee beaches were earlier closed by Randwick council. People have been warned not to touch or go near the debris. Bondi, Tamarama and Bronte beaches were also closed \u201cout of precaution\u201d, neighbouring Waverley council said in a statement on Thursday afternoon. Randwick council said on Wednesday evening that preliminary test results had identified the dark spheres as \u201ctar balls\u201d \u2013 which are formed when oil comes into contact with debris and water, usually as a result of oil spills or seepage. The council testing showed the debris was a hydrocarbon-based pollutant \u2013 the chief component of petroleum-based products. Council employees on jetskis spotted a suspected oil slick out at sea on Wednesday morning, the Randwick council mayor, Dylan Parker, said at the time. However, the Port Authority of NSW said no oil spills had been reported by vessels. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know what has happened to produce the debris washing up on our beaches,\u201d Parker said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe will continue to work with relevant authorities to ensure the safety of the public and clean up our beaches.\u201d The four Randwick beaches were closed until further notice. Waverley council said it had closed its beaches after the environment watchdog formally notified it that \u201cpea to marble-size balls of light grey-white colour were observed by EPA staff on Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches\u201d. \u201cAs a precaution, all Waverley beaches will be closed until further investigation has been carried out by the EPA and relevant government bodies,\u201d the council said. The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said eastern suburbs beaches had been closed \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d. He said the public would be kept updated on the investigations being led by the Environment Protection Authority. \u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019re fully investigating,\u201d Minns said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual occurrence on Sydney\u2019s beaches. The EPA is leading those investigations. The council is responsible for closing down the beaches.\u201d The EPA said in a statement that balls had also been observed at Congwong, Frenchmans, Little Bay and Malabar beaches. \u201cAt this stage, the origin and contents of the balls remains a mystery,\u201d the watchdog said on Thursday. \u201cBut the EPA is conducting extensive testing on a number of samples. While we understand initial Randwick city council testing suggests the presence of hydrocarbon, at this stage EPA tests cannot confirm the contents.\u201d Stephen Beaman, EPA\u2019s executive director of regulatory practice and services, told reporters on Thursday that their test results were matching up with those of Randwick council. He said the material was \u201cfibrous\u201d and \u201cunusual\u201d. \u201cWe are actually seeing, as we move away from the Coogee area, the size of the balls are getting smaller,\u201d Beaman said. \u201cProbably getting a lot of wave action in the surf zone, breaking that material up.\u201d The EPA said until the clean-up was concluded \u201cwe advise against swimming and touching any balls that may have washed ashore in the identified areas\u201d. NSW Maritime took over coordination of the incident on Thursday. Its director, Darren Wood, said the organisation would be working with Randwick council, the EPA, the port authority and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa). \u201cWe\u2019ve had vessels out on our water. We can ensure that we can\u2019t see any more sheen on that water,\u201d Wood told reporters in Coogee on Thursday. \u201cWe also can\u2019t see any more balls that are drifting in towards the beaches of the city, which is a good sign at the moment.\u201d NSW Maritime was working with Amsa to find the source of the debris. \u201cThey will do reverse modelling and drift modelling, taking into account the currents and wind, for us to be able to work out whether it comes from south, north or east of NSW, to try and give better information on the likely source,\u201d Wood said. Parker said Randwick council staff had been working with the EPA, port authority and Transport for NSW on the clean-up response. \u201cOur community is rightfully very protective of our natural environment and this has been a very concerning incident,\u201d the mayor said on Wednesday. \u201cWe have engaged an expert occupational hygienist and a specialist waste removal contractor who are currently systematically removing the debris from the beaches in accordance with an agreed safe work method statement developed with the NSW EPA.\u201d Louise Morris, the oil and gas campaign manager at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, has said tar balls are usually formed after an oil spill when petroleum is washed in waves and currents, making it condense and coagulate. \u201cThe more it keeps gripping on to other substances, it solidifies and condenses,\u201d Morris said. \u201cPart of that process of washing through the ocean means that they form a spherical shape.\u201d Any oil spill can be harmful to marine life but Dr Sharon Hook, CSIRO\u2019s principal research scientist, said Sydney\u2019s beaches would be safe for people once the tar balls were collected and removed. They \u201care filled with carcinogenic compounds so you wouldn\u2019t want people to come in contact with them,\u201d she told ABC radio. \u201c[But] as soon as it [the beach] is cleaned it will be safe because the chemicals and tar stick together.

      "bodyText": "As the ferry returns us to Corran, my gaze lingers over Loch Linnhe\u2019s glassy surface. \u201cThese peninsulas take the water between thumb and finger / like women feeling for the smoothness of yard-goods,\u201d wrote Elizabeth Bishop in her poem The Map. While she didn\u2019t mean precisely here, between the water\u2019s sheen and my revised grasp of local geography, I can see exactly what she meant. This is our second attempt to get to Ardnamurchan lighthouse, which stands on the most westerly point of mainland Britain. Our first had been from the head of Loch Eil, where its marine waters are finally exhausted by the mountains\u2019 rise. We\u2019d turned off the main road. Nine miles of single-track brought us to the inflection point that reveals Loch Eil to be a finger\u2019s crook of the 30-mile stretch of Loch Linnhe. Across the narrows was Fort William\u2019s different world. We\u2019d pressed on through bleak hills and patchy forest until, running out of daylight, we\u2019d given up and taken the Corran ferry back to the other side. But the siren name of Ardnamurchan kept calling. So here we are, magicked by the ferry on to a double-lane carriageway, travelling west. The outgoing tide of Loch Sunart is announced with meadow-deep piles of gold. This is egg wrack, Ascophyllum nodosum, a seaweed that thrives in Scottish lochs as the sea\u2019s long reach dissipates the waves\u2019 agitation. Beyond Strontian village, the road slowly reverts to single-track. And now the journey is punctuated with passing places and cattle grids and narrow bridges over streams that gradually lose their English names, leaving only the Scottish Gaelic. I recognise abhainn (river) from my school Irish. But allt (burn) has me reaching for the Irish word ailt (ravine). I\u2019m still pondering their possible connection as the road carries us through coastal oakwood up into the peninsula\u2019s rucked interior, where burns spill down heathery ridges and out of the mouths of the hanging glens. Finally, the Ardnamurchan lighthouse. We climb the tower into its dazzling lantern room that lifts our gaze over a vast and silken sea, until land interrupts water\u2019s hegemony with the knuckles of the Hebrides. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter/X at @gdncountrydiary \u2022 Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian\u2019s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount",

This is despite calls for a rethink from some Labor MPs who were dismayed at the timing of Albanese\u2019s decision to buy the house, ahead of an election in which the cost and availability of housing is likely to be a central issue. \u201cHow do you convince [voters] we\u2019re not on the side of people with lots of homes when the boss is buying a very expensive one?\u201d one MP asked, in comments to Guardian Australia on Wednesday. \u201cCapital gains is where I would start.\u201d The Greens have also renewed their calls for the government to remove the concessions they argue are too generous and are contributing to the unavailability of affordable housing for many would-be homebuyers. But the government is not budging in its refusal to return to the policy positions on the tax treatment of housing investments that it took to the 2019 election and which it considered rejected by the electorate. Asked a second time on Thursday if he was ruling out changes to negative gearing in particular, Marles replied: \u201cI just did.\u201d \u201cAnd not only have I done that, the prime minister has made that clear,\u201d Marles said. \u201cObviously none of this changes that.\u201d He defended Albanese\u2019s decision to buy the property and said he and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, were entitled to have \u201ctheir own private life\u201d. \u201cObviously the purchase of a property sits in that domain,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what Australians want to know is that when the prime minister goes to work each day, he\u2019s focused on their challenges and their issues.

      "body": "<p>Rachel Reeves is looking for taxes to raise, rather than ones to abolish. Never mind: here is a tax that ought to be scrapped by a government that calls itself pro-growth, pro-business and pro-investment, which was the pitch at this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/14/who-will-attend-uk-investment-summit-agenda\">big summit</a>. What\u2019s more, the enticing claim from abolitionists is that getting rid of the tax could \u2013 with a few qualifications \u2013 pay for itself over time because other Treasury receipts would rise.</p> <p>The tax is stamp duty on shares \u2013 or, in full, stamp duty reserve tax, or SDRT. It is the 0.5% levy on purchases of shares in UK companies that brought \u00a33.8bn into the Treasury in the 2022-23 tax year. Ireland has a higher rate, 1%, but nobody else does. The US, China and Germany don\u2019t impose any equivalent tax at all. So the claim that the UK is at a competitive disadvantage in attracting listings and liquidity to its stock market looks solid. At a moment of panic over the sleepy state of London, especially at the bottom half of the stock market, that point ought to resonate.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/25/im-embarrassed-about-how-horribly-overpaid-i-was-tax-campaigner-dan-neidle\">Dan Neidle</a>, of Tax Policy Associates, <a href=\"https://taxpolicy.org.uk/2024/10/15/how-to-reform-stamp-duty-on-shares-abolish-it/\">making the case</a> for abolition this week, pointed to other effects and distortions. While the tax is ultimately borne by end-investors \u2013 private individuals, pension funds, unit trusts and so on \u2013 there is also a cost to companies when they raise equity. Because the requirement for buyers to pay stamp duty is a depressing force on share prices, the cost of equity for companies is marginally higher than it would otherwise be.</p> <p>Similarly, there is an incentive for companies to use debt, which doesn\u2019t carry stamp duty, as opposed to equity. \u201cThis all creates a bias in favour of overseas companies versus UK companies, private companies versus public, and debt versus equity. None of these are desirable,\u201d argues Neidle. Absolutely right.</p> <p>The claim that abolishing stamp duty could pay for itself is looser. It is based on a <a href=\"https://cps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Oxera-Stamp-Duty-analysis-February-2024.pdf\">calculation</a> by the independent consultancy Oxera for the free-market Centre for Policy Studies thinktank that there would be a permanent increase in GDP of between 0.2% and 0.7%, yielding a higher tax take of \u00a32.1bn to \u00a36.8bn. At the midpoint of that range, the lost \u00a33.8bn to the Treasury would be offset.</p> <p>Would a boost for the wider economy really happen? The argument is that by lowering the cost of equity, and thus companies\u2019 overall funding costs, business investment should rise eventually. Marginal projects would become more attractive, and there ought to be a compounding effect. In terms of direction, the argument feels sound \u2013 but, as the range in the projections suggests, precision is tricky.</p> <p>Thus Neidle\u2019s suggestion sounds best: abolish the tax by phasing it out \u2013 a 0.1 percentage point cut per year for five years. To calm Treasury nerves, there could be a review after two. That would have the useful side-effect, as he says, of avoiding an instant windfall gain (from higher share prices) for current owners.</p> <p>An alternative approach is being promoted by the fund manager Abrdn and others: scrap stamp duty on all shares outside the FTSE 100 index. Shares on the Aim market are already exempt, but an extension up to and including FTSE 250 stocks would directly benefit the area of the market where the crisis of liquidity is most acute. That idea also has merit: the FTSE 250 could test the waters for full abolition.</p> <p>Whatever the model, something deserves to happen. Indeed, it is bizarre, at a moment when we\u2019re awash with reports on how to reform the UK\u2019s capital markets, that abolishing stamp duty hasn\u2019t been at the centre of the debate. You have to dig as far as page 18 of the <a href=\"https://capitalmarketsindustrytaskforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Capital-Markets-Of-Tomorrow-report.pdf\">last report</a> from the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce to read the excellent argument that it is nonsensical for the Treasury to tax UK retail investors when they buy shares in the UK-listed sports car maker Aston Martin but not when they invest in the German-listed Porsche or US-listed Tesla.</p> <p>Perhaps the hesitation flows from the thought that it\u2019s hard to imagine the Treasury, especially under a Labour administration, surrendering \u00a33.8bn upfront via a policy that smells like a giveaway to the share-buying classes and big City firms.</p> <p>On that score, there are two responses. First, the City, in the sense of fat investment banks, would not directly benefit because market-makers don\u2019t pay anyway.

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves is looking for taxes to raise, rather than ones to abolish. Never mind: here is a tax that ought to be scrapped by a government that calls itself pro-growth, pro-business and pro-investment, which was the pitch at this week\u2019s big summit. What\u2019s more, the enticing claim from abolitionists is that getting rid of the tax could \u2013 with a few qualifications \u2013 pay for itself over time because other Treasury receipts would rise. The tax is stamp duty on shares \u2013 or, in full, stamp duty reserve tax, or SDRT. It is the 0.5% levy on purchases of shares in UK companies that brought \u00a33.8bn into the Treasury in the 2022-23 tax year. Ireland has a higher rate, 1%, but nobody else does. The US, China and Germany don\u2019t impose any equivalent tax at all. So the claim that the UK is at a competitive disadvantage in attracting listings and liquidity to its stock market looks solid. At a moment of panic over the sleepy state of London, especially at the bottom half of the stock market, that point ought to resonate. Dan Neidle, of Tax Policy Associates, making the case for abolition this week, pointed to other effects and distortions. While the tax is ultimately borne by end-investors \u2013 private individuals, pension funds, unit trusts and so on \u2013 there is also a cost to companies when they raise equity. Because the requirement for buyers to pay stamp duty is a depressing force on share prices, the cost of equity for companies is marginally higher than it would otherwise be. Similarly, there is an incentive for companies to use debt, which doesn\u2019t carry stamp duty, as opposed to equity. \u201cThis all creates a bias in favour of overseas companies versus UK companies, private companies versus public, and debt versus equity. None of these are desirable,\u201d argues Neidle. Absolutely right. The claim that abolishing stamp duty could pay for itself is looser. It is based on a calculation by the independent consultancy Oxera for the free-market Centre for Policy Studies thinktank that there would be a permanent increase in GDP of between 0.2% and 0.7%, yielding a higher tax take of \u00a32.1bn to \u00a36.8bn. At the midpoint of that range, the lost \u00a33.8bn to the Treasury would be offset. Would a boost for the wider economy really happen? The argument is that by lowering the cost of equity, and thus companies\u2019 overall funding costs, business investment should rise eventually. Marginal projects would become more attractive, and there ought to be a compounding effect. In terms of direction, the argument feels sound \u2013 but, as the range in the projections suggests, precision is tricky. Thus Neidle\u2019s suggestion sounds best: abolish the tax by phasing it out \u2013 a 0.1 percentage point cut per year for five years. To calm Treasury nerves, there could be a review after two. That would have the useful side-effect, as he says, of avoiding an instant windfall gain (from higher share prices) for current owners. An alternative approach is being promoted by the fund manager Abrdn and others: scrap stamp duty on all shares outside the FTSE 100 index. Shares on the Aim market are already exempt, but an extension up to and including FTSE 250 stocks would directly benefit the area of the market where the crisis of liquidity is most acute. That idea also has merit: the FTSE 250 could test the waters for full abolition. Whatever the model, something deserves to happen. Indeed, it is bizarre, at a moment when we\u2019re awash with reports on how to reform the UK\u2019s capital markets, that abolishing stamp duty hasn\u2019t been at the centre of the debate. You have to dig as far as page 18 of the last report from the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce to read the excellent argument that it is nonsensical for the Treasury to tax UK retail investors when they buy shares in the UK-listed sports car maker Aston Martin but not when they invest in the German-listed Porsche or US-listed Tesla. Perhaps the hesitation flows from the thought that it\u2019s hard to imagine the Treasury, especially under a Labour administration, surrendering \u00a33.8bn upfront via a policy that smells like a giveaway to the share-buying classes and big City firms. On that score, there are two responses. First, the City, in the sense of fat investment banks, would not directly benefit because market-makers don\u2019t pay anyway. SDRT is primarily a tax on ordinary pension savers, other end-investors and companies raising capital. Second, another of Neidle\u2019s arguments, it might be easier for a Labour chancellor rather than a Tory one to navigate the messy politics around an otherwise logical reform. If Reeves is looking for a rabbit to produce from her hat on budget day, abolishing SDRT fits the bill, especially if she\u2019s simultaneously raising capital gains tax. As a serious signal of being open for investment, it would beat a feelgood summit.",

And that\u2019s where the problem of weak governments really counts against her.\u201d</p> <p>Outlining her agenda to the European parliament last July, von der Leyen promised a \u201cclean industrial deal\u201d aimed at boosting green jobs and industries within her first 100 days, higher and better coordinated European defence spending, and renewed efforts to bring Ukraine and western Balkan countries into the EU.</p> <p>Without action on the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/eu-mario-draghi-report-spending-boost\">the EU risks \u201ca slow and agonising decline\u201d</a>, according to Mario Draghi, the former Italian prime minister, who published a 400-page <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/topics/strengthening-european-competitiveness/eu-competitiveness-looking-ahead_en\">report</a> outlining the \u201cexistential challenge\u201d posed by Europe\u2019s economic weakness vis-a-vis big competitors, such as the US and China. The remedy could cost up to \u20ac800bn (\u00a3670bn) a year, a level of investment equivalent to 5% of the EU\u2019s economic output, he concluded. That is a conservative estimate, the report says, as it does not count spending on improving skills or adapting to climate breakdown.</p>    <p>So far, von der Leyen has stopped short of endorsing common borrowing to pay for this agenda. The decision rests with the 27 national leaders. But Germany, the EU\u2019s biggest economy, has poured cold water over a second round of common debt, modelled on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/franco-german-plan-for-european-recovery-will-face-compromises\">the groundbreaking Covid recovery plan</a>.</p> <p>Luuk van Middelaar, a former senior EU official and co-founder of the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics, said he was worried about the risk of disconnect between the Draghi agenda and what national governments can agree to. \u201cEuropean national leaders \u2026 can only spend limited political capital on European initiatives. The stars for that have to be aligned for things to work out and currently they are not aligned at all.\u201d</p> <p>There is \u201ca sense of urgency in Brussels about the state of the world and how Europe is losing out and we need to do something\u201d combined with \u201cweak national governments\u201d faced with an agenda that is important rather than urgent, Van Middelaar said. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s not urgent, it is very difficult to mobilise the political will of 27 or at least a good majority of national governments to act.\u201d</p> <p>Adding to the fragmentation, far-right parties have made advances across the continent and are in government, or coalitions or supporting governments in seven EU member states: Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden. The far right is now the largest party in Austria, although unlikely to form a government. Europe\u2019s far-right parties remain divided, except when it comes to opposing further European integration.</p>    <p>In the next five-year term, the EU may also face tougher choices, which could further strain shaky coalitions and governments with a far-right presence. \u201cThe first von der Leyen term was about the twin green and digital transition, two priorities with strong synergies. Now the second term will be dominated by trade offs,\u201d said Georg Riekeles, a former commission official, now at the European Policy Centre. For instance, he sees a trade-off between the EU\u2019s green deal \u2013 a dash for offshore wind energy \u2013 and economic security. \u201cFor good reasons, we probably don\u2019t want to let China into the supply chain for critical infrastructure or provide our offshore wind turbines \u2026 Yet without Chinese climate tech, our green deal is going to be a lot more expensive.\u201d</p> <p>Grabbe does not see a long-term risk to the green transition but she said: \u201cOur clean tech needs a much better strategy because the Chinese bet on clean tech and they were right to do so. And our car industry being so slow to respond to the policy signals has resulted in the current situation where they\u2019re in serious trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Throw into the mix the task of agreeing a new EU budget by the end of the five-year period and the picture looks even trickier. This is always a fiendishly difficult political high-wire act, but the next one will generate even harder political fights.</p> <p>EU officials in charge of the budget will have to square many circles, the most difficult of all being the issue of net payers that do not want a bigger EU budget at a time of increased spending pressures.</p> <p>Also, EU debt rose to \u20ac459bn in 2023, doubling since 2021, largely due to the Covid recovery fund. So far, EU governments have been unable to agree on how to generate funds to pay back the debt, despite the looming repayment timeline starting at the end of 2027.</p> <p>It could be a messy, politically tempestuous period for the EU. But the force of external pressures will not go away, meaning there is a good chance that many items on the von der Leyen agenda will become national government priorities after five years, Grabbe said.</p> <p>The \u201cforce of external events and pressures\u201d will create its own momentum, whether through climate impacts such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/16/climate-scientists-troubled-by-damage-from-floods-ravaging-central-europe\">floods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/18/floods-in-poland-and-wildfires-in-portugal-show-reality-of-climate-breakdown-says-eu\">fires</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/25/global-heating-doubled-chance-of-extreme-rain-in-europe-in-september\">storms</a>, public expectations for high-quality jobs, or the threat of a revanchist Russia, she said, adding: \u201cWe will feel a strong pressure for Europe.\u201d</p>",

France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz have been humbled by punishing electoral defeats. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, presides over a minority government in a country riven by division after a controversial amnesty bill. In Poland, Donald Tusk enjoys a much stronger position, but grapples with an unwieldy coalition and an opposition-allied president.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s eerie being in a room with the Reeve siblings. All three are dead ringers for their father, Christopher. Matthew, 44, resembles Reeve as Clark Kent. Alexandra, 40, shares his angular beauty. The youngest, Will, 32, looks like him as Superman. They are almost as tall as their 6ft 4in father: Will is 6ft 3in, Alexandra 6ft and Matthew 6ft 2in. As for their jobs, Matthew makes films, Alexandra is a legislation lawyer based in Washington DC and Will is a TV sports journalist. Their father was a sport-obsessed actor-turned-director who campaigned to change the law on a number of fronts, most notably regarding disabled people.</p> <p>\u201cStrong genes!\u201d Alexandra says, smiling at the other two. It\u2019s not just that, I say. Your careers seem to reflect your father\u2019s. Another smile. \u201cIt\u2019s so strange,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cWe think about it all the time. We have split his passions between the three of us.\u201d</p>    <p>It\u2019s 20 years since Reeve died, 29 years since he broke his neck after being thrown from his horse, and 46 years since the first of his four Superman films came out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/06/superman-review-christopher-reeve-superhero-origin-movie-richard-donner\">That film</a> broke any number of box-office records and made Reeve a global star. Nobody mastered the screwball comedy of Superman and his bumbling alter ego reporter Clark Kent as convincingly as Reeve.</p> <p>By the time he died, nine years after he was paralysed from the neck down, we realised that Reeve had a touch of Superman himself. But we didn\u2019t know what a complex man he was. Now a new documentary, featuring his children and numerous household names, chronicles his life in all its intricate layers. The film has just had its British premiere at the London film festival, and we are meeting at a London hotel to chat about it. While Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story documents a unique individual, it also provides lessons for all of us. To distil it to its essence, how do we cope when the shit really hits the fan?</p>    <p>Reeve was born in New York into a well-to-do American family that goes back to the Pilgrim Fathers on his maternal side. His paternal grandfather was chief executive of the Prudential life insurance company, his father Franklin a poet and professor of literature, and his mother Barbara a journalist. Reeve had a privileged, successful and troubled childhood. He appeared to have it all: he was handsome, academic, a gifted actor and musician, and a natural sportsman. Yet he felt he could never be good enough to satisfy his father. His parents divorced when he was four, both going on to remarry and have more children. The family became forked and knotted. He didn\u2019t quite know how he fitted in, or with whom. Reeve promised himself that when he grew up he would stay with the mother of his children and not make excessive demands of his offspring.</p> <p>Yet it turned out he had more of his father\u2019s genes than he had hoped, for good and bad. He sailed through exams, did well at everything he put his mind to, and turned out to be just as competitive as Franklin. After a trip to France in his teens, he returned home fluent in French \u2013 he\u2019d not spoken a word of English in his time there. He went to the elite Cornell university and was one of 20 candidates out of 2,000 to win a place to study drama at the even more elite Juilliard School. He and his best friend Robin Williams were the only students in their years selected for the Juilliard\u2019s advanced course.</p>    <p>At the age of 23, he auditioned for A Matter of Gravity on Broadway starring Katharine Hepburn, and was cast as her grandson. At the same time, he was appearing on TV in the soap opera Love of Life. He was so exhausted and living off such a poor diet that he fainted before he got his first line out. But it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 Hepburn had taken a shine to him.</p> <p>He took his theatre extremely seriously, as did his peers and his father. When he told his actor friend William Hurt he had an audition to play Superman in a movie, Hurt warned Reeve against selling out. Not that there was any chance of him getting the part. A number of stars coveted the role, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Neil Diamond, while Al Pacino, Sylvester Stallone and Dustin Hoffman were considered, and Robert Redford and Clint Eastwood turned it down. When he was cast \u2013 against all expectation \u2013 Franklin bought a bottle of champagne to celebrate with him. But he had misheard. He thought Reeve had got a part in the Bernard Shaw play Man and Superman.</p> <p>Would Franklin really have preferred Reeve to get a part in a tiny production of Man and Superman to playing the lead role in a blockbuster movie? \u201cSeems like it!\u201d Matthew says. \u201cIf you think about it, he was a literature professor, so theatre was the way of connecting with his son. Theatre is high art, not mainstream, commercial film.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very traditional style of hard parenting,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cIn the US we call it Waspy parenting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPatrician!\u201d says Matthew, who seems anything but.</p> <p>At the height of his success, Reeve and his father stopped talking for a number of years.</p> <p>By the time of Superman II, Reeve was one of the world\u2019s biggest stars. He was also now a father. Reeve had a relationship with British modelling executive Gae Exton, then left her for Jane Seymour, only to return to Gae when he discovered she was pregnant with Matthew. He and Gae went on to have Alexandra three years later, and lived in Britain where the Superman films were made.</p> <p>As a little boy, Matthew remembers it dawning on him that his father was special. \u201cKids would come up and they\u2019d want to spend time with him and get his autograph, but we still had a pretty normal childhood. It wasn\u2019t California. We lived in London and New York for a reason \u2013 to have slightly more of a traditional upbringing.\u201d Did Reeve enjoy his fame? \u201cI think he took pride in how people connected with him, and the role of Superman in particular. It was fun to have kids come up, and he felt an obligation to live up to the hope that the kids were putting on you.\u201d</p>    <p>Despite Reeve\u2019s resolution, he and Gae split up when Matthew was seven and Alexandra was three. And despite his determination not to ape his father\u2019s parenting, he did. He expected the best from his children, whether it was schoolwork, table manners or sporting prowess. Alexandra says he didn\u2019t treat children differently from adults, which was great in a way, not so good in others.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, we\u2019d be skiing, and he would see the \u2018double black diamond\u2019 run for expert skiers. For Dad, it doesn\u2019t matter your age, you just do it.\u201d How old was she? \u201cAbout six.\u201d That\u2019s crazy, I say. She laughs. \u201cHis position was you could take it at a slower pace. He\u2019d bomb down to the bottom and wait for you.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was tennis. \u201cWhenever he played, he played hard \u2013 even against a child.\u201d It never crossed his mind, she says, that he shouldn\u2019t serve at full strength against her.</p> <p>Was this his way of teaching you or because he didn\u2019t distinguish between kids and adults? \u201cI think he was just an intense dude!\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t slow down!\u201d</p> <p>Will chips in: \u201cHe was just a type A personality. Very alpha.\u201d Reeve was also a licensed pilot who flew solo twice across the Atlantic.</p> <p>Who\u2019s the most alpha of you three, I ask.</p> <p>Will: \u201cNo offence, Matthew, but intellectually, it\u2019s Alexandra.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you had claimed that it was me, I would have challenged you,\u201d Matthew says. \u201cWith Dad, you had to make an effort. He had low tolerance for low effort.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an incredible clip in the documentary of the 27-year-old Reeve calling out Marlon Brando (who was paid $3.5m for two weeks\u2019 work on Superman) for phoning in his performance. It was brave, I say.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t see that as brave,\u201d Will says.</p> <p>\u201cThat reveals his personality so well \u2013 it\u2019s like you have to try,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cIt\u2019s true of Marlon Brando, it\u2019s true of your children, it\u2019s true of yourself. He was endearingly earnest.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s another telling moment in the film when the young Matthew tells Reeve he\u2019s not so different from his own father. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be like Franklin, but as much as he tried not to emulate him, he inadvertently did,\u201d Matthew says today.</p> <p>The children say that Reeve was different from Franklin in a crucial way: he showed them so much love. \u201cWhile Dad felt that he could never do anything well enough for Franklin, we did not have that at all as kids,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cSo his way of connecting with us was intense, but he was also full of pride. He celebrated every single thing we did.\u201d</p> <p>In 1987, Reeve met Dana Morosini, a singer and actor. He adored her, but he was still terrified of committing. He went into therapy to talk about his fear of marriage, and eventually he proposed. They married in April 1992, when she was six months pregnant with Will. Both Dana and Gae come across in the film as heroic \u2013 warm, loving, patient, the supportive hand the kids needed as they braved the double black diamond.</p>    <p>Reeve was back living in the US now. His Superman stint finished after four movies. Even when he was making them, he would return every summer to appear at the local theatre in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he had started as an apprentice and now had a holiday home. He was looking to play more serious parts, in theatre and cinema. Despite impressive performances in Merchant Ivory\u2019s The Bostonians and The Remains of the Day, it wasn\u2019t easy to get cast in the roles he was hoping for. Theatre was a little easier, and his choices were bold. But even here he met with limited success.</p> <p>Did he think he had become stereotyped? \u201cHe knew it was hard to get some roles after Superman or for audiences to connect with him,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cJeff Daniels says the audience just wasn\u2019t ready to see him in the play Fifth of July, where Jeff and Dad play gay lovers. Dad felt those limitations. He wanted to keep pushing himself creatively, but audiences wanted to see him in a particular role because they were used to seeing him as Superman.\u201d However much it stymied him creatively, Alexandra says, Superman gave him a great platform.</p> <p>In the 1980s, still a young man, he spent much of his time campaigning on industry-related issues such as arts funding, and broader subjects including human rights and the environment.</p> <p>In 1987, Chile\u2019s rightwing dictator, Augusto Pinochet, threatened to execute 77 actors. Reeve flew out to Santiago, led a protest march and helped save their lives. A cartoon ran in a newspaper showing Reeve carrying Pinochet by the collar with the caption: \u201cWhere will you take him, Superman?\u201d Reeve was later awarded the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Bernardo_O%27Higgins\">Grand Cross of the Bernardo O\u2019Higgins Order</a>, the highest Chilean distinction for foreigners.</p> <p>\u201cThe way I remember spending time with him in the 80s is him attached to his fax machine doing advocacy work,\u201d Alexandra says.</p> <p>Did he regard himself as political?</p> <p>\u201c<em>Yes!</em>\u201d all three chorus, proudly.</p> <p>\u201cSomebody asked him once whether he would run for Congress, and he went: \u2018Run for Congress? And lose my influence in Washington?\u2019\u201d Will says. \u201cHe knew that because he could straddle the world of activism, but also not fully be an animal of that world, his voice cut through.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995, he made his final film before the accident, Above Suspicion, in which he played a police officer paralysed after a shootout. A decade earlier, Reeve had learned to ride horses for an adaptation of Anna Karenina, and by now he was a serious equestrian competitor. On 27 May 1995, in the week after the premiere of Above Suspicion, he was competing in Culpeper, Virginia, when his horse threw him. He landed on his head, and broke his neck. The world was in shock. It wasn\u2019t simply a superstar who had been paralysed \u2013 it was Superman.</p> <p>The subsequent surgery was radical and could easily have killed him. \u201cIn the film, Will says he literally had his head re-attached to his body,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cHe\u2019s scarred my children for life with that phrase!\u201d And is it accurate? \u201cI don\u2019t know if the medical profession would use that phrase! They were upfront that it was 50-50 whether he would survive that surgery. I remember before the surgery going in to say our goodbyes because we knew he might not make it through.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew: \u201cThe way I remember it, it was like 50-50 that he would make it till tomorrow for a while. Like every day, regardless of the surgery.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, we hear audio of Reeve saying: \u201cI ruined my life and everybody else\u2019s. I won\u2019t be able to ski, sail, throw a ball to Will. Won\u2019t be able to make love to Dana. Maybe we should let me go.\u201d Dana convinced him to continue living. In the audio, Reeve says: \u201cAnd then she said the words that saved my life: \u2018You\u2019re still you. And I love you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Were the children aware that initially he wanted to die? \u201cNo,\u201d Alexandra says. Dana and Gae protected them from that. \u201cIt was just dawning on him how different life was going to be. Not just for him, but for all of us, is how he frames it.<br><br>\u201cHe would have been the first person to say he had moments when he felt bitter. It certainly wasn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. Of course he had days when he got pissed off at the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Robin Williams also convinced him life was still worth living. Soon after the accident, Williams visited him in hospital disguised as a Russian proctologist, telling him he needed an internal examination to see if he was still in working order. When Williams finally revealed himself, Reeve realised he could still laugh.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/12/robin-williams\">Williams took his own life in 2014</a>. In the film, Glenn Close talks about the exceptional friendship between the two men, saying: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that Robin Williams would still be alive if Christopher Reeve were, too.\u201d The children say Williams played such an important part in their father\u2019s life. \u201cHe showed what it is to be a friend and to show up for somebody,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cAnd his ex-wife Marsha is still incredibly close to us today.\u201d</p>    <p>Reeve not only survived, but thrived. He made his first public appearance after the accident at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffSy3-PJ5QI\">1996 Academy Awards</a> \u2013 one of the most moving moments at any Oscars ceremony. He looked gorgeous in his tux, and the standing ovation went on for an eternity. It had been a huge effort getting him from New York to Los Angeles. When the applause finally died down, he joked: \u201cWhat you probably don\u2019t know is that I left New York last September and I just arrived here this morning.\u201d He used the opportunity to talk about \u201cthe power of film to present painful but important issues to the public\u201d and \u201cput social issues ahead of box-office success\u201d. He rarely wasted an opportunity to talk about what mattered to him.</p> <p>He went on to write two memoirs, as well as campaign to raise benefits for people with long-term disabilities, and secure more funding for spinal cord injury research. He told the world that he would one day walk again, hopefully by his 50th birthday (something even he couldn\u2019t manage). He acted in films, notably playing a paralysed man in a remake of Hitchcock\u2019s Rear Window, and directed films for the first time: In the Gloaming, a movie about a son with Aids returning to the family home to die; and the documentary The Brooke Ellison Story, about a quadriplegic girl\u2019s battle to get into college. Perhaps most impressive of all, he taught himself to breathe independently for up to 90 minutes without a ventilator.</p> <p>Was he as competitive as he had been before the accident? \u201cI would say driven rather than competitive,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cThere was an intense focus on pushing his body beyond what the doctors told him it was capable of doing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was now competitive with himself,\u201d Matthew says. \u201cIf he breathed off the ventilator for 30 minutes on the Tuesday, on Wednesday it would have to be 31 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Do the siblings think their father changed after the accident? Alexandra says the whole family changed: \u201cOne of the residing feelings in our household is extreme gratitude. We didn\u2019t walk around saying \u2018thank you\u2019 all the time, but there was a newfound appreciation among all of us for the way you spend time together, finding joy in the small moments. And the way we spent time together dramatically changed, so rather than being out and being active, the way you connected was just sitting in his office chatting. Which teenager sits and talks to their parents for two hours at a stretch? And suddenly that\u2019s the way we connected.\u201d</p>    <p>Reeve now spent time watching the world from his wheelchair. Did he become wiser? \u201cI don\u2019t know if he was wiser,\u201d Alexandra says, \u201cbut he certainly had more perspective. Knowing how fragile things can be. Knowing not to sweat the small stuff. Knowing to be grateful for things you normally take for granted. That was probably the biggest change because it makes you reassess your relationships. It makes you bury the stupid quibbles and reforge friendships.\u201d Crucially, he and Franklin made up after the accident.</p> <p>Will, who was just shy of three at the time of the accident, says he\u2019s not sure if his memories of Reeve before that time are real or forged by photographs and stories he\u2019s been told. Either way, he thinks of his father as a man of action. \u201cPrior to the accident, he could never sit still. The accident forced him to literally sit still, but figuratively he still couldn\u2019t. He continued to push himself in every way \u2013 to grow as a husband, father, contributor to society.\u201d</p> <p>Will possesses one item of his father\u2019s that he\u2019s particularly proud of. \u201cIt\u2019s a cover of the Wall Street Journal from 1997. He was gifted a gold plaque version of it, and the cover says: \u2018The Reeve effect.\u2019 There\u2019s a picture of him and a graph that just goes tttttrrrrrrruh.\u201d He arrows his left hand up to the sky. \u201cAnd that shows the awareness of, and money allocated to, spinal cord injury research after his accident. The fact that our dad became the face of a movement and had such a tangible impact on people\u2019s lives as a result was deeply important to him as a lasting legacy, and that continues today. If our dad believed in something, he would put his face, name and voice to it, and effect change. And he did a great job of that.\u201d</p> <p>On 9 October 2004, Reeve attended a hockey match Will was playing in. He always loved to see his children play sports. Reeve was being treated for an infected ulcer that caused sepsis. That night he went into cardiac arrest after taking an antibiotic for the infection and fell into a coma. The next day he died. He was only 52 and, despite everything, seemed to have many good years ahead of him.</p> <p>The children say it was Dana who got them through this period. By then, all three were living in the US. \u201cThose early days, we had paparazzi outside the house,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cIt was a zoo.\u201d She looks at the others. \u201cD\u2019you remember when they did a TV special and Dana took us into Dad\u2019s bedroom and we all watched? It was a day or two after Dad passed away. Dana taught us how to go through it.\u201d</p>    <p>Will was only 12. Matthew and Alexandra returned to their father\u2019s home to help Dana look after him. However crushing their grief, they weren\u2019t alone. Throughout the film, Dana emerges as the glue in the family \u2013 lovable, loyal and so solid.</p> <p>She seemed as much of a mother to you as to Will, I say to Matthew and Alexandra.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Absolutely</em>,\u201d they reply in unison.</p> <p>\u201cShe came into my life when I was three,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a time in my life without Dana. So she was that figure from the very beginning for me.\u201d</p> <p>Tragedy hadn\u2019t finished with the Reeve family. A year later, Dana was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, and 18 months after Reeve passed away she also died. She was 44 and had never smoked. Even though we only see her in flashback in the film, she is every bit as much its star as Reeve. Her death hits us like a slap across the face.</p> <p>In the film, Will says: \u201cDespite the love and security that my siblings provided me, and my family provided me, and my adoptive family provides me, that was the moment, 6 March 2006 \u2026 I\u2019ve been alone since then.\u201d It\u2019s heartbreaking.</p> <p>When I mention it today, he stresses how important the love of his siblings, his adoptive family and his girlfriend has been. At times, Matthew and Alexandra watch him talk with a pride and concern bordering on the parental. I mention it to them. They laugh it off, but they know there\u2019s some truth in it.</p> <p>\u201cThose shoes are too big for any person to claim to fill, but we are definitely proud older siblings,\u201d Alexandra says.</p> <p>\u201cThey fill a middle space between parents and siblings for me,\u201d Will says.</p> <p>I ask why they agreed to take part in the film, after not talking publicly about their father for so long. They say that the time seemed right \u2013 20 years since his death \u2013 not so close to his life that it\u2019s too painful, and not too far that he\u2019s forgotten. But as much as anything, they say it\u2019s lovely to have his life documented for their families. Matthew and Alexandra have two children each (Alexandra\u2019s son is called Christopher), while Will has a long-term girlfriend.</p> <p>It\u2019s amazing how often the siblings finish each other\u2019s sentences; how symbiotic they seem. You sense that the death of Reeve and Dana has made them even closer. It\u2019s remarkable that you\u2019re so balanced and functional after what you\u2019ve all been through \u2013 it would screw up so many families, I say. \u201cWe\u2019d been given the tools,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make it easy, but we\u2019d been taught from a young age how you navigate crises. You keep breathing, you hug your loved ones really close and you just put one foot in front of the other.\u201d</p> <p>She pauses, and looks at the others. \u201cThere\u2019s this Pablo Neruda quote Dad used to have up on the wall: \u2018From strong roots grow flourishing leaves.\u2019 And we had very strong roots.\u201d</p> <p><em>Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story is in cinemas </em><em>in the UK and Ireland</em><em> from 1 November</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s eerie being in a room with the Reeve siblings. All three are dead ringers for their father, Christopher. Matthew, 44, resembles Reeve as Clark Kent. Alexandra, 40, shares his angular beauty. The youngest, Will, 32, looks like him as Superman. They are almost as tall as their 6ft 4in father: Will is 6ft 3in, Alexandra 6ft and Matthew 6ft 2in. As for their jobs, Matthew makes films, Alexandra is a legislation lawyer based in Washington DC and Will is a TV sports journalist. Their father was a sport-obsessed actor-turned-director who campaigned to change the law on a number of fronts, most notably regarding disabled people. \u201cStrong genes!\u201d Alexandra says, smiling at the other two. It\u2019s not just that, I say. Your careers seem to reflect your father\u2019s. Another smile. \u201cIt\u2019s so strange,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cWe think about it all the time. We have split his passions between the three of us.\u201d It\u2019s 20 years since Reeve died, 29 years since he broke his neck after being thrown from his horse, and 46 years since the first of his four Superman films came out. That film broke any number of box-office records and made Reeve a global star. Nobody mastered the screwball comedy of Superman and his bumbling alter ego reporter Clark Kent as convincingly as Reeve. By the time he died, nine years after he was paralysed from the neck down, we realised that Reeve had a touch of Superman himself. But we didn\u2019t know what a complex man he was. Now a new documentary, featuring his children and numerous household names, chronicles his life in all its intricate layers. The film has just had its British premiere at the London film festival, and we are meeting at a London hotel to chat about it. While Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story documents a unique individual, it also provides lessons for all of us. To distil it to its essence, how do we cope when the shit really hits the fan? Reeve was born in New York into a well-to-do American family that goes back to the Pilgrim Fathers on his maternal side. His paternal grandfather was chief executive of the Prudential life insurance company, his father Franklin a poet and professor of literature, and his mother Barbara a journalist. Reeve had a privileged, successful and troubled childhood. He appeared to have it all: he was handsome, academic, a gifted actor and musician, and a natural sportsman. Yet he felt he could never be good enough to satisfy his father. His parents divorced when he was four, both going on to remarry and have more children. The family became forked and knotted. He didn\u2019t quite know how he fitted in, or with whom. Reeve promised himself that when he grew up he would stay with the mother of his children and not make excessive demands of his offspring. Yet it turned out he had more of his father\u2019s genes than he had hoped, for good and bad. He sailed through exams, did well at everything he put his mind to, and turned out to be just as competitive as Franklin. After a trip to France in his teens, he returned home fluent in French \u2013 he\u2019d not spoken a word of English in his time there. He went to the elite Cornell university and was one of 20 candidates out of 2,000 to win a place to study drama at the even more elite Juilliard School. He and his best friend Robin Williams were the only students in their years selected for the Juilliard\u2019s advanced course. At the age of 23, he auditioned for A Matter of Gravity on Broadway starring Katharine Hepburn, and was cast as her grandson. At the same time, he was appearing on TV in the soap opera Love of Life. He was so exhausted and living off such a poor diet that he fainted before he got his first line out. But it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 Hepburn had taken a shine to him. He took his theatre extremely seriously, as did his peers and his father. When he told his actor friend William Hurt he had an audition to play Superman in a movie, Hurt warned Reeve against selling out. Not that there was any chance of him getting the part. A number of stars coveted the role, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Neil Diamond, while Al Pacino, Sylvester Stallone and Dustin Hoffman were considered, and Robert Redford and Clint Eastwood turned it down. When he was cast \u2013 against all expectation \u2013 Franklin bought a bottle of champagne to celebrate with him. But he had misheard. He thought Reeve had got a part in the Bernard Shaw play Man and Superman. Would Franklin really have preferred Reeve to get a part in a tiny production of Man and Superman to playing the lead role in a blockbuster movie? \u201cSeems like it!\u201d Matthew says. \u201cIf you think about it, he was a literature professor, so theatre was the way of connecting with his son. Theatre is high art, not mainstream, commercial film.\u201d \u201cIt was a very traditional style of hard parenting,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cIn the US we call it Waspy parenting.\u201d \u201cPatrician!\u201d says Matthew, who seems anything but. At the height of his success, Reeve and his father stopped talking for a number of years. By the time of Superman II, Reeve was one of the world\u2019s biggest stars. He was also now a father. Reeve had a relationship with British modelling executive Gae Exton, then left her for Jane Seymour, only to return to Gae when he discovered she was pregnant with Matthew. He and Gae went on to have Alexandra three years later, and lived in Britain where the Superman films were made. As a little boy, Matthew remembers it dawning on him that his father was special. \u201cKids would come up and they\u2019d want to spend time with him and get his autograph, but we still had a pretty normal childhood. It wasn\u2019t California. We lived in London and New York for a reason \u2013 to have slightly more of a traditional upbringing.\u201d Did Reeve enjoy his fame? \u201cI think he took pride in how people connected with him, and the role of Superman in particular. It was fun to have kids come up, and he felt an obligation to live up to the hope that the kids were putting on you.\u201d Despite Reeve\u2019s resolution, he and Gae split up when Matthew was seven and Alexandra was three. And despite his determination not to ape his father\u2019s parenting, he did. He expected the best from his children, whether it was schoolwork, table manners or sporting prowess. Alexandra says he didn\u2019t treat children differently from adults, which was great in a way, not so good in others. \u201cFor example, we\u2019d be skiing, and he would see the \u2018double black diamond\u2019 run for expert skiers. For Dad, it doesn\u2019t matter your age, you just do it.\u201d How old was she? \u201cAbout six.\u201d That\u2019s crazy, I say. She laughs. \u201cHis position was you could take it at a slower pace. He\u2019d bomb down to the bottom and wait for you.\u201d Then there was tennis. \u201cWhenever he played, he played hard \u2013 even against a child.\u201d It never crossed his mind, she says, that he shouldn\u2019t serve at full strength against her. Was this his way of teaching you or because he didn\u2019t distinguish between kids and adults? \u201cI think he was just an intense dude!\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t slow down!\u201d Will chips in: \u201cHe was just a type A personality. Very alpha.\u201d Reeve was also a licensed pilot who flew solo twice across the Atlantic. Who\u2019s the most alpha of you three, I ask. Will: \u201cNo offence, Matthew, but intellectually, it\u2019s Alexandra.\u201d \u201cIf you had claimed that it was me, I would have challenged you,\u201d Matthew says. \u201cWith Dad, you had to make an effort. He had low tolerance for low effort.\u201d There\u2019s an incredible clip in the documentary of the 27-year-old Reeve calling out Marlon Brando (who was paid $3.5m for two weeks\u2019 work on Superman) for phoning in his performance. It was brave, I say. \u201cHe didn\u2019t see that as brave,\u201d Will says. \u201cThat reveals his personality so well \u2013 it\u2019s like you have to try,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cIt\u2019s true of Marlon Brando, it\u2019s true of your children, it\u2019s true of yourself. He was endearingly earnest.\u201d There\u2019s another telling moment in the film when the young Matthew tells Reeve he\u2019s not so different from his own father. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be like Franklin, but as much as he tried not to emulate him, he inadvertently did,\u201d Matthew says today. The children say that Reeve was different from Franklin in a crucial way: he showed them so much love. \u201cWhile Dad felt that he could never do anything well enough for Franklin, we did not have that at all as kids,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cSo his way of connecting with us was intense, but he was also full of pride. He celebrated every single thing we did.\u201d In 1987, Reeve met Dana Morosini, a singer and actor. He adored her, but he was still terrified of committing. He went into therapy to talk about his fear of marriage, and eventually he proposed. They married in April 1992, when she was six months pregnant with Will. Both Dana and Gae come across in the film as heroic \u2013 warm, loving, patient, the supportive hand the kids needed as they braved the double black diamond. Reeve was back living in the US now. His Superman stint finished after four movies. Even when he was making them, he would return every summer to appear at the local theatre in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he had started as an apprentice and now had a holiday home. He was looking to play more serious parts, in theatre and cinema. Despite impressive performances in Merchant Ivory\u2019s The Bostonians and The Remains of the Day, it wasn\u2019t easy to get cast in the roles he was hoping for. Theatre was a little easier, and his choices were bold. But even here he met with limited success. Did he think he had become stereotyped? \u201cHe knew it was hard to get some roles after Superman or for audiences to connect with him,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cJeff Daniels says the audience just wasn\u2019t ready to see him in the play Fifth of July, where Jeff and Dad play gay lovers. Dad felt those limitations. He wanted to keep pushing himself creatively, but audiences wanted to see him in a particular role because they were used to seeing him as Superman.\u201d However much it stymied him creatively, Alexandra says, Superman gave him a great platform. In the 1980s, still a young man, he spent much of his time campaigning on industry-related issues such as arts funding, and broader subjects including human rights and the environment. In 1987, Chile\u2019s rightwing dictator, Augusto Pinochet, threatened to execute 77 actors. Reeve flew out to Santiago, led a protest march and helped save their lives. A cartoon ran in a newspaper showing Reeve carrying Pinochet by the collar with the caption: \u201cWhere will you take him, Superman?\u201d Reeve was later awarded the Grand Cross of the Bernardo O\u2019Higgins Order, the highest Chilean distinction for foreigners. \u201cThe way I remember spending time with him in the 80s is him attached to his fax machine doing advocacy work,\u201d Alexandra says. Did he regard himself as political? \u201cYes!\u201d all three chorus, proudly. \u201cSomebody asked him once whether he would run for Congress, and he went: \u2018Run for Congress? And lose my influence in Washington?\u2019\u201d Will says. \u201cHe knew that because he could straddle the world of activism, but also not fully be an animal of that world, his voice cut through.\u201d In 1995, he made his final film before the accident, Above Suspicion, in which he played a police officer paralysed after a shootout. A decade earlier, Reeve had learned to ride horses for an adaptation of Anna Karenina, and by now he was a serious equestrian competitor. On 27 May 1995, in the week after the premiere of Above Suspicion, he was competing in Culpeper, Virginia, when his horse threw him. He landed on his head, and broke his neck. The world was in shock. It wasn\u2019t simply a superstar who had been paralysed \u2013 it was Superman. The subsequent surgery was radical and could easily have killed him. \u201cIn the film, Will says he literally had his head re-attached to his body,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cHe\u2019s scarred my children for life with that phrase!\u201d And is it accurate? \u201cI don\u2019t know if the medical profession would use that phrase! They were upfront that it was 50-50 whether he would survive that surgery. I remember before the surgery going in to say our goodbyes because we knew he might not make it through.\u201d Matthew: \u201cThe way I remember it, it was like 50-50 that he would make it till tomorrow for a while. Like every day, regardless of the surgery.\u201d In the film, we hear audio of Reeve saying: \u201cI ruined my life and everybody else\u2019s. I won\u2019t be able to ski, sail, throw a ball to Will. Won\u2019t be able to make love to Dana. Maybe we should let me go.\u201d Dana convinced him to continue living. In the audio, Reeve says: \u201cAnd then she said the words that saved my life: \u2018You\u2019re still you. And I love you.\u2019\u201d Were the children aware that initially he wanted to die? \u201cNo,\u201d Alexandra says. Dana and Gae protected them from that. \u201cIt was just dawning on him how different life was going to be. Not just for him, but for all of us, is how he frames it. \u201cHe would have been the first person to say he had moments when he felt bitter. It certainly wasn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. Of course he had days when he got pissed off at the circumstances.\u201d Robin Williams also convinced him life was still worth living. Soon after the accident, Williams visited him in hospital disguised as a Russian proctologist, telling him he needed an internal examination to see if he was still in working order. When Williams finally revealed himself, Reeve realised he could still laugh. Williams took his own life in 2014. In the film, Glenn Close talks about the exceptional friendship between the two men, saying: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that Robin Williams would still be alive if Christopher Reeve were, too.\u201d The children say Williams played such an important part in their father\u2019s life. \u201cHe showed what it is to be a friend and to show up for somebody,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cAnd his ex-wife Marsha is still incredibly close to us today.\u201d Reeve not only survived, but thrived. He made his first public appearance after the accident at the 1996 Academy Awards \u2013 one of the most moving moments at any Oscars ceremony. He looked gorgeous in his tux, and the standing ovation went on for an eternity. It had been a huge effort getting him from New York to Los Angeles. When the applause finally died down, he joked: \u201cWhat you probably don\u2019t know is that I left New York last September and I just arrived here this morning.\u201d He used the opportunity to talk about \u201cthe power of film to present painful but important issues to the public\u201d and \u201cput social issues ahead of box-office success\u201d. He rarely wasted an opportunity to talk about what mattered to him. He went on to write two memoirs, as well as campaign to raise benefits for people with long-term disabilities, and secure more funding for spinal cord injury research. He told the world that he would one day walk again, hopefully by his 50th birthday (something even he couldn\u2019t manage). He acted in films, notably playing a paralysed man in a remake of Hitchcock\u2019s Rear Window, and directed films for the first time: In the Gloaming, a movie about a son with Aids returning to the family home to die; and the documentary The Brooke Ellison Story, about a quadriplegic girl\u2019s battle to get into college. Perhaps most impressive of all, he taught himself to breathe independently for up to 90 minutes without a ventilator. Was he as competitive as he had been before the accident? \u201cI would say driven rather than competitive,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cThere was an intense focus on pushing his body beyond what the doctors told him it was capable of doing.\u201d \u201cHe was now competitive with himself,\u201d Matthew says. \u201cIf he breathed off the ventilator for 30 minutes on the Tuesday, on Wednesday it would have to be 31 minutes.\u201d Do the siblings think their father changed after the accident? Alexandra says the whole family changed: \u201cOne of the residing feelings in our household is extreme gratitude. We didn\u2019t walk around saying \u2018thank you\u2019 all the time, but there was a newfound appreciation among all of us for the way you spend time together, finding joy in the small moments. And the way we spent time together dramatically changed, so rather than being out and being active, the way you connected was just sitting in his office chatting. Which teenager sits and talks to their parents for two hours at a stretch? And suddenly that\u2019s the way we connected.\u201d Reeve now spent time watching the world from his wheelchair. Did he become wiser? \u201cI don\u2019t know if he was wiser,\u201d Alexandra says, \u201cbut he certainly had more perspective. Knowing how fragile things can be. Knowing not to sweat the small stuff. Knowing to be grateful for things you normally take for granted. That was probably the biggest change because it makes you reassess your relationships. It makes you bury the stupid quibbles and reforge friendships.\u201d Crucially, he and Franklin made up after the accident. Will, who was just shy of three at the time of the accident, says he\u2019s not sure if his memories of Reeve before that time are real or forged by photographs and stories he\u2019s been told. Either way, he thinks of his father as a man of action. \u201cPrior to the accident, he could never sit still. The accident forced him to literally sit still, but figuratively he still couldn\u2019t. He continued to push himself in every way \u2013 to grow as a husband, father, contributor to society.\u201d Will possesses one item of his father\u2019s that he\u2019s particularly proud of. \u201cIt\u2019s a cover of the Wall Street Journal from 1997. He was gifted a gold plaque version of it, and the cover says: \u2018The Reeve effect.\u2019 There\u2019s a picture of him and a graph that just goes tttttrrrrrrruh.\u201d He arrows his left hand up to the sky. \u201cAnd that shows the awareness of, and money allocated to, spinal cord injury research after his accident. The fact that our dad became the face of a movement and had such a tangible impact on people\u2019s lives as a result was deeply important to him as a lasting legacy, and that continues today. If our dad believed in something, he would put his face, name and voice to it, and effect change. And he did a great job of that.\u201d On 9 October 2004, Reeve attended a hockey match Will was playing in. He always loved to see his children play sports. Reeve was being treated for an infected ulcer that caused sepsis. That night he went into cardiac arrest after taking an antibiotic for the infection and fell into a coma. The next day he died. He was only 52 and, despite everything, seemed to have many good years ahead of him. The children say it was Dana who got them through this period. By then, all three were living in the US. \u201cThose early days, we had paparazzi outside the house,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cIt was a zoo.\u201d She looks at the others. \u201cD\u2019you remember when they did a TV special and Dana took us into Dad\u2019s bedroom and we all watched? It was a day or two after Dad passed away. Dana taught us how to go through it.\u201d Will was only 12. Matthew and Alexandra returned to their father\u2019s home to help Dana look after him. However crushing their grief, they weren\u2019t alone. Throughout the film, Dana emerges as the glue in the family \u2013 lovable, loyal and so solid. She seemed as much of a mother to you as to Will, I say to Matthew and Alexandra. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d they reply in unison. \u201cShe came into my life when I was three,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a time in my life without Dana. So she was that figure from the very beginning for me.\u201d Tragedy hadn\u2019t finished with the Reeve family. A year later, Dana was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, and 18 months after Reeve passed away she also died. She was 44 and had never smoked. Even though we only see her in flashback in the film, she is every bit as much its star as Reeve. Her death hits us like a slap across the face. In the film, Will says: \u201cDespite the love and security that my siblings provided me, and my family provided me, and my adoptive family provides me, that was the moment, 6 March 2006 \u2026 I\u2019ve been alone since then.\u201d It\u2019s heartbreaking. When I mention it today, he stresses how important the love of his siblings, his adoptive family and his girlfriend has been. At times, Matthew and Alexandra watch him talk with a pride and concern bordering on the parental. I mention it to them. They laugh it off, but they know there\u2019s some truth in it. \u201cThose shoes are too big for any person to claim to fill, but we are definitely proud older siblings,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cThey fill a middle space between parents and siblings for me,\u201d Will says. I ask why they agreed to take part in the film, after not talking publicly about their father for so long. They say that the time seemed right \u2013 20 years since his death \u2013 not so close to his life that it\u2019s too painful, and not too far that he\u2019s forgotten. But as much as anything, they say it\u2019s lovely to have his life documented for their families. Matthew and Alexandra have two children each (Alexandra\u2019s son is called Christopher), while Will has a long-term girlfriend. It\u2019s amazing how often the siblings finish each other\u2019s sentences; how symbiotic they seem. You sense that the death of Reeve and Dana has made them even closer. It\u2019s remarkable that you\u2019re so balanced and functional after what you\u2019ve all been through \u2013 it would screw up so many families, I say. \u201cWe\u2019d been given the tools,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make it easy, but we\u2019d been taught from a young age how you navigate crises. You keep breathing, you hug your loved ones really close and you just put one foot in front of the other.\u201d She pauses, and looks at the others. \u201cThere\u2019s this Pablo Neruda quote Dad used to have up on the wall: \u2018From strong roots grow flourishing leaves.\u2019 And we had very strong roots.\u201d Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story is in cinemas in the UK and Ireland from 1 November",

He was 66. Olsen \u2013 who changed his name legally from Ian Christopher Olsen to Ollie Jngbert Christian Olsen in the early 90s \u2013 had been inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame earlier this month, with the organisation describing him as \u201ca true artist and visionary in every sense of the word\u201d.

Howard\u2019s classic Shivers was originally a Young Charlatans song, later recorded by the Birthday Party under their early name the Boys Next Door. But Olsen had perennially itchy feet. Moving away from guitars, he formed Whirlywirld, pushing into the much harder, synthesizer-based territory then occupied by New York pioneers Suicide and the UK\u2019s Throbbing Gristle \u2013 a sound Depeche Mode would spend the rest of their careers chasing and refining, with infinitely greater success. Whirlywirld played a grand total of 14 gigs as part of Melbourne\u2019s so-called \u201clittle band\u201d scene (Olsen initially refused to play live), releasing two EPs before Olsen relocated to London in 1980 on the recommendation of an impressed Iggy Pop.

In 2023, Magic Dirt singer Adalita collaborated with Mick Harvey and Models\u2019 Andrew Duffield on a cover of Rooms for the Memory to raise funds towards his care. Olsen died peacefully with his wife Jayne, whom he married on 9 October, by his side. Among a flood of tributes from fellow musicians, Tony Buck \u2013 drummer and percussionist for internationally celebrated improvisational trio the Necks \u2013 described him simply as \u201cone of the greats\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2024 to correct the release date of Adalita\u2019s collaboration with Mick Harvey and Andrew Duffield, and to clarify that Rooms for the Memory was the only piece of music recorded under Hutchence\u2019s own name during his lifetime. The headline was also amended to refer to Ollie Olsen by his legal name.",

Randwick council closed Coogee beach on Tuesday afternoon after lifeguards discovered the golf ball-sized objects. The council also closed nearby Gordons Bay on Wednesday afternoon, stating \u201cmore mysterious, sphere-shaped debris\u201d had been found washed up. On Thursday, authorities said they had closed five more beaches, including Bondi, Tamarama, Bronte, Clovelly and the northern end of Maroubra, bringing the total number of beaches closed to seven. According to Randwick council, preliminary testing shows the balls are a hydrocarbon-based pollutant, consistent with the makeup of tar balls. Here is everything you need to know. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email What is a tar ball? A tar ball is a blob of a petroleum which has travelled through the ocean and collected debris, says Louise Morris, the oil and gas campaign manager at the Australian Marine Conservation Society. \u201cIt is a fossil fuel pollution which has attached itself, because it is super sticky, to whatever it comes in contact with that is floating in the ocean.\u201d After a spill from a rig, for example, petroleum is often washed in waves and currents, making it condense and coagulate, Morris says. \u201cThe more it keeps gripping on to other substances, it solidifies and condenses. \u201cPart of that process of washing through the ocean means that they form a spherical shape.\u201d Some tar balls fall to the bottom of the ocean, while others containing more air will float. It is not unusual for tar balls to end up on shores. The Gulf of Mexico, which has natural oil seeps, commonly has tar balls \u2013 \u201cwhich often look a little bit more like pancakes\u201d \u2013 wash up on beaches, says Dr Sharon Hook, CSIRO principal research scientist. \u201cThe thing is, you don\u2019t normally get hundreds of them all at once.\u201d Is this case unusual? Some experts were initially uncertain about whether the objects were tar balls. One of the unusual things was that \u201cwe got so many all of a sudden\u201d, Hook says. Because the balls are so uniform and round, andhave only been deposited in a small environment, it \u201cmay mean it probably happened close\u201d. \u201cBut anything could happen,\u201d she says. Oil spills usually stain sand and leave a sheen on the surface of water, Hook adds. Port authorities said no oil spills have been self-reported by any vessel operators. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible that it happened without this, but it is unusual,\u201d Hook says. What impact could the balls have on the environment? For the hundreds of tar balls found on the shore, there would be \u201cat least half of that again in the ocean\u201d, Morris says. That could be a problem for marine life. Coogee is home to various shark species and is a humpback whale migration zone. \u201cIf there are tar balls floating around below the ocean surface, or some of them have just sunk to the bottom, all of our marine life and a whole food ecosystem is impacted.\u201d \u201cTar can be sticky,\u201d Hook says. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the heartbreaking pictures of birds and other animals coated in oil after a spill; we wouldn\u2019t want them to come in contract with this and be coated with a substance that is either toxic or destroys the weatherproofing of their feathers.\u201d If animals ingest the debris, that could block their stomach and stop them digesting food. Morris\u2019s concern is less about the volume of debris but how long tar balls last. \u201cBecause it is a petroleum product, and it is probably attached to a lot of plastic, this is decades if not hundreds of years of pollutants that can be existing and disintegrating and changing shape in our marine environment.\u201d What about the risk to humans? Hook says authorities were right to close the beaches. Tar balls are full of carcinogenic chemicals, she says. \u201cYou certainly would not want your kid to be planted making a sand castle next to it.\u201d Morris says this mystery deposit is a reminder to government. \u201cWe need to stop all new fossil fuel developments and \u2026 clean up the existing rigs and oil ships that are in our ocean already,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know the pollution is happening.

The 28-year-old man is alleged to have met the teenage girl online, groomed and threatened her in an attempt to force her to send him footage of herself doing \u201cvarious compromising acts\u201d, according to a New South Wales police statement. The man allegedly connected with the child in October 2023, and over the following nine months had conversations with her on a number of different platforms, Det Supt Jayne Doherty, commander of the NSW sex crimes squad, said at a press conference. Communication included playing games with the child for up to six hours a day, and purchasing game cards \u201cto keep her engaged\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email During that time, police allege the man coerced the child to commit acts of self harm and sexual acts \u201cfor his own sexual gratification\u201d, Doherty said. Police will allege he threatened to abduct, rape and kill the child in online conversations, Doherty said. The child reached out to Kids Helpline. The man was arrested by detectives at about 7.35am on Wednesday at an address in Safety Beach, 30km north of Coffs Harbour. Police seized electronic devices during a search of the property, which will undergo forensic examination. The man was charged with \u201cusing a carriage service to engage in sexual activity with a child, to do/plan harm to person under 16 years, to groom under 16 years for sex, to threaten to kill, to threaten to serious harm, to send indecent material to person under 16 years, and to cause child sexual activity\u201d, the NSW police statement said. He was refused bail and appeared in Coffs Harbour local court the same day. The charge comes after an NSW sex crimes squad investigation into alleged sadistic sextortion commenced in August 2024 after a referral from Queensland police. The Australian federal police warned parents and guardians of the dangers of sadistic sextortion in September, claiming that children as young as 12 are being coerced into producing extreme content, from sex acts to self harm, over the internet at a rising rate. \u201cSadistic sextortion is unlike typical cases of sextortion because the offender is not doing it for financial gain, rather victims are being coerced into producing extreme sexual and violent content,\u201d Doherty said in a statement. \u201cWe want children to know there is always someone who will listen, and there are things we can do to get you out of any situation, no matter how frightening it is or what the offender is telling you.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "New South Wales crossbenchers are threatening to withhold their support for legislation unless the Minns government moves to end native forest logging in the state, as greater glider populations remain at risk. The Legalise Cannabis MP Jeremy Buckingham and Greens environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said it was time for the premier, Chris Minns, to take the issue seriously. Higginson on Thursday said native logging was contentious within Labor, with many MPs and rank and file party members calling for a transition to logging only plantation forests. Plantations grown specifically for timber production are generally a single species of tree and are considered less likely to be home to animals such as greater gliders than native forests. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Higginson said expert advice was that more lucrative timber products came from plantations rather than \u201cour previous public native\u201d forests. \u201cWe know that the products coming out of our precious public native forest estates are not those high value products that people every day in NSW rely on,\u201d she said. It comes after weeks of community protests over logging in endangered greater glider habitat, including at Bulga state forest in the state\u2019s mid-north, and the release of new community surveys that detected triple the number of gliders than what was recorded by the state-owned forestry agency. Forest campaigners have called for an immediate moratorium on logging in greater glider habitat. The Forest Alliance of NSW said current regulations are a \u201clicence to kill\u201d the species, whose populations have already plummeted in the aftermath of the black summer bushfires. Their report, published on Thursday, said many of the 825 gliders they detected in four state forests where logging is scheduled could die because they would have insufficient protection under the state\u2019s forestry protocols. The data was gathered through on-ground and thermal drone surveys at Tallaganda and Tuggolo forests in the state\u2019s south and Bulga and Styx River in the north. There have been 16 arrests at Bulga state forest since campaigners began locking themselves to logging machinery about two weeks ago. The forest alliance\u2019s community surveys found 825 gliders across the four forests, while the Forestry Corporation of NSW\u2019s surveys found 229. The community surveys detected 170 glider den trees, compared to just 15 that were registered by the forestry agency. Den trees are significant because under state rules no logging is permitted within 50 metres of them. The report estimated less than 1% of den trees were being detected by the forestry corporation under the conditions of its logging approvals. Forestry Alliance of NSW spokesperson Justin Field called on the Minns government to save greater gliders from an industry that had \u201cproven it cannot operate in our native forests without sending species towards extinction\u201d. He said it should not be up to citizen scientists to do work state agencies were failing to do. \u201cThere is no doubt that a large proportion of the 825 greater gliders that the community has identified in these forests will be killed as a result of Forestry Corporation\u2019s hopelessly inadequate procedures,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state government is knowingly complicit in this destruction whilst it refuses to halt logging in these areas.\u201d A Forestry Corporation spokesperson said: \u201cThe claim that over 800 greater gliders will not be protected and may die in the next few months is misleading and has no basis in fact. \u201cForestry Corporation assures the community it is protecting the habitat for gliders.\u201d The report calls for an immediate moratorium on logging over all areas with a high density of greater gliders and for the Forestry Corporation to protect habitat at the location of all existing greater glider records \u2013 including records supplied by the community. The veteran forest campaigner Susie Russell, who was arrested after locking on to machinery at Bulga last week, said the government was wiping out greater glider habitat while promoting its \u201cnature positive\u201d agenda. \u201cNo one knows what they mean by nature positive if it doesn\u2019t include protecting the known homes of our most iconic and endangered fauna,\u201d she said. Forestry Corporation\u2019s spokesperson said the agency\u2019s ecologists had spent \u201cmore than 196 hours completing 418 spotlight surveys for gliders across more than 128km of forest roads, tracks and trails\u201d. They said this supplemented existing protection measures under the Coastal Integrated Forestry Operations Approval, which required the agency to set aside trees with hollows irrespective of whether those trees are identified as dens. \u201cAll areas of state forest that are harvested for timber are regrowth forests that have been harvested and regrown many times in the past,\u201d they said. \u201cThe fact that these forests continue to support strong populations of endangered species is testament to the effectiveness of the strict protection measures put in place by expert scientists.\u201d A Minns government spokesperson said the alliance report had \u201cinformed which trees need to be protected and the data on dens has been uploaded into Bionet\u201d. They said a consultation process was considering the future management of forestry operations, with an independent panel to advise on \u201chow to best balance sustainable timber supply with environmental commitments\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A child that faces a bedridden life. A girl with intellectual disabilities raped by a family member. Victims of domestic violence or reproductive coercion. There are a variety of distressing reasons women have later stage terminations. There is no easy definition of when an abortion is considered \u201clate\u201d or \u201clate-term\u201d. It is generally considered anything after 20 weeks\u2019 gestation, but the states and territories have a patchwork of legislation with various milestones. What is clear is that later terminations are the new target of anti-abortion activists, now that abortion has been decriminalised across Australia. On Wednesday South Australia\u2019s upper house held a conscience vote on legislation that would force women seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days \u2013 an extremely rare occurrence \u2013 to be induced, to deliver the child alive, and keep it or adopt it out. The bill was narrowly defeated with 10 votes opposed to 9 in favour. In dramatic late-night scenes, the Liberal MP Michelle Lensink, a vocal opponent of the bill, was prepared to race in to parliament to vote even though she is on leave for cancer treatment. She believed her Liberal colleague Jing Lee would pair her vote \u2013 a long-standing convention when votes are close and someone cannot attend. Lensink says she was watching the debate when Lee told her she didn\u2019t want to proceed with the pair. Lensink was then talking to One Nation MLC Sarah Game, and Lensink claims Game agreed to pair, but then also withdrew. Lensink says she considered rushing in. \u201cI got in an Uber, just in case, then I got the call \u2018you don\u2019t have to come\u2019,\u201d she told ABC radio. At the last minute, the conservative Liberal MLC Dennis Hood \u2013 formerly of the Family First party and a passionate supporter of the bill \u2013 agreed to be the pair. The attorney general, Kyam Maher, described Hood as a politician he relied on to keep his word. \u201cIt was an entirely honourable thing to do,\u201d he said. Hood said Lensink had previously paired him on a conscience vote when he was ill. \u201cSo I said to her if you ever need the favour returned I will do the right thing by you.\u201d Game said a conscience vote was inflammatory and that \u201cyou cannot rely on someone else being willing to pair out with you\u201d. She said she spoke to Lensink about pairing as she thought it might be a parliamentary requirement. But when she found out it was not, she told Lensink she would not pair. \u201cOut of respect for her, I made sure she was informed that wouldn\u2019t be happening to give her the best chance to see if someone else would,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life, this is not something where I would walk out and not have it count unless that was required. She might have been in some sort of confusion for a few minutes.\u201d Guardian Australia has contacted Lee for comment. The Liberal frontbencher Ben Hood, who introduced the bill, says the woman\u2019s right to end a pregnancy is kept because the pregnancy ends when the baby is born. \u201cThe innovation of this bill is that it allows a mother to end her pregnancy throughout all nine months and indeed right up to birth,\u201d he says. The Greens have a different label for it: \u201cforced birth\u201d. About 1% of all terminations are carried out after 20 weeks. According to SA Health data gathered in the 18 months after abortion reform in the state, fewer than five terminations were performed after 27 weeks. Terminations at that point can only be done with the approval of two doctors, and only if it is necessary to save the life of the pregnant person or save another foetus, or poses significant risk of injury or mental health of the pregnant person, or if there is a significant risk of serious foetal anomalies. Ben Hood said in the upper house on Wednesday night that his bill did not \u201cforce birth\u201d. He said any termination at 28 weeks already involved \u201cbirth\u201d because women had no other option in how to remove the foetus from the body. \u201cThe only difference is that the baby will have a chance to live,\u201d he said. He has previously said that, once born, if the baby \u201cisn\u2019t compatible with life\u201d, it would then be given palliative care. He said on Wednesday night the babies would be admitted to neonatal units, \u201creceiving the best medical attention available if the mother does not wish to keep the baby\u201d. Adoption would be a compassionate alternative, he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Maher says the \u201cTrumpian\u201d bill would wind back abortion care and poses a \u201creal and significant danger, not only to the physical health and safety of all women, but to women\u2019s fundamental right to bodily autonomy\u201d. He also hit out at the vitriol, nastiness and inflammatory attacks deployed in the campaign. \u201cI\u2019d encourage those who\u2019ve been involved in this sort of debate to reflect on whether the hyper polarised US style of personal politics really reflects well on SA,\u201d he says. The bill bears similarities to so-called \u201cborn-alive\u201d laws, which have percolated in the US for years. A federal \u201cborn alive\u201d bill in Australia was found to have no legal, ethical or medical basis to support it. The Katter\u2019s Australian party leader, Robbie Katter, has proposed similar legislation in Queensland. Both Katter and Ben Hood have thanked the anti-abortion activist Joanna Howe for her work on their legislation. Howe wants \u201can Australia where abortion is unthinkable\u201d. Hood thanked Howe on Wednesday and said the other people who informed the bill wanted to remain anonymous. Several earlier speakers noted that Hood\u2019s bill was drafted by Howe and anonymous experts while the review that informed decriminalisation involved thousands of experts and many respected institutions who did not remain anonymous, and that it involved months of investigation and a 560-page report. Abortion has also crept up as a serious issue in the lead-up to the Queensland election after Labor accused the Liberal National party of a \u201csecret plan\u201d to limit abortion rights and the LNP failed to quell the speculation. The various campaigns have been accused of using misinformation in an attempt to limit access to terminations. Reasons women might need a late termination include foetal abnormalities, life-threatening conditions, and psycho-social reasons such as the baby being the result of rape or incest. \u2018We can\u2019t do this to the baby\u2019 Tiffany\u2019s first baby had spina bifida. Her baby would have been paralysed from the neck down. She chose a termination. Six years later, Tiffany* was pregnant again. At the 20-week scan, she was told this baby also had spina bifida, but it was not as bad. \u201cThey said wait another two weeks, we\u2019ll do another scan and we\u2019ll go from there,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re stressing, you\u2019re freaking out. Two weeks felt like an eternity.\u201d After waiting two weeks and undergoing another scan, Tiffany was again told it didn\u2019t look too bad and she should do another scan in two weeks. \u201cAt 24 weeks, it got worse,\u201d she says. \u201cHe started developing fluid on the brain. It was affecting his nerves, down the spine. It went from numb toes to \u2018he\u2019s not going to be able to walk\u2019.\u201d Another two weeks, another scan. \u201cEverything was failing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe did all these tests because I needed to make sure I was making the right decision \u2026 we sat down and said \u2018we can\u2019t do this to the baby\u2019. He\u2019d be bedridden, have surgery after surgery, a lifetime of hospital visits.\u201d At 28 weeks, she had the procedure. An SA Law Reform Institute review of abortion law heard about a girl with an intellectual disability who had been sexually abused by a family member and did not realise she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy. She made it clear she did not want the pregnancy to proceed. If she had not been able to have an abortion, if she had been forced to have the child, it would have had a \u201csevere and adverse affect on her\u201d, the institute said in its report. Jacquie* and her husband had a two-year-old and another baby on the way. They did the usual testing, including a 16-week scan and an amniocentesis. \u201cWe got the results back and they said everything was fine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I had a gut feeling and remember saying to my hubby that something was just off.\u201d At 24 weeks, they got a call. \u201cThey said they got the results wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cWe thought, \u2018shit\u2019. So we were told at 24 weeks that our child did have Down syndrome and we had to make a choice within 24 hours. \u201cWe just had to make the decision around our family and what was best for us. To this day we never say it was the right decision. It was the best choice for us at that time. We had to think about our little one.\u201d Jacob Mangelsdorf is a counsellor at Red Tree Foundation, an organisation which supports people grieving the loss of a child. He says the parents that come to him are suffering an \u201cincredibly complex grief\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about an easy choice. We\u2019re not talking about something that\u2019s without a high level of complexity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just losing that baby, it\u2019s about processing that loss and the decision, [thinking] \u2018in some ways I made that choice to end that baby\u2019s life\u2019. \u201cThere\u2019s always that little part of their brain grappling with that. It\u2019s really important to acknowledge that the mum at that point has had 20-something weeks to bond with that baby.\u201d Tiffany says hospitals and health authorities need to do better in supporting women going through horrific experiences like hers. And people need to stop judging others, she says. \u201cEveryone has an opinion and their own beliefs. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not in my shoes, you don\u2019t know.\u201d * Full names have not been used to maintain privacy of those interviewed \u2022 The Red Nose grief and loss support line is available 24/7 for anyone affected by the loss of a pregnancy, stillbirth or death of a baby or child on 1300 308 307 \u2022 In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732) and the national family violence counselling service on 1800 737 732.

Some ask why so much funding and effort is going into bring back species when thousands that are still alive are on the brink of extinction. Euan Ritchie, a professor of wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University, says it is an ambitious project and likely to lead to breakthroughs that could help with conservation. But he says there will be other challenges \u201cif-and-when we bring back thylacine-like animals\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think we will probably get some thylacine-like animal, but they won\u2019t actually be thylacines. The question is: what comes next?\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cHow will they behave in the wild and what effects might they have in the ecosystems? We have no idea how they are going to behave because there are no living thylacines left, and when you can bring back a thylacine-like animal it has got no other thylacine-like animals to learn from.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s at least as big a challenge, if not a bigger challenge, than the genetic challenge. As an ecologist, that\u2019s the big unknown.\u201d</p>",

It meant researchers were able to get information related to the animal\u2019s nose, eyes, tongue and other facial material, giving a picture of what a thylacine could taste and smell, what kind of vision it had and how its brain functioned. Pask says the result is the first annotated extinct animal genome. \u201cIt helps us prove that what we are bringing back is genuinely a thylacine and not some hybrid animal,\u201d he says. The thylacine researchers aim to take stem cells from a living species with similar DNA to a thylacine, the much smaller fat-tailed dunnart, and turn them into the closest approximation of thylacine cells possible using gene editing expertise developed by George Church, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and Colossal\u2019s co-founder. A thylacine-looking thing \u2013 but what comes next? The announcement about the genetic breakthrough came ahead of an event at the SXSW festival in Sydney on Friday, where Lamm and Pask will talk about their work with the actor Luke Hemsworth. The Hemsworths have backed the project. Colossal says it has also developed the first artificial reproductive technology to induce ovulation in marsupials, a step that could lead to captive breeding programs for threatened species, and fertilised single-cell embryos and cultured them to over halfway through pregnancy in an artificial uterus. On when a thylacine might be created, Pask says he expects the first \u201cthylacine-looking thing\u201d could be born within three to five years, but that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t call that a thylacine\u201d. He says the researchers are confident in creating a thylacine\u2019s skull, legs and even stripes, but there are \u201cstill other things we still don\u2019t know how to do\u201d. Other scientists are watching on with varying degrees of caution and scepticism. Some ask why so much funding and effort is going into bring back species when thousands that are still alive are on the brink of extinction. Euan Ritchie, a professor of wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University, says it is an ambitious project and likely to lead to breakthroughs that could help with conservation. But he says there will be other challenges \u201cif-and-when we bring back thylacine-like animals\u201d. \u201cI think we will probably get some thylacine-like animal, but they won\u2019t actually be thylacines. The question is: what comes next?\u201d he says. \u201cHow will they behave in the wild and what effects might they have in the ecosystems? We have no idea how they are going to behave because there are no living thylacines left, and when you can bring back a thylacine-like animal it has got no other thylacine-like animals to learn from. \u201cThat\u2019s at least as big a challenge, if not a bigger challenge, than the genetic challenge. As an ecologist, that\u2019s the big unknown.\u201d",

No contemporary figure particularly comes to mind as equally successful in mega-budget sci-fi movies and down-home country records, but then, Lonergan seems more interested in fame as a state of mind than the particulars of McCrane\u2019s career.

Those moves implied investors had reduced their estimates of how soon the RBA would be cutting the cash rate. \u201cUltimately, this means less pressure on the RBA to bring forward its rate cut timeline,\u201d said Russel Chesler, the head of investments and capital markets at VanEck. \u201cThe hot jobs market is preventing inflation from falling much further, as it is keeping services inflation persistently high. \u201cThe market is pricing in cuts to start by February 2025, but we believe rate cuts will start much later in 2025.\u201d Bjorn Jarvis, the head of labour statistics at the ABS, said employment had risen 3.1% in the past year, outpacing the 2.5% population growth pace. The employment-to-population ratio had lifted by 0.4 percentage points over that time to a record 64.4%. \u201cWhile the number of unemployed people fell slightly to 616,000 in September, overall the number of unemployed has risen by around 90,000 people since September 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite this rise over the last year, there are still around 93,000 fewer unemployed people than there were just before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the unemployment rate was at 5.2%.\u201d",

In response to queries from Guardian Australia, police confirmed several arrests have been made in Melbourne over the past couple of months over allegations that groups of offenders have posed as legitimate users on apps to lure men to meetings. Police alleged in a statement that men were \u201cthen allegedly assaulted, robbed, threatened and subjected to homophobic comments\u201d. Among the recent arrests were that of a 17-year-old boy from Mooroolbark who was charged with attempted armed robbery, intentionally causing injury and criminal damage.

He was on bail and was due to face court again on 19 November. There was no suggestion by police that they consider the different attacks to be linked to one another. Victoria police said the investigations were ongoing and urged any victims to come forward to police. \u201cIf you or someone you know has experienced this behaviour after using a dating app or other social media platform please make a report to police,\u201d a spokesperson said. Users on Grindr in Victoria now see a pop-up alert when opening the app advising them of safety precautions they can take to better protect themselves when meeting someone from the app. Victoria police said Grindr has been cooperative with law enforcement requests, and with messaging users about safety concerns. The Victoria-based sexual health organisation, Thorne Harbour Health, has previously advised users meeting via Grindr but moving to other apps like Snapchat to turn off location sharing on Snapchat, and urged people report any alleged attacks to police. It said people can also minimise risk by meeting in a public place such as a bar, restaurant, or sex-on-premises venue, as well as using features like \u201cFind My\u201d on iPhone to share location with a trusted friend when arranging to meet someone.",

It\u2019s a time for hope, for spirits swelled by the promise and potential that comes with the blank slate of a new season. And that goes not just for the 13 sides taking part in this year\u2019s competition but, as has invariably been the case of late, also the league itself, which has lurched from crisis to crisis in recent years to test the depths of even the most ardent supporter\u2019s endurance. It all begins on Friday, when Central Coast host Melbourne Victory in a rematch of the 2023-24 grand final. In that contest, the Mariners yet again defied their standing to emerge as champions of Australia for the second-straight season with a triumph that put a bow on a historic, treble-winning run of Premiership, Championship and AFC Cup. The 21,379 fans in the stands that day set a new attendance record for Central Coast Stadium, and the mass of humanity that poured onto the field in the aftermath of the game gave the Australian top flight one of the most striking images of its 20 seasons \u2013 a perfect moment of club, community and cause coming together to be sealed in silverware. But on the eve of a new season, it increasingly feels like this is the time that modern football finally extracts its toll on the Mariners.

The Democratic candidate\u2019s first appearance on the conservative network formed part of a direct appeal to right-leaning voters, after she was joined by more than 100 Republicans at a campaign event in Pennsylvania earlier in the day. The interview was combative, with Harris, towards the end, speaking over Baier as she asked him to interview her \u201cgrounded in full assessment of the facts\u201d, while calling him out for playing clips that she said were not relevant to what they were discussing. Here are the key takeaways: Immigration Harris was asked about the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to tackle a surge in illegal immigration at the southern border, and laid the blame on Republicans for failing to pass a border bill. Harris was asked to defend the administration\u2019s early decision to reverse some of Republican rival Donald Trump\u2019s restrictive policies, and to respond to a mother who testified in Congress about the loss of her child at the hands of an illegal immigrant. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for her loss, but let\u2019s talk about what is happening right now,\u201d Harris said. Harris said Trump told Republicans to reject a bipartisan immigration bill because \u201che preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.\u201d The Biden-Harris record Harris was questioned over her recent comment that there was \u201cnot a thing\u201d she would change about the actions of the Biden administration, responding: \u201clet me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency,\u201d but she did not elaborate. Harris was asked when she first noticed that Biden\u2019s \u201cmental faculties appeared diminished\u201d, but the vice-president responded by saying that the president had the judgment and experience to do what needs to be done on behalf of the American people. She added that the people who knew Trump best have said he is unfit to be president ever again, adding: \u201cJoe Biden is not on the ballot and Donald Trump is.\u201d The Middle East Harris singled out Iran when asked which foreign country she considers to be America\u2019s greatest adversary. Baier questioned whether the Biden-Harris administration was \u201cacting like Iran is the number one threat\u201d. The vice-president said she had worked with the heads of the military to do what America must always do, which is to allow Israel to have the resources to defend itself from attack, \u201cincluding from Iran and Iran\u2019s terrorist proxies in the region.

Pushing back against Baier\u2019s line of questioning, Harris at one point said, \u201cI would like if we could have a conversation that is grounded in a full assessment of the facts.\u201d Donald Trump Of Trump, Harris said, \u201cPeople are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader and who spends full-time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances.\u201d She added, \u201cHe\u2019s not stable.\u201d She also sought to focus Fox viewers on Trump\u2019s talk of \u201cthe enemy within\u201d and threats to punish political rivals.

During the event, hosted by Univision, America\u2019s nation\u2019s largest Spanish-language network, Trump defended his call for mass deportation of immigrants who are in the US illegally, even as he nodded to a need for immigrant labour, the Associated Press reports. <br><br>\u201cWe want workers, and we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally, and they have to love our country,\u201d the Republican presidential candidate said during the event, scheduled to air Wednesday evening.

The two-day interview marathon was a noteworthy partial break from that strategy.<br><br>Harris, whom the Trump campaign hammered for not doing interviews after replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, has ramped up the pace this month. The vice-president appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d spoke with radio host Howard Stern and taped a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert, among other appearances. She also sat down with the newsmagazine \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d as is traditional for presidential candidates, while Trump canceled his appearance with the show.<br><br>Harris\u2019 appearance on Fox with anchor Bret Baier on Wednesday seemed designed to show her willingness to face any questioner, especially after Trump bailed on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The risks of that became apparent quickly as Baier challenged her immediately on immigration and often interrupted her afterward.<br><br>In contrast, Trump, in his Chicago interview Tuesday, frequently spoke over Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait and even insulted him as the audience cheered Trump on. Micklethwait challenged Trump\u2019s support for tariffs and his plans to pay for his campaign promises.<br><br>The former president also faced a friendly all-women audience in a Fox News town hall before participating in a town hall on the Spanish-language network Univision, where he faced pointed questions from Latino voters. Like Harris, Trump is trying to broaden his coalition to get the key votes he needs to win the neck-and-neck race.

There have been no credible reports of Haitians eating pets, and officials in Ohio \u2013 including Republicans \u2013 have repeatedly said the story is untrue.<br><br>At a town hall hosted by Univision, an undecided Latino Republican voter from Arizona, a battleground state, asked Trump whether he truly believed that immigrants were eating pets.<br><br>\u201cI was just saying what was reported.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up our live US politics coverage for the day, thanks for following along. Here is our news story on the Kamala Harris interview on Fox news: Kamala Harris said her presidency \u201cwould not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency\u201d in a testy interview with the rightwing Fox News channel on Wednesday night as she criticized Donald Trump over his continuing threats against \u201cthe enemy within\u201d. The 25-minute interview, conducted after Harris held a rally with more than 100 Republican officials in Pennsylvania, was the first time Harris had sat for a conversation with Fox News, which has been a consistent supporter of Trump. Bret Baier, Fox News\u2019s chief political anchor, is seen as a straight news counterbalance to the vitriol of Fox News\u2019s evening shows, but still came with a laundry list of rightwing topics, including immigration, the rights of transgender people and Joe Biden\u2019s performance, as Harris attempted to sell herself to the channel\u2019s older, largely Republican, audience. The event featured pointed questions for Trump, about his wife Melania\u2019s support for abortion rights, noted in her new memoir, and about the 6 January, 2021, Siege of the US Capitol by his supporters who breached the building in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. \u201cYour own vice-president doesn\u2019t want to support you now,\u201d said Ramiro Gonzalez, of Tampa, Florida, a Republican who said he was no longer registered with the party but wanted to give Trump the chance to win him back. Gonzalez was referring to former vice-president Mike Pence, who has disavowed Trump in light of 6 January. Trump\u2019s response: \u201cHundreds of thousands of people come to Washington. They didn\u2019t come because of me. They came because of the election. They thought the election was a rigged election. That\u2019s why they came.\u201d \u201cThat was a day of love from the standpoint of the millions,\u201d Trump told Gonzalez. More now from Trump\u2019s Univision town hall. During the event, hosted by Univision, America\u2019s nation\u2019s largest Spanish-language network, Trump defended his call for mass deportation of immigrants who are in the US illegally, even as he nodded to a need for immigrant labour, the Associated Press reports. \u201cWe want workers, and we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally, and they have to love our country,\u201d the Republican presidential candidate said during the event, scheduled to air Wednesday evening. Trump was answering the question of Jorge Vel\u00e1squez, a farm worker who said most people doing such jobs are undocumented and suggested, if they\u2019re deported, food prices will increase. Trump then returned to his criticism of Harris for being a critical player in the Biden administration\u2019s that presided over an influx of migrants with criminal backgrounds. Here is some analysis from the associated press of Trump and Harris\u2019s recent media appearances: Both candidates have largely avoided traditional interviews during the campaign, preferring to sit before friendly hosts, often in nontraditional media settings. The two-day interview marathon was a noteworthy partial break from that strategy. Harris, whom the Trump campaign hammered for not doing interviews after replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, has ramped up the pace this month. The vice-president appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d spoke with radio host Howard Stern and taped a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert, among other appearances. She also sat down with the newsmagazine \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d as is traditional for presidential candidates, while Trump canceled his appearance with the show. Harris\u2019 appearance on Fox with anchor Bret Baier on Wednesday seemed designed to show her willingness to face any questioner, especially after Trump bailed on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The risks of that became apparent quickly as Baier challenged her immediately on immigration and often interrupted her afterward. In contrast, Trump, in his Chicago interview Tuesday, frequently spoke over Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait and even insulted him as the audience cheered Trump on. Micklethwait challenged Trump\u2019s support for tariffs and his plans to pay for his campaign promises. The former president also faced a friendly all-women audience in a Fox News town hall before participating in a town hall on the Spanish-language network Univision, where he faced pointed questions from Latino voters. Like Harris, Trump is trying to broaden his coalition to get the key votes he needs to win the neck-and-neck race. So, for him as well, every interview counts. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday stood by debunked claims that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets, telling Latino voters during a town hall he was \u201cjust saying what was reported.\u201d Trump in recent weeks has amplified a false claim that has gone viral that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents\u2019 pets or taking wildlife from parks for food. There have been no credible reports of Haitians eating pets, and officials in Ohio \u2013 including Republicans \u2013 have repeatedly said the story is untrue. At a town hall hosted by Univision, an undecided Latino Republican voter from Arizona, a battleground state, asked Trump whether he truly believed that immigrants were eating pets. \u201cI was just saying what was reported. All I do is report,\u201d Trump replied during the event held in Miami. \u201cI was there, I\u2019m going to be there and we\u2019re going to take a look.\u201d Trump added that \u201cnewspapers\u201d had also reported on the claim, without naming any or providing any details. Here is more of that exchange on Iran earlier. Baier asked Harris,\u201cWhich foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?\u201d She said, \u201cIran\u201d. Baier said, \u201cA number of experts thought you would say China\u2026But you said Iran. If that\u2019s the case, what do you say to critics who look at the actions of your administration and say you\u2019re not acting like Iran is the number one threat?\u201d Harris said, \u201cWell, I will tell you most recently, whether it was in April or in October, and then several hours on each occasion that Iran posed a threat to Israel, I was there. Most recently in the Situation Room, in the most recent attack, working with the heads of our military in doing what America must always do to defend and to support Israel in its requirement to defend itself and to give American support to be able to allow Israel to have the resources to defend itself against attack, including from Iran and Iran\u2019s terrorist proxies in the region.\u201d Here is Harris calling out Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier for playing a clip of Trump that was \u201cnot what [Trump] has been saying about the enemy from within\u201d: US vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on Wednesday evening with Fox News host Bret Baier. The interview was combative, with Harris, towards the end, speaking over Baier as asked him to interview her \u201cgrounded in full assessment of the facts\u201d, and called him out for playing clips that she said were not relevant to what they were discussing. Harris was asked about the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to tackle a surge in illegal immigration at the southern border, and laid the blame on Republicans for failing to pass a border bill. Harris was asked to defend the administration\u2019s early decision to reverse some of Republican rival Donald Trump\u2019s restrictive policies, and to respond to a mother who testified in Congress about the loss of her child at the hands of an illegal immigrant. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for her loss, but let\u2019s talk about what is happening right now,\u201d Harris said. Harris said Trump told Republicans to reject a bipartisan immigration bill because \u201che preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.\u201d The interview was part of a direct appeal by Harris on Wednesday to Republican voters in this year\u2019s US presidential election, as she highlighted Republican support for her campaign in a battleground county in Pennsylvania before appearing on conservative-leaning Fox News. Harris was asked in the Fox News interview about her recent comment that there was \u201cnot a thing\u201d she would change about the actions of the Biden administration, responding: \u201clet me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency,\u201d but she did not elaborate. Earlier, in Bucks County, outside of Philadelphia, Harris emphasised Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn his election loss four years ago, when he lost the White House to current President Joe Biden. Harris said Trump\u2019s actions violated the US Constitution and, if given the chance, he will violate it again. \u201cHe refused to accept the will of the people and the results of a free and fair election. He sent a mob, an armed mob, to the United States Capitol, where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials and threatened the life of his own vice president,\u201d Harris said. \u201cNo matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign,\u201d Harris said. Harris was asked \u201cWhich foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?\u201d She said Iran. She has worked with the heads of the military to do what America must always do, which is to allow Israel to have the resources to defend itself from attack, \u201cincluding from Iran and Iran\u2019s territist proxies in the region. And my commitment to that is unwaivering\u201d. The screen showed a graphic listing \u201cIran oil revenue\u201d. Harris talked over Baier, continuing her answer about the Middle East as he tried to press her. He stopped speaking. She said, \u201cI would like that we have a conversation that is grounded in the facts\u201d. \u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cMadam vice-president they\u2019re wrapping me very hard here, I hope you got to say what you wanted about President Trump,\u201d Baier said. Harris said she has a lot more to say about Trump. She invited people to visit her website. Baier interrupted her again, she talked over him, listing the policies that would be found on her website. Former Democrat congressman Harold Ford Junior, on Fox news, says that Harris should be proud of her performance tonight, and that it shows that there are benefits to coming on Fox. \u201cTonight was a sign and a signal to the country about why we need more debates between candidates,\u201d he says. He says Harris \u201cHas to be pleased with how she performed this evening\u201d. Brit Hume, Fox political analyst, says Harris was strong in some ways, but avoided answering other questions, including how she will differ from Biden. He says partisans will be pleased with her performance, they\u2019ll say \u201cYay, Kamala,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if people have doubts about her I don\u2019t think she cleared them up\u201d. Fox news presenters have said, variously, that Harris was strong on some answers, thin on others, and that other answers \u201cwon\u2019t pass the smell test\u201d \u2013 that last comment from Fox news host Dana Perino. She was praised for coming on Fox and allowing herself to \u201cthink on her toes\u201d in a tough interview, rather than the interviews until now, which a Fox host said had been soft. The screen shows a graphic listing \u201cIran oil revenue\u201d. Harris is talking over Baier. He stops. She says, \u201cI would like that we have a conversation that is grounded in the facts\u201d. \u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d he says. \u201cMadam vice-president they\u2019re rapping me very hard here, I hope you got to say what you wanted about President Trump,\u201d he says. Harris says she has a lot more to say about Trump. She invites people to visit her website. Baier interrupts her, she talks over him, listing the policies that would be found on her website. Harris is asked about the Middle East and the threat posed by Iran. She says she has worked with the heads of the military to do what America must always do, which is to allow Israel to have the resources to defend itself from attack, \u201cincluding from Iran and Iran\u2019s territist proxies in the region. And my commitment to that is unwaivering\u201d. Harris is asked \u201cwhen did you first notice that President Biden\u2019s mental faculties appeared diminished\"?\u201d She says Biden had the judgment and experience to do what he needs to do on behalf of the American people. Baier presses her. \u201cYou met with him once a week for three years, you didn\u2019t have any concerns?\u201d Harris said the people who knew Trump (not Biden) best, have said he is unfit to be president ever again. Harris appears unruffled and forceful, but Baier is pressing her. She is pressed again on how she would differ from Biden, and answers again by talking about how she would differ from Trump. Baier asks, if people are sick of Trump, why does half the country support him. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be easy,\u201d Harris says. Baier asks if the people supporting Trump are \u201cmisguided\u201d, or \u201cstupid\u201d. \u201cOh no, I would never say that,\u201d Harris says forcefully. She pivots to Trump talking about the \u201cenemy from within\u201d. Baier plays a clip of Trump saying he has been prosecuted repeatedly. Harris says, that was not the clip of him talking about the enemy from within. \u201cYou and I both know,\u201d she says, that he has talked repeatedly about the enemy within, locking up people who don\u2019t agree with him. Harris\u2019s voice is rising \u2013 you can hear a faint echo as it gets louder in the room in which they\u2019re sitting. They want a president who has a plan for the future, Harris continues. Trump would give tax cuts to billionaires, she says. Baier then plays a clips of Harris being asked how she is different about Biden, and her replying without saying she would do things differently. Harris responds saying that she welcomes ideas, including from Republicans, on what to do differently when she is president. She mentions her plans for first-time home buyers and small business owners. Baier says \u201cwe\u2019ve heard a lot about those plans in recent days\u201d, and then asks Harris, referring to her campaign slogan, how she would turn the page. Harris says that Trump\u2019s rhetoric is based on who you would beat down. She says she would turn the page on rhetoric people \u201care frankly exhausted of, Bret\u201d. Harris says that she is the only person running for president who has prosecuted criminals. Baier turns to an ad from the Trump campaign that plays a clip of Harris supporting gender-affirming surgery for prisoners. Part of the ad is played. Harris says, again, she supports the law. She says that the ad is like throwing stones from a glass house. Baier asks if she would still advocate for using taxpayer dollars to fund gender-affirming surgery. She says again that she will follow the law, and pivots to Trump. He spent $20m on that ad, she says. She says that Trump does not have a plan, and pivots to the economy. \u201cMy plans for the economy will strengthen the economy,\u201d she says. She says experts, including Nobel Laureates, have said so. She says that Trump\u2019s plan would weaken the economy. Bret Baier has asked Kamala Harris repeatedly about immigration. You supported allowing immigrants in the country illegally to apply for drivers licences and to apply for free healthcare, he says. Do you still support those things? The vice-president says it was five years ago that she said those things, and that what she supports is the law. Baier presses her and again, she says she and Tim Walz believe in supporting and enforcing the law. Kamala Harris\u2019s interview with the rightwing Fox News TV channel airs in just a few minutes. In perhaps the most dramatic moment yet in a recent media blitz by the Democratic presidential nominee, her sit-down with chief political anchor, Bret Baier, is due to be broadcast at the top of the hour. It comes as Democrats have increased their presence on Fox News in an outreach to undecided voters and Republicans whom they hope are souring on Donald Trump and ready to switch. The appearance is the latest in a string of media interviews intended to boost her candidacy with less than three weeks to go until the presidential vote. The broadcast comes just a few hours after Harris held a rally in Pennsylvania with more than 100 senior Republicans, including former members of Congress, where she warned that Trump was a threat to US democracy and should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. The man who was arrested on gun possession charges near a Donald Trump rally in California last Saturday has sued the sheriff who oversaw his apprehension, in federal court, according to a new report. The man, Vem Miller of Las Vegas, accuses the sheriff whose deputies detained him, Riverside sheriff Chad Bianco, of knowingly defaming him by falsely saying he was a threat and may have even aspired to kill Trump, the Palm Springs Desert Sun newspaper reported. Miller\u2019s presence spurred significant safety concerns when he was arrested near the rally in Coachella Valley with guns in his truck, although he said he was a major supporter of the former US president and would never harm him. The Desert Sun reported: \u201cThe lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court alleges Bianco spread those lies in several media appearances he made touting the arrest because he wanted to falsely portray himself as a \u2018heroic sheriff\u2019 who had saved Trump from another assassination attempt.\u201d The lawsuit also names the country and 10 sheriff\u2019s deputies, the outlet reports. Kamala Harris said she wants to lead a campaign that is \u201cnot a fight against something, it is a fight for something\u201d. At the bipartisan event, the Democratic nominee presented herself as the face of \u201ca fight for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can achieve together, Republicans, Democrats and independents who want to move past the politics of division and blame\u201d. The classic stump speech language was notable for the sharp contrast with Donald Trump\u2019s raw, divisive style and pessimistic warnings at his rallies of a dystopian America under the Democratic party. At the rally in Bucks county, just outside Philadelphia, were former members of Congress Adam Kinzinger, Denver Riggleman and Barbara Comstock, former Georgia lieutenant governor Geoff Duncan and about 100 other Republicans. There has not been any sign of such bipartisanship with Trump, where groups of former Democratic politicians would endorse and rally for the Republican nominee. People in the crowd are holding up signs saying \u201ccountry over party\u201d and Harris leaned into the bipartisan nature of the event as she gave blistering, unequivocal warnings about the threat she sees from Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president and her opponent in this 5 November election. Before Harris wrapped up the succinct speech, she appealed to people across the party divide who also believe that Donald Trump should not return to the White House as president because he is unfit and a threat to US democracy. \u201cTo those of you who are watching who share that view, no matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign. The coalition we have built has room for everyone who is ready to turn the page on the chaos and instability of Donald Trump,\u201d she said. She promised to reach across the aisle if voted in next month. And she closed by saying voters face the choice between her leadership \u201cthat builds consensus and focuses on making life better for you and \u2026 the choice of someone who I think we can guarantee will sit in the Oval Office plotting retribution, stewing in his own grievances and think only about himself and not you\u201d. Harris closed with a plea for people to stand up together for the rule of law, \u201cour democratic ideals and for the constitution of the United States\u201d. Kamala Harris is really fired up and not pulling her punches on this stage in Pennsylvania this afternoon, alongside Republicans including former members of congress. \u201cI have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution\u2026and I have never wavered from upholding that oath. And this is a profound difference between Donald Trump and me. He who violated the oath\u2026and\u2026if given the chance will violate it again,\u201d Harris said. She then stated to loud cheers: \u201cDonald Trump lost the 2020 election\u201d but then he refused to accept the result. Moments later she said that she believes Trump seeks \u201cunchecked power\u201d and she cited former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, in as much as he \u201cis saying no-one has ever been as dangerous to our country as Donald Trump.\u201d She added: \u201cAnyone who tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has called for, quote, the termination of the Constitution of the United States as Donald Trump has must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again, never again.\u201d Kamala Harris is leaning on US history and her location to emphasize the significance of this bipartisan event under way in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania. She is talking about how George Washington won a huge victory in the revolutionary war with a surprise attack in nearby Trenton after crossing the icy Delaware River with his troops and ultimately went on to help establish the United States with a constitution that upholds \u201cfree and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power\u201d, Harris said. \u201cThese principles have sustained our nation for over two centuries because generations of Americans \u2026 have cherished them, upheld them and defended them,\u201d she said. \u201cNow the baton is in our hands so I\u2019m joined today by more than 100 Republican leaders from across Pennsylvania and across our country who are supporting my candidacy for president of the United States and I\u2019m deeply honored to have their support,\u201d she said. Harris added: \u201cAt stake in this race are the democratic ideals that our founders and generations of Americans before us have fought for.\u201d Kamala Harris just took the stage in Pennsylvania. She\u2019s wearing a dark suit, and appears to be speaking in front of a barn with an American flag inside. Placards reading \u201cCountry over party\u201d can be seen on the side of the stage. First up to speak at Kamala Harris\u2019s event in Pennsylvania was Adam Kinzinger, a former congressman who was one of two Republicans on the bipartisan House committee that investigated the January 6 attack. He described voting for Harris as \u201cthe conservative choice\u201d saying she would uphold the country\u2019s founding principles: I know that Kamala Harris shares my allegiance to the rule of law, to the constitution and to democracy, whatever policies we disagree on pale in comparison to those fundamental matters of principle, of decency, of fidelity to this nation. \u2026 I, like you, believe that those values are worth defending, and if you think those principles are worth defending, I urge you to make the conservative choice vote for our bedrock values and Vote for Kamala Harris. He also had this to say about Donald Trump: As a military guy, I\u2019ve always respected strength in leadership. And Trump is the opposite of that. He\u2019s a whiny, weak, small, tiny man who is scared to death. You know, Donald Trump may be running as a Republican, but the truth is, he does not share those long-held Republican values of supporting democracy, of standing for the rule of law and of faithfulness to the constitution as a Republican. Later this afternoon, Kamala Harris will speak alongside Republican foes of Donald Trump in a Pennsylvania county that will be crucial in deciding which presidential candidate wins the state. At the rally in Bucks county, outside Philadelphia, the Democratic vice-president will be joined by former members of congress Adam Kinzinger, Denver Riggleman and Barbara Comstock, former Georgia lieutenant governor Geoff Duncan and around 100 other Republicans who are expected to warn against sending Trump back to the White House. A senior Harris campaign official said that in her speech, held in a park not far from where George Washington and his troops crossed the Delaware river during the Revolutionary War, the vice-president will accuse Trump of violating his oath of office by attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Her visit comes after in-person early voting began on Tuesday in Bucks county. The speech appears set to be similar to one Joe Biden gave earlier this year in a different part of the Philadelphia suburbs, where he cast Trump as a threat to democracy, hoping to energize a presidential campaign that never quite caught on with voters. Here\u2019s a look back at that: Campaigning in Pennsylvania, JD Vance whipped up the crowd by casting Kamala Harris as an inept interviewer who is in for a shock when she sits down with Fox News interviewer Bret Baier this evening. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you all saw, but, you know, there\u2019s a big, big night for Kamala Harris tonight, because she\u2019s got probably the hardest interview that she\u2019s ever done,\u201d Vance said during a rally in the town of Williamsport. \u201cNow, of course, it is major, major news, because Kamala Harris doesn\u2019t really do interviews at all, and if she does do interviews, they\u2019re a softball interview. Have you seen some of Kamala Harris\u2019s interviews? I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. You lose about 20 IQ points if you watch Kamala Harris give an answer to a question about public policy.\u201d The speech continued with Vance insulting and discrediting Harris, while promoting the policies he and Donald Trump would implement if they win the White House. Harris did indeed spend much of the first weeks of her campaign avoiding the press, but has since been on something of a media blitz. Here\u2019s more on the change in tactics: Jimmy Carter\u2019s son has said that his father, who just turned 100, hoped to live long enough to cast his ballot for Kamala Harris. The Democratic former president may have gotten his wish. The Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports that the Carter Center announced that Carter has cast his presidential election ballot. Though it did not say who he voted for, Carter typically votes Democrat. Here\u2019s more: Republicans have filed a slew of lawsuits that appear to be aimed at seeding doubt about the outcome of the 2024 race in the event of a Donald Trump loss. This comes nearly four years after an aggressive legal effort to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 elections. From 2023 until September of this year, the Republican National Committee (RNC) and local affiliates have filed or are involved in at least 72 cases, according to an analysis by Democracy Docket, a left-leaning voting rights news platform founded by the Democratic lawyer Marc Elias. At the same point during the 2022 midterm election, Republicans had filed 41 lawsuits. There\u2019s nothing unusual about an explosion of litigation over election rules ahead of a presidential election. But experts say what stands out this year isn\u2019t the volume of the cases but their subject matter. Many of the lawsuits are based on a theory that states are not adequately maintaining their voter rolls and that there could be scores of ineligible voters, including non-citizens, on them. They make weak legal claims, election experts say, and instead appear to be more of a public relations effort to motivate Republican voters and echo Trump\u2019s falsehoods about voting. Read the full report here. Here are some more powerful scenes from the memorial service in Washington, DC this afternoon for Ethel Kennedy, the political activist and widow of Bobby Kennedy. By the book: The Pelosis. Paul Pelosi was savagely beaten by an intruder who broke into the family home in San Francisco in 2022 aiming to find Nancy Pelosi and do her harm. She was in Washington at the time. She spoke about the traumatic event in an interview with the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly America podcast this week. Campaign chat? The funeral service for Ethel Kennedy is getting underway at the Cathedral of St Matthew the Apostle in Washington, DC and Joe Biden is going to deliver the eulogy. Former Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and House Speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi are also attending and will deliver remarks. Kennedy died last week at the age of 96 just days after suffering a stroke. She was the widow of Senator Robert F Kennedy and raised their 11 children after he was assassinated in 1968 while running for president, and she remained dedicated to social causes and the family\u2019s legacy for decades thereafter. Here is the Guardian\u2019s obituary. Many Kennedy family members are attending the memorial and there will also be remarks from Martin Luther King III, a descendent of civil rights leader Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Stevie Wonder is due to perform at the service. Biden became the first second US president to be a Catholic and the first since John F Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963. In a Fox News town hall, Donald Trump called himself \u201cthe father of IVF\u201d and said he and others in the Republican party support the fertility treatment \u2013 even though his congressional allies have blocked federal legislation to guarantee its availability. Kamala Harris said her opponent\u2019s comments were \u201cquite bizarre\u201d, while her campaign held a press conference where victims of the migrant family separation policy implemented under Trump\u2019s presidency testified about the harm they endured. Meanwhile, special counsel Jack Smith argued that Trump was responsible for the January 6 attack in a new filing, as he seeks to get his prosecution in the election subversion case back on track. Here\u2019s what else has happened today: Trump also proposed doing away with sanctuary cities by executive order, though an earlier attempt when he was president failed. Michelle Obama will on 29 October headline a rally in Georgia aimed at turning out young voters, while Barack Obama will next week campaign for Harris in Michigan as early voting begins. Harris will this evening appear on the conservative Fox News network for an interview with anchor Bret Baier. Reacting to Donald Trump\u2019s quip earlier today that he was \u201cthe father of IVF\u201d and supported keeping the fertility treatment accessible, Kamala Harris said the remark was quite bizarre and flew in the face of the former president\u2019s record on the issue. \u201cI found it to be quite bizarre\u201d, the vice-president said just before boarding a flight in Detroit bound for Trenton, New Jersey. \u201cHe should take responsibility for the fact that one in three women in America lives in a Trump abortion ban state. What he should take responsibility for is that couples who are praying and hoping and working toward growing a family have \u2026 been so disappointed and harmed by the fact that IVF treatments have now been put at risk.\u201d She added: Let\u2019s not be distracted by his choice of words. The reality is, his actions have been very harmful to women and families in America on this issue. Harris also demurred when asked if she agreed with Barack Obama\u2019s comments towards Black men encouraging them to vote for her: Let me first say that I\u2019m very proud to have the support of former president Barack Obama, and I think that the important point that I will make over and over again is I don\u2019t assume to have the vote of any demographic locked down. The Guardian\u2019s Robert Tait reports that Kamala Harris has said Donald Trump is a \u201cfascist\u201d, an escalation in her rhetoric against him. Here\u2019s more: Kamala Harris has agreed that Donald Trump is a fascist in her most forthright statement yet in casting her presidential opponent as a potential autocrat harboring authoritarian visions should he return to the White House. The US vice-president and Democratic nominee crossed a psychologically important boundary in addressing the issue of fascism in an interview with Charlamagne Tha God, an influential radio host whose audience reaches a predominantly Black audience of 8 million listeners monthly. The talk happened during a campaign stop in Detroit, the centre of a battle between the two candidates for the battleground state of Michigan. Setting out the electoral options in the hourlong phone-in interview, Harris was initially cautious, telling her host that voters in the 5 November election \u201chave two choices \u2026 and it\u2019s two very different visions for our nation\u201d before giving a vague definition of her vision. Jack Smith, the special prosecutor leading the team that charged Donald Trump over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, alleged in a new filing that the former president bears responsibility for the violent January 6 attack on the Capitol, NBC News reports. The statement comes as Smith tries to get his case back on track, after the supreme court earlier this year ruled Trump has immunity for official acts while in office. Here\u2019s more on the argument from Smith\u2019s team: In a filing responding to Trump\u2019s attempt to dismiss the case, Smith\u2019s team said it \u201cis incorrect\u201d for Trump\u2019s team to assert that the superseding indictment returned against Trump in August does not show that Trump bears responsibility for the events of Jan. 6. Trump, Smith\u2019s team said, \u201cwillfully caused others\u201d to obstruct the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory by repeating his false claims of election fraud and giving \u201cfalse hope\u201d to his supporters who believed that former Vice President Mike Pence might overturn the election, and by \u201cpressuring\u201d Pence and legislators to accept fraudulent certificates as part of the fake electors scheme. \u201cThose allegations link the defendant\u2019s actions on January 6 directly to his efforts to corruptly obstruct the certification proceeding,\u201d Smith\u2019s team wrote. \u201cContrary to the defendant\u2019s claim... that he bears no factual or legal responsibility for the \u2018events on January 6,\u2019 the superseding indictment plainly alleges that the defendant willfully caused his supporters to obstruct and attempt to obstruct the proceeding by summoning them to Washington, D.C., and then directing them to march to the Capitol to pressure the Vice President and legislators to reject the legitimate certificates and instead rely on the fraudulent electoral certificates,\u201d Smith\u2019s team wrote. Trump\u2019s lawyers previously argued the indictment \u201cstretches generally applicable statutes beyond their breaking point based on false claims that President Trump is somehow responsible for events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021\u201d and sought to \u201cassign blame for events President Trump did not control and took action to protect against.\u201d Asked about his stance on IVF care, Donald Trump claimed at the Fox News town hall that he and the rest of the Republican party were in favor of the care that allows people struggling with fertility issues to have children, going so far as to call himself \u201cthe father of IVF\u201d. The question came after the Alabama supreme court issued a ruling earlier this year that briefly cut off access to the treatment in the deep-red state, raising fears that Republican politicians opposed to the treatment would press the party to ban it nationwide, or in other states. After describing himself to the questioner as \u201cthe father of IVF\u201d Trump said at the town hall that after the court ruling, he got a call from Katie Britt, \u201ca fantastically attractive person\u201d who is also a Republican senator from Alabama. She told him about the decision\u2019s implications, and he said he then came out in favor of continued access to IVF. Here\u2019s how he put it: We really are the party for IVF. We want fertilization, and it\u2019s all the way, and the Democrats tried to attack us on it, and we\u2019re out there on IVF even more than them, so, we\u2019re totally in favor of it. Nonetheless, Republicans in the US Senate have repeatedly blocked passage of legislation that would guarantee access to the procedure nationwide: Donald Trump said at his Fox News town hall that if he was elected, he would sign an executive order to ban sanctuary cities under a two-century old law. \u201cWe are going to end all sanctuary cities immediately \u2026 I can do it with an executive order. I have to do it with an executive order. You can do it with \u2026 the Aliens Act of 1798, we can do things in terms of moving people out. We can move them out of the sanctuary cities,\u201d Trump said. After first taking office in 2017, Trump signed an executive order cutting cities who do not cooperate with immigration authorities off from federal funding, but it was later struck down by the courts. He has centered his most recent campaign on imposing hardline immigration policies, and plans to use the Aliens Act of 1798 to do so: Fox News is now airing its pre-recorded town hall with Donald Trump and a group of female voters in Georgia. It\u2019s a friendly crowd, which greeted Trump with applause and cheers when he stepped onstage. Thus far, the former president has spent most of his time talking about how much better everything would be if he was in charge. Moderator Harris Faulkner nonetheless made a modest effort to get him to back up some of his assertions, particularly when it comes to inflation. Trump has said prices will go down if he is elected, but Faulkner pointed out that prices that rise due to inflation typically do not go down, but rather grow at a slower rate. Trump replied by changing the subject, before acknowledging that prices probably will not decrease: So I feel so badly about what\u2019s happened, because none of this would have happened just to start. There wouldn\u2019t have been a war in Ukraine and Russia. There wouldn\u2019t have been an October 7 in Israel. There wouldn\u2019t have been this horrible, most embarrassing day in the history of our country, with Afghanistan, where we lost 13 soldiers, but they never talk about the soldiers that are so badly wounded. I mean, with legs and arms and face Obliteration, all these things, and there wouldn\u2019t have been any inflation. And it\u2019s so sad to say, we have to get prices down, because the damage is done. Speaking of Donald Trump, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi shared her (outraged) thoughts on the former president, among other topics, in an interview with the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Freedland yesterday. It\u2019s on the Politics Weekly American podcast, and you can listen to it here: Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar was also at the press conference. The Democrat is a national co-chair of the Harris- represents the area around the border city of El Paso, and had this to say about Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies: El Paso, Texas was where Donald Trump began his horrific policy of separating families, separating children, children as young as the kids just heard from, from their parents. We are having this press conference because we want Americans to remember what Donald Trump did, not just at the border, but what he did to our country. We know that our immigration system is broken, and I can tell you, as a resident of the border, no one knows more that our immigration system is broken than those of us who live on the US-Mexico border and who\u2019ve been working for immigration reform for decades. But what Donald Trump presents are not solutions. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t bring policy ideas to the table. Donald Trump did not fix a broken system. In fact, what Donald Trump did was take a broken system and he obliterated it. He uses cruelty as American public policy. Here\u2019s video of the children who were separated from their parents while entering the United States speaking at a Harris campaign event about their experiences: A little bit more detail on Billy who spoke earlier. A reporter asked him how hold he was, and where he came from. He replied that he is 16, and came from Guatemala. Billy was followed by a girl who gave her name as Janice Adriana and shared her own story of being detained when trying to enter the United States. \u201cThey told us that they were going to separate me and my mom, and that\u2019s when everything bad started to happen. I started crying, me and Mama started crying because we thought we were never going to see each other again\u201d Adriana said. She continued: Then they took her away from me, and after that, I had to stay in this foster care for a week, and I asked them plenty of times when I was gonna see my mom again, and they told me I was gonna see her soon, but it never happened. After that, they took me to my dad for and I stayed here with him for about two months, and I was feeling a little bit better because I was out of the foster care, and at least I was with my dad, but then they deported him to Honduras, and I had nobody with me, only my aunt, which I had to stay with her for three years. I couldn\u2019t see my mom for those whole three years, which was really sad for me, because I thought I wasn\u2019t going to see her more than that. Adriana closed with: \u201cKamala Harris helped me and my parents get together again, and now me and my parents are happily living together, and I don\u2019t want Donald Trump to be president again, because I don\u2019t want other kids to go through what I did.\u201d Billy was eventually reunited with his father, but said the damage from their forced separation lingers: I went and ran to my dad, I hugged him, and I told him I did not want this to happen ever again. And he promised me that he would not ever leave me again. And after that, we still fear. I go to therapists, but I still have the fear of Trump being reelected, and that same thing happening to me or other kids ever again. Kamala Harris helped us be together again, and she helped us be a family again. And I don\u2019t want this to happen to any more kids. The Harris campaign organized the event ahead of a town hall Trump will participate this evening on Univision News, as part of his effort to woo Latino voters. Survivors of Donald Trump\u2019s family separation policy are telling their stories at an event convened by Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign to condemn the former president\u2019s hardline immigration policies. A young man who identified himself as Billy told a press conference in Doral, Florida, that he was detained after arriving in the United States and told he would see his father again soon. \u201cAfter that day, I never saw him again for 40 days,\u201d Billy said, describing how he was instead flown to New York and put with a foster family. \u201cThey told me that I wasn\u2019t going to get to see my dad again and that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to see my family again. As a nine-year-old, you can probably imagine how that felt, great sadness in front of me and very traumatic, something that I still hold to this day. The emptiness that I felt when I when they told me that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to see my family again, was something out of this world, and something that no kids should go through.\u201d Joe Biden is headed to Arizona next week \u2013 but the White House says it\u2019s for an official event (ie not a campaign event). It\u2019s not clear yet what brings the president to the battleground state that he won by just over 10,000 votes in 2020, becoming the first Democratic nominee to win Arizona since Bill Clinton. Recent polling shows Kamala Harris trailing Donald Trump in the state, even as the Democratic candidate for Senate, Ruben Gallego, leads his Republican opponent, Trump ally Kari Lake. Harris doesn\u2019t need to win Arizona, since she has other paths to 270. But it is perhaps a worrying sign about her standing among Hispanic voters, who make up about a third of the state\u2019s electorate. However, Democrats cannot hold on to the Senate without keeping the seat. Michelle Obama will later this month hold a rally in Atlanta aimed at encouraging young voters to get to the polls, her nonpartisan organization When We All Vote announced. The 29 October event will feature Atlanta-area college and high school students and is aimed at encouraging first-time voters to cast ballots in Georgia, which Joe Biden won in 2020 by a narrow 12,000 votes. \u201cThe election doesn\u2019t start on Election Day \u2014 it ends on Election Day. Thanks to our Georgia partners and volunteers who continue to make sure their communities are ready to vote, Georgia voters are fired up and ready to use their voices,\u201d said When We All Vote\u2019s executive director Beth Lynk in a statement. Obama launched When We All Vote in 2018 with the aim of getting new voters out to the polls. The Atlanta rally will be her first public event since her speech to the Democratic national convention, where she artfully decried Donald Trump: It\u2019s a big day for Fox News, where Kamala Harris will at 6pm sit for an interview with anchor Bret Baier, hours after Donald Trump\u2019s pre-recorded town hall airs. It will be something of a journey into hostile territory for the vice-president, since Fox\u2019s coverage and viewership tends to skew conservative. We don\u2019t know yet what they\u2019ll talk about, but Baier yesterday said the interview would air without commercial breaks. Harris will appear on Fox News as she continues a string of media interviews intended to boost her candidacy with less than three weeks to go until the presidential vote. Here\u2019s more on that: At 11am today, Fox News will broadcast a pre-recorded town hall with Donald Trump and a group of women in swing state Georgia. Expect a friendly encounter \u2013 Fox News is a conservative network, and a brief clip of the event broadcast yesterday shows Trump taking questions on immigration, an issue that is a mainstay of his speeches. Nonetheless, the event does serve a purpose for the former president: polls have shown that his standing is weak among some groups of women, and the event appears to be geared towards turning that around, specifically in a state that could decide the election. \u201cWomen constitute the largest group of registered and active voters in the United States, so it is paramount that female voters understand where the presidential candidates stand on the issues that matter to them most,\u201d Fox News presenter Harris Faulkner said in announcing the event. State governments across the US are taking steps to eliminate protections for minors as rates of child labor violations, injuries and chronic school absenteeism rise, according to a report released today. The report by Governing For Impact, the Economic Policy Institute, and Child Labor Coalition proposes actions the Biden-Harris administration can take in response to a recent surge in child labor violations around the country and a trend of some states passing legislation that rollbacks state-level child labor protections. Its authors also warn that moves to weaken child protections will likely escalate under a second Trump presidency. Barack Obama will next week hit the campaign trail on behalf of Kamala Harris on Tuesday, when early voting begins in Michigan, the vice-president\u2019s campaign announced. The former president will rally voters in Detroit, Harris\u2019s campaign said, without giving further details. Obama made his first campaign appearance for Harris last week in Pennsylvania, where he encouraged Black men to cast ballots for the vice-president: Donald Trump\u2019s pro-Israel stance has alienated the far right, which is ramping up antisemitic attacks, Ben Makuch writes. One campaign issue where the Maga world and the extremists of Telegram and other fringe social media sites have diverged, is the former president\u2019s support for Israel in its several military operations across the Middle East. The ideologies of the far right and Donald Trump have for the most part been in agreement since he took the reins of the Republican ticket at the RNC convention in July. While supporters waved ultranationalist \u201cMASS DEPORTATION NOW!\u201d signs, Trump gave a speech mixed with hate, in a nomination that was roundly approved across the rightwing political sphere. That sense of unity, however, has begun to crack under the weight of antisemitic attacks aimed at Trump for commemorating the anniversary of the 7 October attacks \u2026 US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Washington was looking into reports that North Korea was sending troops to fight for Russia against Ukraine. Western countries have long accused North Korea of sending weapons to help Russia fight in Ukraine. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the North was also sending personnel, becoming effectively a participant in the war. Asked about that issue, Campbell said there were signs of the North\u2019s enhanced material support for Russia \u201cwhich is being felt on the battlefield\u201d, but that Washington was still evaluating the reports. Three officials from the US, South Korea and Japan earlier announced a new 11-nation team to monitor the enforcement of sanctions against the North after Russia and China thwarted a UN mechanism. Tension has been growing on the Korean Peninsula recently, as the North accused the South of launching drones into its territory. Pyongyang also blew up inter-Korean roads and rail lines. Products made by US computer chip company Intel sold in China should be subject to a security review, the Cybersecurity Association of China (CSAC) said, Reuters reports. CSAC alleges the US chipmaker has \u201cconstantly harmed\u201d the country\u2019s national security and interests. While CSAC is an industry group rather than a government body, it has close ties to the Chinese state and the raft of accusations against Intel, published in a long post on its official WeChat account, could trigger a security review from China\u2019s cyberspace regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). Last year, CAC barred domestic operators of key infrastructure from buying products made by US memory chipmaker Micron Technology after deeming the company\u2019s products had failed its network security review. A similar security review on Intel products could negatively impact the company\u2019s revenues, over a quarter of which came from China last year. The allegations come at a time when China is dealing with a US-led effort to restrict its access to crucial chipmaking equipment and components, in what Washington calls a bid to halt the modernisation of China\u2019s military. The Biden administration has warned Israel that it faces possible punishment, including the potential stopping of US weapons transfers, if it does not take immediate action to let more humanitarian aid into Gaza. A letter written jointly by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, and Lloyd Austin, the defence secretary, exhorts Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government to ease humanitarian suffering in the territory by lifting restrictions on the entry of assistance within 30 days or face unspecified policy \u201cimplications\u201d. The four-page missive, dated 13 October, was sent to Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defence minister, and Ron Dermer, the strategic affairs minister, and came to light after being posted on social media by Barak Ravid, an Israeli journalist who works for Axios, after apparently being leaked. Kamala Harris will aim to appeal to Republican voters as she plans to visit a battleground county in Pennsylvania joined by Republican supporters and to appear on conservative-leaning Fox News later today, Reuters reports. In Bucks County, outside of Philadelphia, Harris is expected to emphasise Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn his election loss four years ago. Over 100 Republicans will join Harris in Bucks County, including Adam Kinzinger, a former Congressman and member of the committee that investigated the 6 January attack on the Capitol by supporters of the then-president. Trump will participate in a town hall hosted by Univision. And Fox News will air a separate Trump town hall with an all-women audience. An Associated Press survey has found that more than 63,000 Georgia voters have had their eligibility to vote challenged since 1 July. The news agency says that this represents a big surge from 2023 and the first half of 2024, when it found that about 18,000 voters were challenged. Only about 1% of those challenged in recent months have been removed from the voting rolls or placed into challenged status, mostly in one county. Fewer than 800 voters since 1 July \u2013 mostly in the suburban Atlanta Republican stronghold of Forsyth County \u2013 have been removed from the rolls or placed in challenged status. Voters in challenged status can cast ballots if they prove their residence. Most of the targeted voters appear to have moved away from their listed addresses, and activists argue letting them stay registered invites fraud. Challengers have been aided by tools which rely on change-of-address lists and other documents to help identify people who could be wrongly registered to vote. The push to challenge voters in Georgia is part of a national effort coordinated by Donald Trump\u2019s allies to remove people they view as suspect from the voting rolls. The effort to remove voters has drawn scrutiny from the US Justice Department, which has issued guidance that aims to limit challenges. Donald Trump has said that if he does not win the election, he may cry fraud and not accept the results \u2013 just as he did four years ago when he lost to Joe Biden. Reuters looks at what might happen if Trump rejects the election result again \u2026 Republicans and Democrats expect that vote counting could drag on for several days after 5 November. If it appears Trump is losing, the delay will give him an opportunity to attempt to undermine confidence in election officials, while also possibly encouraging his supporters to protest. He has already threatened to jail election workers and other public officials for \u201cunscrupulous behaviour,\u201d although he would need to win the election first. As they did in 2020, Trump\u2019s allies in key states \u2013 local election officials, state lawmakers and perhaps judges \u2013 could seek to delay certification, the confirmation of a state\u2019s official tally, through claims of fraud. Those efforts did not succeed last time, and election law experts say the laws in those states are clear that local officials lack the power to throw out ballots or derail the process. After the 2020 election, Congress passed a reform law that makes it more difficult for candidate to mount the kind of challenge Trump attempted last time round. Any effort by Trump to suggest the election was rigged could potentially lead to civil unrest, as it did on 6 January, 2021. Experts who monitor militant right-wing groups, such as Peter Montgomery of the People For the American Way, a liberal think tank, say they are less concerned about a violent response from these groups than they are about threats against election workers counting votes. There also could be violent demonstrations in the capitals of battleground states, Montgomery said. Hundreds of people who were involved in the 6 January attack on the Capitol have been convicted and jailed for their actions, a powerful deterrent to others who may be considering taking similar actions. Two US officials who resigned last year in protest over president Joe Biden\u2019s policy on the Gaza war have launched a lobbying organisation and a political action committee (PAC) to advocate for a revamp of Washington\u2019s stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict, Reuters reports. Josh Paul, a former State Department official and Tariq Habash, who used to work as a policy advisor at the Department of Education, said the American public is no longer in favour of unconditionally sending US weapons to Israel, but that elected officials have lagged behind. Their PAC, called \u201cA New Policy\u201d, would support candidates whose position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict align with US policies on human rights and equality and would ensure US arms transfers to all countries in the Middle East, including Israel, comply with both US and international law. Washington\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza and more recently in Lebanon has emerged as a key reason for why Muslim and Arab voters, who resoundingly had backed Biden in 2020, may withhold their votes from Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the upcoming election. \u201cAmerican voters are clear: they do not want to be complicit in this humanitarian catastrophe and a majority want an end to the transfer of lethal weapons that are used to kill Palestinian civilians,\u201d Habbash said. A Georgia judge has temporarily halted a new rule requiring poll workers to hand count ballots in the 5 November election, in a defeat for Donald Trump, whose Republican allies pushed for the change after he lost the battleground state in 2020, Reuters reports. The hand-count rule was passed last month by a pro-Trump conservative majority of Georgia\u2019s election board, who said they were attempting to make the Nov. 5 election more secure and transparent. Democrats had said the change would sow chaos and delay results. Georgia, where early voting began in record numbers yesterday, is one of seven states likely to determine the presidential contest next month. In 2020, Trump made false claims of widespread voting fraud in the state. Judge Robert McBurney said in his decision that it was appropriate to pause the vote counting rule because it introduced fresh uncertainty into the process just weeks before election day. \u201cAnything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public,\u201d according to a copy of the decision posted by Democracy Docket, a website founded by Democratic lawyer Marc Elias that tracks election cases. Elon Musk gave around $75 million to his pro-Donald Trump spending group in the span of three months, federal disclosures showed, underscoring how the billionaire has become crucial to the Republican candidate\u2019s efforts to win the presidential election, Reuters reports. America PAC, which is focused on turning out voters in closely contested states that could decide the election, spent around $72 million of that in the July-September period, according to disclosures filed to the Federal Election Commission. That is more than any other pro-Trump super PAC focused on turning out voters. The Trump campaign is broadly reliant on outside groups for canvassing voters, meaning the super PAC founded by Musk \u2013 the world\u2019s richest man \u2013 plays an outsized role in the razor-thin election between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. We\u2019re now less than three weeks away from the US election on 5 November. Earlier it was revealed Elon Musk gave around $75m to his pro-Donald Trump spending group in the span of three months, federal disclosures show, underscoring how the billionaire has become one of the largest Republican donors. Here\u2019s a rundown of what\u2019s been happening and what to expect on the campaign trail today: The first day of early voting in the battleground state of Georgia saw a record turnout, with 328,000 people casting a vote in person or by mail. This more than doubled the previous record of 136,000 set in 2020. Trump will launch a bus tour of north Carolina later today. The tour will travel across the state for three days before ending at the Wayne County Republican Party HQ on Friday. Early in-person voting begins tomorrow in the battleground state. Kamala Harris will return to the battleground state of Pennsylvania for another campaign event later today, after she visited Erie on Monday. She will then head to Wisconsin to visit Milwaukee, La Crosse and Green Bay on Thursday. Trump refused to say if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the 5 November election, in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. He claimed there had been a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election, despite his supporters\u2019 violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January. He also doubled down on his promise to levy tariffs on all imports in a bid to boost American manufacturing. Economists say this policy would probably mean higher prices for consumers and anger US allies. Yesterday Harris defended her record as a prosecutor, pledged to decriminalise marijuana and push for police reform. She was aiming to shore up support among black men in an interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God. The Harris Victory Fund, the Democratic candidate\u2019s \u2018big-dollar fundraising committee\u2019, raised $633m in the three months from 1 July to 30 September. This was over a third higher than the amount raised by Biden in the same period in 2020, the New York Times reported. President Joe Biden said Harris would \u201ccut her own path\u201d once she wins the 2024 election, as he hit the campaign trail to help win over sceptical voters three weeks before Election Day. \u201cKamala will take the country in her own direction, and that\u2019s one of the most important differences in this election,\u201d he said. \u201cKamala\u2019s perspective on our problems will be fresh and new. Donald Trump\u2019s perspective old and failed and quite frankly, thoroughly totally dishonest.\u201d",
