It feels as though I am living in a country that is not only hostile to my pain but, by extension, also to me. And how much am I part of the state? I work and pay taxes and raise my children. I am complicit in my pain. I am complicit in the destruction of my home. And I am expected to feel protected by an Australia that hardly seems to care about the names and lives of the deaths of my people and my children and my city and my country. And explain to my Australian children why that is so. That they are seen. That they are valued. That their lives matter. That they are not only numbers. That we will visit Baalbek\u2019s temples again. That we will get to spend a weekend with the sea turtles at Orange House. That those deaths were ours. That all the deaths are all of ours. \u2022 Sherine Al Shallah is a University of New South Wales doctoral researcher, Kaldor Centre affiliate, Australian Human Rights Institute associate and Justice Inclusion Access project coordinator with over 20 years\u2019 experience in senior policy roles",

      "bodyText": "Millions of patients in England with suspected broken bones could have their X-rays checked with a \u00a31 artificial intelligence scan to help NHS doctors avoid missing fractures. Overlooked broken bones are among the most common mistakes made in A&amp;E units and urgent care centres, with as many as 10% of fracture cases either not spotted at all by medical professionals or diagnosed late. Missing a fracture during an initial assessment can lead to further injury or harm to the patient, worsening their condition and making it harder for hospitals to treat quickly. The NHS has now been given the green light by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) to use AI as a way of improving fracture detection when examining X-rays. Clinical evidence suggests that using AI may improve detection in scans, compared with a medical professional reviewing on their own, \u201cwithout increasing the risk of incorrect diagnoses\u201d, Nice said. Using AI could reduce the number of fractures missed at initial presentation, prevent further injury or harm to people during the time between the first assessment and a decision on further treatment, and \u201cmay help reduce variation in care across the country\u201d, it added. The move could also reduce the need for follow-up checks and appointments amid the NHS workforce crisis. Mark Chapman, the director of HealthTech at Nice, said: \u201cEvery day across the NHS, thousands of images are interpreted by expert radiologists and radiographers, but there is a high vacancy rate within these departments across the country and more support is needed to manage their workload. \u201cThese AI technologies are safe to use and could spot fractures which humans might miss given the pressure and demands these professional groups work under.\u201d In addition to a trained healthcare professional reviewing the X-ray, the NHS can use four AI platforms under draft guidance published by Nice. Those recommended are TechCare Alert, which can be used on patients of any age; Rayvolve, for adults only; and BoneView and RBfracture, for adults and children aged two and up. Chapman said: \u201cUsing AI technology to help highly skilled professionals in urgent care centres to identify which of their patients has a fracture could potentially speed up diagnosis and reduce follow-up appointments needed because of a fracture missed during an initial assessment.\u201d Patients with suspected fractures are typically assessed by a nurse or doctor, who may request an X-ray to be carried out by a radiographer. Nice recommends that these X-rays should be reviewed by a radiologist, radiographer or other trained professional, who should provide a detailed report before a patient is discharged. Nevertheless, Nice said this was not always possible in practice, with reporting delays lasting days or weeks. During modelling, the cost for each AI scan was estimated at \u00a31.

      "body": "<p>Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has revealed that his ancestor owned enslaved people on a plantation in Jamaica and was compensated by the British government when slavery was abolished.</p> <p>Welby disclosed his ancestral links in a personal statement that reiterated his commitment to addressing the enduring and damaging legacies of transatlantic slavery.</p> <p>The archbishop, who is the leader of the global Anglican church, said he discovered recently that his late biological father, Sir Anthony Montague Browne, a private secretary to Winston Churchill, \u201chad an ancestral connection to the enslavement of people in Jamaica and Tobago\u201d.</p> <p>In 2016, Welby learned that he had been conceived as the result of a brief fling between his mother and Browne, and that Gavin Welby, whom she married shortly afterwards, was not his biological father. Justin Welby had no relationship with Browne, who died in 2013.</p> <p>According to the archbishop\u2019s statement, Browne was the great great grandson of Sir James Fergusson, the fourth Baronet of Kilkerran and the owner of enslaved people at the Rozelle plantation in St Thomas.</p> <p>Fergusson, who died in 1838, <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2022/the-collection-of-slavery-compensation-1835-43\">received part of a \u00a320m compensation package</a> from the British government for the loss of \u201cproperty\u201d after slavery was abolished.</p> <p>The Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery says the Rozelle plantation had <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/12053\">about 200 enslaved people working on it</a> at its height, and the Fergusson family shared compensation of \u00a33,591 in 1836 \u2013 estimated at more than \u00a33m today.</p> <p>Welby did not receive any money from Browne while he was alive or from his estate after he died.</p> <p>The archbishop has been at the forefront of the public acknowledgement by the Church of England (C of E) of its historical benefit from transatlantic slavery.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/10/church-of-england-100m-fund-past-wrongs-slave-trade-links\">report published last year</a>, the church traced the origins of its \u00a39bn endowment fund partly to Queen Anne\u2019s Bounty, a financial scheme established in 1704 based on transatlantic chattel slavery.</p> <p>At the time, Welby said: \u201cI am deeply sorry for these links. It is now time to take action to address our shameful past.\u201d</p> <p>The church has pledged \u00a3100m to address the legacy of enslavement. It said later it aimed to grow this to \u00a31bn with contributions from co-investors after a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrjv9r1jyko\">report from an oversight group</a>, chaired by Bishop Rosemarie Mallett, said the original amount pledged was not enough.</p> <p>In Tuesday\u2019s statement, the archbishop reiterated the C of E\u2019s commitment to a \u201cthorough and accurate research programme, in the knowledge that archives have far more to tell us about what has come before us \u2013 often in a very personal way\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhile I sadly only discovered my relationship to Sir Anthony in 2016, three years after his death, I did have the delight of meeting my half-sister and her son.\u201d</p> <p>The truth about his biological father came to light after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/09/justin-welby-archbishop-canterbury-discovers-father-churchill-private-secretary\">Welby took a DNA test</a>, which showed a 99.98% probability that he was Browne\u2019s son. His mother, Jane, who died last year, said the revelation had \u201ccome as an almost unbelievable shock\u201d.</p> <p>Sir Adam Fergusson, the 10th baronet, said on behalf of the Fergusson family that its \u201cinvolvement in slavery is a horrible part of its past\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has revealed that his ancestor owned enslaved people on a plantation in Jamaica and was compensated by the British government when slavery was abolished. Welby disclosed his ancestral links in a personal statement that reiterated his commitment to addressing the enduring and damaging legacies of transatlantic slavery. The archbishop, who is the leader of the global Anglican church, said he discovered recently that his late biological father, Sir Anthony Montague Browne, a private secretary to Winston Churchill, \u201chad an ancestral connection to the enslavement of people in Jamaica and Tobago\u201d. In 2016, Welby learned that he had been conceived as the result of a brief fling between his mother and Browne, and that Gavin Welby, whom she married shortly afterwards, was not his biological father. Justin Welby had no relationship with Browne, who died in 2013. According to the archbishop\u2019s statement, Browne was the great great grandson of Sir James Fergusson, the fourth Baronet of Kilkerran and the owner of enslaved people at the Rozelle plantation in St Thomas. Fergusson, who died in 1838, received part of a \u00a320m compensation package from the British government for the loss of \u201cproperty\u201d after slavery was abolished. The Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery says the Rozelle plantation had about 200 enslaved people working on it at its height, and the Fergusson family shared compensation of \u00a33,591 in 1836 \u2013 estimated at more than \u00a33m today. Welby did not receive any money from Browne while he was alive or from his estate after he died. The archbishop has been at the forefront of the public acknowledgement by the Church of England (C of E) of its historical benefit from transatlantic slavery. In a report published last year, the church traced the origins of its \u00a39bn endowment fund partly to Queen Anne\u2019s Bounty, a financial scheme established in 1704 based on transatlantic chattel slavery. At the time, Welby said: \u201cI am deeply sorry for these links. It is now time to take action to address our shameful past.\u201d The church has pledged \u00a3100m to address the legacy of enslavement. It said later it aimed to grow this to \u00a31bn with contributions from co-investors after a report from an oversight group, chaired by Bishop Rosemarie Mallett, said the original amount pledged was not enough. In Tuesday\u2019s statement, the archbishop reiterated the C of E\u2019s commitment to a \u201cthorough and accurate research programme, in the knowledge that archives have far more to tell us about what has come before us \u2013 often in a very personal way\u201d. He said: \u201cWhile I sadly only discovered my relationship to Sir Anthony in 2016, three years after his death, I did have the delight of meeting my half-sister and her son.\u201d The truth about his biological father came to light after Welby took a DNA test, which showed a 99.98% probability that he was Browne\u2019s son. His mother, Jane, who died last year, said the revelation had \u201ccome as an almost unbelievable shock\u201d. Sir Adam Fergusson, the 10th baronet, said on behalf of the Fergusson family that its \u201cinvolvement in slavery is a horrible part of its past\u201d. He said: \u201cThe archbishop\u2019s connection with the family is a surprise to us all. It is sobering that, five or six generations on, very large numbers of us will have links, known and unknown, to this terrible phase of our history.\u201d Alex Renton, another descendant of Fergusson and the author of Blood Legacy \u2013 Reckoning with a Family\u2019s Story of Slavery, said he and other relatives had made personal donations towards repair initiatives in Britain and the Caribbean since becoming aware of the family\u2019s history. Renton has also helped set up the Heirs of Slavery group, which works \u201cto encourage other families enriched by slavery wealth to acknowledge their history, apologise and support campaigns for reparations in Europe and the Caribbean\u201d. In his statement, Welby referred to his trip to Jamaica in July, when he received an honorary degree from the University of the West Indies and apologised to Jamaicans for the church\u2019s role in the enslavement of their ancestors. He was quoted in the Jamaica Observer saying: \u201cI cannot speak for the government of the United Kingdom but I can speak from my own heart and represent what we say now in England. We are deeply, deeply, deeply sorry. We sinned against your ancestors. I would give anything that that can be reversed, but it cannot.\u201d The news about Welby\u2019s ancestor comes amid growing pressure on Keir Starmer to address reparatory justice when he travels to Samoa this week to attend the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. There has been speculation about whether or not reparations will be on the agenda, with the UK government ruling out issuing an apology at the summit.",

      "bodyText": "One in four English councils could go bankrupt unless they are bailed out by the government in the next two years, a survey has revealed. Councils are warning of a \u201cworsening crisis\u201d that could result in cuts to vital public services amid a funding gap of more than \u00a32bn next year, according to the survey of chief executives conducted by the Local Government Association. Louise Gittins, the LGA chair, said local governments were facing an \u201cextraordinary funding emergency\u201d in which more were being pushed into a precarious funding position. \u201cThis is not just about numbers on a spreadsheet,\u201d she said. \u201cBudget cuts needed to plug growing funding gaps will affect the most vulnerable members of society and the services our communities rely on every day.\u201d To protect local services, the LGA is calling on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to stabilise council finances in the autumn budget, including a multi-year finance settlement and a review into changing the local government funding system. In February an unprecedented total of 19 councils were given government bailout agreements, known as exceptional financial support (EFS), to meet their legal duty to balance their books. This granted councils unusual permission to borrow money and sell land and buildings, which the LGA warned provided \u201ctemporary financial relief\u201d but could overload \u201calready struggling councils with further debt and costs in the future\u201d. The LGA\u2019s survey shows that about one in 10 councils have already discussed receiving emergency support with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, with 25% likely to apply in 2025-26 and 2026-27, a figure that rises to 44% for councils with social care responsibilities. The survey shows that the biggest pressures come from social care, followed by special educational needs and disability (Send) services, school transport and homelessness. The LGA says this is due to inflation and wage pressures, alongside rising demand for services. The survey also shows that councils are considering reducing hours of operation and services, cutting frontline staff numbers, extending waiting times and increasing fees. Two-thirds of councils said parks, green spaces and sports would be affected (62%), while almost eight in 10 have identified services and support for disabled adults and older people for cuts. Two-thirds also said services and support for children, young people and families would be affected (63%). Separately, the County Councils Network (CCN) said 26 of England\u2019s largest councils could declare bankruptcy by 2027 if their multibillion Send deficits were placed on their budgets. A special accounting measure known as a \u201cstatutory override\u201d, which allows councils to keep Send debts off their balance sheets, is scheduled to expire in March 2026. This would triple their funding shortfall overnight and increase the risk of council bankruptcy declarations by 60%, the CCN calculated. Rising demand and costs have resulted in England\u2019s 38 county and largest unitary authorities in England amassing Send deficits of \u00a32bn this year, a figure projected to rise to \u00a32.7bn in 2025-26. Research by CCN and the LGA earlier this year identified a \u00a35bn debt crisis resulting from out-of-control spending on special educational needs after a surge in the number of eligible children and reliance on special school placements, particularly in the independent sector. The CCN is calling on the government to manage councils\u2019 high-needs deficits in the event the override ends, and to change the Send system. Kate Foale, a Send spokesperson for the CCN, said the survey showed the \u201cimmediate financial emergency\u201d facing councils, with only four out of 38 of those surveyed confident they could survive the decade. She said: \u201cThe current Send system works for no one. It does not work for parents, young people and councils alike, and during the last decade demand and costs have spiralled out of control, leaving local authorities with deficits that are unmanageable.

But Havana Marking\u2019s film isn\u2019t just a good documentary \u2013 it\u2019s a great one.</p> <p>Over 90 minutes, it follows investigators from the organisation Hope Not Hate as they track down far-right extremists. At first, this seems like an unnecessary endeavour: social media feels flooded with the \u201calt-right\u201d broadcasting their views. The race rioters in Britain \u2013 and in the US at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/19/charlottesville-white-nationalist-torch-marchers-indicted\">Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-capitol-american-carnage-washington\">the Capitol in 2021</a> \u2013 weren\u2019t exactly trying to conceal themselves. But as it continues, the importance of their work becomes increasingly evident. </p> <p>Marking, best known for the 2009 Sundance winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/26/afghan-star-film-review\">Afghan Star</a>, focuses on two heroic figures from Hope Not Hate. Patrik Hermansson is a senior researcher who infiltrated the fascists at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, at which about 50 people were injured and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other\">the counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed</a>. Here, he acts as a handler of sorts for Harry Shukman, a journalist who is \u201cvery interested in the far right\u201d, but has never before used a hidden camera. Shukman operates as an audience surrogate, with the more seasoned members of the team, led by Nick Lowles, Hope Not Hate\u2019s founder, explaining to him the strategy and significance of their mission.</p> <p>It is nail-biting work; Shukman and Hermansson frequently feel in extreme danger when a hidden camera could be detected or a slip of the tongue could expose them. We learn that these groups are aware they are being infiltrated, although they don\u2019t know by whom.</p> <p>But much like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/29/laurence-fox-loses-libel-battle-with-twitter-x-users-he-called-paedophiles\">Laurence Fox on X</a>, piling up libel lawsuit after libel lawsuit, these people seem incapable of shutting up. Nick Scanlon, Britain First\u2019s candidate for London mayor in May, uses just about every slur for Black people during a brief conversation with a relative stranger, recorded on a hidden camera. The activist Erik Ahrens praises the SS as \u201cthe elites\u201d. The academic Emil Kirkegaard spouts eugenics talking points with a side of fixation on penis size. Even the \u201crespectable\u201d face of the movement, Cambridge-educated Matt Archer, is surprisingly indiscreet when it comes to the goals of the Human Diversity Foundation, which is funded in secret.</p> <p>The eventual revelation of who is handing over the cash for the foundation is a gorgeous moment of triumph for the team \u2013 and one of the film\u2019s funniest moments. When Shukman returns to spill the beans to Hermansson and says: \u201cYou would never guess who it is,\u201d he is not exaggerating.</p> <p>Funny moments aside, this documentary uncovers a number of real dangers. Hope Not Hate reveals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/17/neo-nazi-jack-renshaw-who-planned-to-labour-mp-jailed-for-life\">a plot to murder the MP Rosie Cooper</a> and shows how far-right thugs are rallying online and how organisations such as the Human Diversity Foundation are aiming to influence policy. It is not as though Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson, is about to be elected prime minister, but the film shows the slow creep of the \u201cOverton window\u201d \u2013 whereby exposing people to the most extreme ideas makes diluted versions of them appear palatable, thus shifting to the right the range of policies that are politically acceptable to the mainstream.</p> <p>It also helps that Hermansson, who has infiltrated far-right and nationalist groups across the US and Europe, is a dignified figure who does not resort to hyperbole. This lends gravitas to the moment when he reflects grimly on seeing the rise of fascism and homophobia elsewhere: \u201cIt\u2019s scary because I believe it could happen here as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/19/undercover-film-exposing-uk-far-right-activists-pulled-from-london-film-festival\">Undercover film exposing UK far-right activists pulled from London festival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That warning feels particularly prophetic given the UK race riots. The events of 30 July to 10 August \u2013 of people being attacked, buildings being burned, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/05/no-10-criticises-elon-musk-post-x-riots\">Elon Musk tweeting \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d</a> \u2013 are painful to watch. The film slows down a little as these moments play out; we see how the work bears down on the team from Hope Not Hate, who break through their despair to document the violence and identify the instigators, all while Lowles\u2019 life is being threatened online.</p> <p>The film made headlines on Saturday when the London film festival <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/19/undercover-film-exposing-uk-far-right-activists-pulled-from-london-film-festival\">cancelled a screening over safety concerns</a>. Lowles released a statement that read: \u201cSafety must always be an utmost priority. But we can\u2019t deny that it is disappointing to see the brave work of our staff being denied the widest possible audience. Now, more than ever, the true nature of the far right, in Britain and abroad, needs to be exposed.\u201d</p> <p>At least those watching on television will be exposed to the true nature of the far right \u2013 and one of the year\u2019s great documentaries.</p> <p>\u2022 Undercover: Exposing the Far Right is on Channel 4</p>",

Patrik Hermansson is a senior researcher who infiltrated the fascists at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, at which about 50 people were injured and the counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed. Here, he acts as a handler of sorts for Harry Shukman, a journalist who is \u201cvery interested in the far right\u201d, but has never before used a hidden camera. Shukman operates as an audience surrogate, with the more seasoned members of the team, led by Nick Lowles, Hope Not Hate\u2019s founder, explaining to him the strategy and significance of their mission. It is nail-biting work; Shukman and Hermansson frequently feel in extreme danger when a hidden camera could be detected or a slip of the tongue could expose them. We learn that these groups are aware they are being infiltrated, although they don\u2019t know by whom. But much like Laurence Fox on X, piling up libel lawsuit after libel lawsuit, these people seem incapable of shutting up. Nick Scanlon, Britain First\u2019s candidate for London mayor in May, uses just about every slur for Black people during a brief conversation with a relative stranger, recorded on a hidden camera. The activist Erik Ahrens praises the SS as \u201cthe elites\u201d. The academic Emil Kirkegaard spouts eugenics talking points with a side of fixation on penis size. Even the \u201crespectable\u201d face of the movement, Cambridge-educated Matt Archer, is surprisingly indiscreet when it comes to the goals of the Human Diversity Foundation, which is funded in secret. The eventual revelation of who is handing over the cash for the foundation is a gorgeous moment of triumph for the team \u2013 and one of the film\u2019s funniest moments. When Shukman returns to spill the beans to Hermansson and says: \u201cYou would never guess who it is,\u201d he is not exaggerating. Funny moments aside, this documentary uncovers a number of real dangers. Hope Not Hate reveals a plot to murder the MP Rosie Cooper and shows how far-right thugs are rallying online and how organisations such as the Human Diversity Foundation are aiming to influence policy. It is not as though Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson, is about to be elected prime minister, but the film shows the slow creep of the \u201cOverton window\u201d \u2013 whereby exposing people to the most extreme ideas makes diluted versions of them appear palatable, thus shifting to the right the range of policies that are politically acceptable to the mainstream. It also helps that Hermansson, who has infiltrated far-right and nationalist groups across the US and Europe, is a dignified figure who does not resort to hyperbole. This lends gravitas to the moment when he reflects grimly on seeing the rise of fascism and homophobia elsewhere: \u201cIt\u2019s scary because I believe it could happen here as well.\u201d That warning feels particularly prophetic given the UK race riots. The events of 30 July to 10 August \u2013 of people being attacked, buildings being burned, Elon Musk tweeting \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d \u2013 are painful to watch. The film slows down a little as these moments play out; we see how the work bears down on the team from Hope Not Hate, who break through their despair to document the violence and identify the instigators, all while Lowles\u2019 life is being threatened online. The film made headlines on Saturday when the London film festival cancelled a screening over safety concerns. Lowles released a statement that read: \u201cSafety must always be an utmost priority. But we can\u2019t deny that it is disappointing to see the brave work of our staff being denied the widest possible audience. Now, more than ever, the true nature of the far right, in Britain and abroad, needs to be exposed.\u201d At least those watching on television will be exposed to the true nature of the far right \u2013 and one of the year\u2019s great documentaries. \u2022 Undercover: Exposing the Far Right is on Channel 4",

      "bodyText": "Harrods has said more than 250 people are part of its process to settle compensation claims over alleged sexual misconduct by Mohamed Al Fayed. The department store in Knightsbridge, west London, said it had \u201csettled a number of claims with women\u201d made against its former owner since last year. It added that since the Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods documentary was broadcast by the BBC last month, there were more than 250 individuals \u201cnow in the Harrods process to settle claims directly with the business\u201d. The programme reported the claims of five women who said they were raped by Fayed, who died in 2023 at the age of 94, with several others alleging sexual misconduct. In a statement on Monday, Harrods said: \u201cSince 2023, Harrods settled a number of claims with women who alleged historic sexual misconduct by Fayed. \u201cSince the airing of the documentary, so far there are over 250 individuals who are now in Harrods\u2019 process to settle claims directly with the business.\u201d On Saturday Scotland Yard said a \u201cdetailed and thorough\u201d review of allegations against Fayed was taking place, amid criticism of their actions in response to women who said they had been abused. The force added that after recent media coverage and its public appeals for people to come forward and speak to the police, officers had been contacted by 60 people reporting their experiences. The Metropolitan police had asked prosecutors to decide whether to charge Fayed in relation to two out of 21 women who had made allegations, including of rape and sexual assault, between 2005 and 2023. Evidence was shown to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 2009 and 2015, but it decided not to go ahead with either case because there was not \u201ca realistic prospect of conviction\u201d. The Met sought \u201cearly investigative advice\u201d from the CPS after 10 other allegations, but no further action was taken. Last week, Ronnie Gibbons, a former Fulham women\u2019s captain, alleged she was sexually assaulted by Fayed, who was also the owner of Fulham football club, in 2000. Gibbons, who was 20 at the time, said she was forcefully kissed, groped and had twice felt trapped in a room by him. This month, the group Justice for Harrods Survivors said the number of women \u201cfeeling safe to come forward\u201d was \u201cincreasing on a daily basis\u201d.",

Nine members of Force 100, a unit inside the Israeli Defence Forces, are the subject of criminal investigation over allegations that they sexually assaulted a prisoner at the Sde Teiman detention camp in the Negev desert, which human rights groups have dubbed \u201cthe Israeli Guantanamo\u201d. Israeli authorities have begun to wind down the centre, which was established as a holding centre and interrogation site for Palestinians suspected of involvement in last October\u2019s attack on Israel by Hamas, in which about 1,200 people were murdered and another 250 were taken hostage. The facility is said to have been the site of widespread physical and mental abuse, according to whistleblowers, with detainees kept shackled to hospital beds, blindfolded and forced to wear nappies. Electric shock treatment and force-feedings have also been reported, and detainees have allegedly been forced to stand for hours or sit on their knees. In one case, whistleblowers reported one man having a limb amputated due to injuries caused by the persistent wearing of handcuffs. Up to 35 inmates are believed to have died in the facility or at hospitals nearby. About 4,000 prisoners were said to have passed through the facility by last May, the New York Times reported. Axios, citing two Israeli officials, said the US embassy in Jerusalem had submitted a list of questions to Israel\u2019s foreign ministry regarding several incidents involving violations allegedly carried out by Force 100 members. The embassy told the Israelis that the questions were part of a review under the auspices of the Leahy law. \u201cIt is part of a consultation process we started with the Israelis about this unit as part of our Leahy law agreement,\u201d Axios quoted a US official as saying. Named after the former Democratic senator for Vermont, Patrick Leahy, the legislation was passed in 1997 and originally designed to apply only to assistance in combating narcotics. But it was later expanded. The Guardian reported this year that US officials had taken steps to circumvent the law with regards to Israel to prevent the imposition of sanctions on a close ally. The state department did not respond to a request for comment. Reports of the investigation come after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Lloyd Austin, the defence secretary, warned in a joint letter last week that Israel could face consequences \u2013 including the potential blocking of future weapons transfers \u2013 if it did not take urgent steps to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza within the next month.",

Several Republican members of the state\u2019s House committee on criminal jurisprudence lined up to air their discontent with the handling of the case of Roberson, 57, who was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter Nikki Curtis in 2002 by violently shaking her. Roberson was accused of \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d, a diagnosis that in recent years has been called into question as a reliable forensic tool. The representative Jeff Leach told a hearing of the committee on Monday that he had come to be convinced that Roberson was \u201cfully innocent\u201d. And yet the prisoner, he said, had come \u201cwithin 20 minutes and 20 steps of being executed by the state of Texas\u201d. Monday\u2019s hearing of the committee not only amounted to one of the most dramatic outpourings of unease by Republican state politicians in a death penalty state about the flaws of the capital system, but it also temporarily spared Roberson\u2019s life. It was the committee\u2019s issuing of a subpoena for the death row inmate to appear before it last Thursday night that persuaded the state\u2019s supreme court temporarily to stay the execution, even as Roberson was sitting waiting to be escorted into the death chamber. Roberson had been scheduled to answer the subpoena and appear before the committee at Monday\u2019s hearing. But such is the level of political conflict now engulfing the Roberson case that Republicans have become pitted against Republicans. Texas\u2019s attorney general, Ken Paxton, refused to let the prisoner testify in person. In return, fellow Republican lawmakers refused to have the prisoner give testimony over conference call. \u201cThere are dramatic ways that we could enforce that subpoena,\u201d the chair of the committee, Joe Moody, told the hearing. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t issue the subpoena to create a constitutional crisis, and we aren\u2019t interested in escalating a division between branches of government.\u201d Committee members went on to vent their dissatisfaction at the way the state and state courts had handled the Roberson affair. \u201cWhen a man\u2019s life literally hangs in the balance, and we are contemplating the government exercising the ultimate and most awesome power of taking a life, then we cannot get this wrong,\u201d said the Republican representative Brian Harrison. He added: \u201cI want the state of Texas to lead the nation in just about everything, but executing potentially innocent people is not one of them.\u201d Had Thursday\u2019s execution have gone ahead, Roberson would have been the first person in the US to have been put to death on the basis of the contested allegation of shaken baby syndrome. The diagnosis came to prominence as a medical and later forensic hypothesis in the early 1970s. The idea quickly gained traction that violent shaking of an infant could cause severe illness and even death even where there was no sign of external head injury. The syndrome, or abusive head trauma as it is also known, is still considered a viable diagnosis by the American Academy of Pediatrics. But doubts about its reliability as a forensic tool have grown, especially where no other corroborating evidence is present. Since 1993 there have been 32 exonerations in 17 states following SBS convictions, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. At Monday\u2019s hearing Phillip McGraw, the clinical psychologist better known as the TV personality Dr Phil, told the committee that having studied the trial records and Nikki\u2019s medical history he had come to the firm conviction that there had been a miscarriage of justice in the case. He pointed out that scientific advances had shown that an infant could die from other causes other than violent shaking \u2013 in Nikki\u2019s case she had been acutely and chronically ill at the time of her death including with severe pneumonia. McGraw said that Roberson \u201chad not had due process \u2013 this man has not had a fair trial. If we start executing people in Texas absent due process and fair trial, we are going down a really dangerous road.\u201d",

The review, which will be chaired by the former Conservative justice minister David Gauke, will also reassess the jail time handed to offenders found guilty of crimes against women and girls, including those connected to domestic abuse. It has been ordered amid the overcrowding crisis in prisons in England and Wales but is expected to draw up \u201clong-term solutions\u201d, the Ministry of Justice says. The review comes on the day that 1,100 criminals serving sentences of five years or more will be released from prison early to ease the crisis. In September, the first early release of prisoners under the Labour government was criticised for being chaotic and poorly planned. The prison population in England and Wales has risen by 93% in the past 30 years and currently stands at just over 87,000. It is predicted to rise as high as 114,800 by March 2028. Labour has criticised the previous Tory government for failing to get the rising prison population under control. The new review will look at punishing thousands more offenders within the community as part of a 10-year capacity strategy, the MoJ said. One possibility is to give judges the powers to hand down sentences that force offenders to stay at home, while being monitored by electronic tags. At present, judges in England and Wales do not have the power to hand out explicit sentences that order criminals to be confined to an address. Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, said: \u201cTheoretically a judge could hand down a sentence of house arrest.

It still has to be punishment, they still have to have their liberty curtailed, people have to know and believe there are consequences to breaking our laws.\u201d In many US states, house arrest is seen as an alternative to prison and can be imposed so that an offender is confined to their home for days at a time. Using electronic bracelets, US offenders are often allowed to earn income, maintain family and other relationships, and attend probation appointments and substance abuse treatment. Officials have also been monitoring the use of compulsory \u201cnudge watches\u201d for those on probation, so that offenders could receive messages telling them when to turn up to appointments or comply with restrictions. A senior prison source said nudge technology could help offenders with \u201cchaotic\u201d lives. \u201cWe are particularly interested in nudge technology, like a wristwatch that says: \u2018Have you got in touch with your probation officer?

Inmates in Texas can cut down the amount of time spent behind bars by earning credit for good behaviour, as well as earning points for taking part in courses aimed at tackling the root causes of offending. Mahmood said the sentencing overhaul, along with plans to build 14,000 more prison places, was necessary if future governments were to avoid the need to order emergency measures to release criminals. \u201cWe have an opportunity now to reshape and redesign what punishment outside of a prison looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sentencing review will make sure prison and punishment work \u2013 and that there is always a cell waiting for dangerous offenders.\u201d Asked about sentences related to violence and women and girls, Mahmood said: \u201cWe want the review to consider the broader framework when it comes to sentencing, particularly because in order to meet our commitment on halving the levels of violence against women and girls.\u201d On Sunday the Guardian reported that fewer women could be sent to jail under the review, including an examination of the impact of sentencing on people with caring responsibilities \u2013 which disproportionately affect female offenders. Gauke, who is leading the review, questioned the effectiveness of short sentences when he was justice secretary in 2019, and said there was a strong case for those of six months or less to be scrapped altogether. There was a \u201cstrong case to abolish sentences of six months or less altogether, with some closely defined exceptions, and put in their place, a robust community order regime\u201d, he said.",

The Spain midfielder was answering in context of a complaint made last week by Fifpro and the European Leagues to the European Commission regarding Fifa\u2019s imposition of the matchday calendar. \u201cIt has been a tricky and difficult topic for the past few months,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously we\u2019re players and love to play football. But at the same time we\u2019re reaching a level where players are getting injured and the game is not at the highest point. So it\u2019s best for everyone to get to a point where we can keep playing to give a spectacle. \u201cIf players don\u2019t rest there will be injuries and everyone wants to see the big names perform, do these amazing tricks and high-quality football. So hopefully we can get to an agreement where everyone is happy.\u201d",

Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace could feasibly both finish in the top half come May 2025, or could easily be relegated and most people would just shrug and think \u2018yep, makes sense\u2019.</p> <p>Palace finished last season like a train under Oliver Glasner, with Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton all starring under the Austrian manager. But this time around, Olise is departed, Eze is woefully out of form and Wharton, struggling with a groin injury picked up over the summer at the Euros, has yet to find the form or fitness that saw him included on <a href=\"https://x.com/GoldenBoyAwards/status/1846959873340121405/photo/1\">the latest \u2018Golden Boy\u2019 list</a>. New signings Maxence Lacroix and Eddie Nketiah are talented but have so far failed to fill the voids left by Joachim Andersen and (whisper it) Jordan Ayew. But the truth is that Glasner, along with the rest of us, are still trying to figure out what is going wrong.</p> <p>Forest are another conundrum. Very mediocre home form and excellent away form (four matches that include a win at Anfield and Southampton and draws at Chelsea and Brighton) mean Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side could spring into eighth with a victory tonight.</p> <p>Any win will be without their talisman, Morgan Gibbs-White (who is suspended for his red card against Brighton), manager Nuno (who is serving the first of a three-match suspension for his reaction to that red card) and a stadium ban for owner Evangelos Marinakis (who was found guilty of improper conduct following Forest\u2019s defeat against Fulham in September).</p> <p>That said, the City Ground under the lights always fun, especially with Big Chris Wood leading the line. Vibes are high in the east Midlands. Do join me for <strong>the 8pm BST kick-off</strong>. I have absolutely no idea what is going to happen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/100\"> <table

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading, and for your emails. Congrats to Forest, commiserations to Palace. Below is the updated league table. Until next time! Looking at Wood\u2019s goal again, it really is an absolutely stinking attempt at a save from Henderson. The Palace keeper, who started for England last week remember, got to the ball quite easily, but allowed the ball to creep under his forearm. Eeeeeeesh. Wood speaks to the cameras: We know we needed a home win. Thankfully we got it. We know how good [Gibbs-White and Ward-Prowse] are but we showed we\u2019ve got great quality in the squad. I was unlucky in the first half with a couple of chances but you\u2019ve just got to keep going. There\u2019s always going to be another opportunity. I don\u2019t score many from outside the box. I was just trying to hit it and hit the target. I think it trickled under Dean\u2019s arm there. He\u2019s asked about his celebration, which was the classic ball-under the jumper/thumb in mouth one. My wife and I found out we are expecting a baby girl a couple of days ago, so [the celebration] was a way of announcing that to the world. Peter Oh emails: \u201cIn a modern football twist on rock, paper, scissors, Forest wins this contest by \u2018Wood beats Crystal\u2019\u201d Chris Wood is good. And I\u2019m told he is a popular fantasy league pick, so there will be some happy neutrals tonight as well. I wrote this on the striker back in August. Chris Wood scored 15 goals (zero penalties) last season for Nottingham Forest. There is no doubt that they would be a Championship side without him, as Forest survived on 32 points last season, the lowest-ever safety total in the Premier League. In April, Opta crowned Wood the most clinical player in Europe, converting nearly 40% of his chances in 2023-24, which was also by far the best rate since their Premier League records began in 2003-04. Chris Wood proves the matchwinner! Forest\u2019s first home victory of the season, without Morgan Gibbs-White! 90+7 min: Palace have not been battered in any of their league games this season \u2013 three of their four defeats have been by a single goal \u2013 and this looks like it\u2019s going to be the case again today. 90+5 min: Yellow card for Munoz, who catches Dominguez in Palace territory. 90+3 min: Chalobah swings in a hopeful but decent cross towards Mateta, and the Frenchman heads high and wide from around the penalty spot. 90+2 min: It\u2019s all Palace now. Forest are defending deep, with Palace getting the ball wide. Forest repel the crosses, for now. 90 min: Seven minutes added on. Plenty of time for Palace to get an equaliser. 89 min: Sarr releases Agbinone on the left and the substitute cuts the ball back to Eze on the edge. No Premier League player has taken more shots this season from outside the area than Eze, and Dominguez sprints out to make a brilliant block on the Palace man as he pulls the trigger. Great energy from the Argentinian. 88 min: Palace make a final change: Agbinone, another academy graduate on for Kamada, who has been quite poor. 86 min: Forest are playing well here. Managing the game well in Palace\u2019s half. Showing intent, but also valuing possession of the football to frustrate Palace. Williams and Jota Silva have looked lively since coming on. 84 min: Nasty clash of heads leaves Hudson-Odoi on the deck. The winger isn\u2019t going to be able to continue and gets to his feet gingerly after some treatment. Replaced by Ramon Sosa. Awoniyi is also coming on for the goalscorer, Chris Wood. 82 min: Palace are finally beginning to mobilise after going behind. Mateta makes himself useful in winning a couple of 50/50s in Forest\u2019s box. He cuts the ball back to Schlupp, who digs out a curler through a crowd of bodies towards goal. Sels sees it late but springs to his right and somehow turns the ball behind. Great save, that Schlupp effort was destined for \u2026 you guessed it \u2026 the Top Bin. 81 min: Mateta has barely had a kick since coming on but gets to the byline and digs out a cross to the near post, where Sels collects. Nobody in yellow was willing to gamble on that cross. 79 min: Some subs to keep you updated with. Forest: Elliot Anderson and Alex Moreno are off for Neco Williams and Morato. Palace: Schlupp and Ismaila Sarr replace Will Hughes and Tyrick Mitchell. 77 min: More good work from Anderson, who is my pick for the player of the match so far. The Forest man plays a neat one-two, leaves Lacroix on the deck before Guehi clears the danger. 75 min: \u201cInteresting that you write \u2018The Top Bin\u2019 in describing Eze\u2019s shot\u201d emails Gary Naylor. \u201cI always thought \u2018Top Bins\u2019 was the generic term for what used to be the \u2018Top Corner\u2019 and not a plural in the sense of a \u2018Top (left) Bin\u2019 and a \u2018Top (right) Bin\u2019. Is Susie Dent available at all?\u201d I always thought that the origin of the term came from Soccer AM, the Saturday morning football show, in which contestants and guests would literally shoot towards a bin in the top left and top right of the goal. So fairly sure I\u2019m right in saying that a singular top bin is fine. 73 min: Since the goal has gone in, it\u2019s Forest that are pressing for a second, rather than Palace pushing for an equaliser. 72 min: A neat lay-off from Wood releases Anderson, and the midfielder shoots at goal. It takes a deflection off Guehi and Henderson is forced to react and save with his right boot. 70 min: Bit of housekeeping, Dominguez has been booked, although I\u2019m not certain what for. Some are suggesting it was for kicking the ball away, although he did so from a Forest free kick \u2026 hmmm. 69 min: Palace make an immediate change: Mateta on for Nketiah, who I think is unfortunate to come off. Nketiah certainly thinks so, swearing and looking to the heavens as he slumps in his seat in the dugout. 67 min: Wood is just the third Forest player to score 20 Premier League goals, after Stan Collymore and Brian Roy. A goal out of nothing! Forest lump a hopeful ball forward, Wood latches onto a loose ball outside the box and shoots early, squeezing the ball in at the near post past a despairing Henderson. Replays show that it\u2019s a bit of a goalkeeping howler from the former Forest man, with the ball going under Henderson\u2019s elbow at the near post! Forest don\u2019t care one bit, of course. 63 min: Forest make a change: Elanga off for Jota Silva. 62 min: \u201cRe your David James video\u201d, emails James Humphries, \u201cto repurpose one of Big Nev\u2019s all-timers: well done, David, they\u2019re  about 15 between them?\u201d 60 min: So nearly a goal-of-the-season contender from Eze! But an absolutely magnificent save save from Sels denies the Palace man from range. Eze had hit a shot from a full 30 yards out, with the ball flying towards the top bin, but Sels just got a fingertip on it to turn it onto the bar and behind! What a shot, what a save! 58 min: Yates goes down right on the edge of Palace\u2019s box under a challenge from Kamada, but the referee waves play on! Palace break, with Nketiah striving away from Anderson in midfield. The Forest man takes matters into his own hands, brings Nketiah down and takes his booking. 57 min: Delighted to say this game has got its mojo back. Woof. 55 min: Palace\u2019s best move of the match! Nketiah sends Murillo to the shops with a neat stepover on the left flank, drives to the byline. The striker ignores a free Munoz at the back post, instead cutting the ball back to Hughes on the penalty spot, but Moreno makes a stupendous sliding block on the blonde Palace No 19. Great tackle, and an important one, Hughes\u2019 fierce shot looked goalbound. 54 min: Chance for Palace! Munoz swings in a better crosss, Eze volleys towards goal! It\u2019s a bit of a scuffed effort but still forces Sels into a save, the rebound falls kindly to Kamada, who has the whole goal at his mercy from five yards out \u2026 but the Japanese only knees the ball down into Sels again. Double save! Replays show that Kamada was offside, so the rebound wouldn\u2019t have counted, but it was still some miss! 51 min: Better from Palace, who are smoothly moving it through midfield but can\u2019t find the final pass. First Hughes plays a loose ball, then Munoz swings a wild cross over everyone after some promising touches. Glasner, on the sidelines, roars encouragement from the Palace dugout, clapping his hands willingly. 49 min: \u201cI\u2019m rarely as conscious of being haplessly addicted to the beautiful game as when I spend a",

Department for Work and Pensions analysis suggests the extra payments made by employers are expected to cost about \u00a3400m a year.</p> <p>In the analysis, the government said there were benefits that could not be easily quantified in terms of secure work and a more well-rounded family life. It said that 17m working days were lost due to stress, depression or anxiety, equivalent to more than \u00a35bn of lost output in a single year.</p> <p>Ministers and the Trades Union Congress have argued that the reforms are popular with voters. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: \u201cDespite repeated attempts to paint this bill as bad for business, this rigorous impact assessment shows that the business costs are negligible and are more than offset by the wider economic and social gains.</p> <p>\u201cThese changes will mostly affect those companies whose business models have been built on low-paid, insecure employment.\u201d</p> <p>A separate poll ahead of the budget shows voters want ministers to spend money repairing Britain\u2019s public services, even if it means increasing debt and even breaking manifesto pledges on tax.</p> <p>Polling by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, carried out by Persuasion UK and shared with the Treasury and No 10, shows that swing voters in particular prioritise spending money on the public sector over reducing tax.</p> <p>The swings were even more pronounced among those who had switched their vote at the last election than among the voting population as a whole.</p> <p>The polling also shows voters are more likely to react favourably to the argument that Labour is having to raise taxes and borrowing to rebuild public services rather than to fix a budget black hole left behind by the previous government.</p> <p>There are signs the message is being heard at the top of government. Whitehall sources confirmed on Monday that Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, had agreed to top up the government\u2019s affordable housing programme after a standoff between her and Rayner.</p> <p>Reeves is likely to give less than \u00a31bn to the fund, however, despite warnings from social housing providers that they would need at least an additional \u00a32bn before the programme expires in 2026.</p>",

Based on current patterns, the new rights could also lead to a significant rise in mediation or legal action \u2013 an increase of about 15%, which would mean an extra 20,000 additional complaints to the Acas mediation and arbitration service, 4,750 more employment tribunal cases and 875 additional cases which may require a full hearing. Other costs likely to be incurred are up to \u00a31bn in the changes to statutory sick pay, and about \u00a3100m in costs each for new rights such as bereavement leave, day one paternity leave and unpaid parental leave. Department for Work and Pensions analysis suggests the extra payments made by employers are expected to cost about \u00a3400m a year. In the analysis, the government said there were benefits that could not be easily quantified in terms of secure work and a more well-rounded family life. It said that 17m working days were lost due to stress, depression or anxiety, equivalent to more than \u00a35bn of lost output in a single year. Ministers and the Trades Union Congress have argued that the reforms are popular with voters. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: \u201cDespite repeated attempts to paint this bill as bad for business, this rigorous impact assessment shows that the business costs are negligible and are more than offset by the wider economic and social gains. \u201cThese changes will mostly affect those companies whose business models have been built on low-paid, insecure employment.\u201d A separate poll ahead of the budget shows voters want ministers to spend money repairing Britain\u2019s public services, even if it means increasing debt and even breaking manifesto pledges on tax. Polling by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, carried out by Persuasion UK and shared with the Treasury and No 10, shows that swing voters in particular prioritise spending money on the public sector over reducing tax. The swings were even more pronounced among those who had switched their vote at the last election than among the voting population as a whole. The polling also shows voters are more likely to react favourably to the argument that Labour is having to raise taxes and borrowing to rebuild public services rather than to fix a budget black hole left behind by the previous government. There are signs the message is being heard at the top of government. Whitehall sources confirmed on Monday that Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, had agreed to top up the government\u2019s affordable housing programme after a standoff between her and Rayner. Reeves is likely to give less than \u00a31bn to the fund, however, despite warnings from social housing providers that they would need at least an additional \u00a32bn before the programme expires in 2026.",

      "bodyText": "It is an event that has shocked the entertainment world. Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, according to a federal indictment unsealed in September that reads like a laundry list of criminal behavior including kidnapping, forced labor, bribery and other crimes. He faces even more allegations of sexual misconduct, after a Texas-based attorney revealed he is representing 120 accusers who allege misconduct against Combs over the course of two decades. In the past two years, Combs has hit the headlines in various ways that meant the mystique surrounding one of the biggest names in American music and popular culture was already deeply tarnished. Here is a timeline of events: 16 November 2023 Casandra Ventura files a lawsuit alleging horrific attacks and abuse Casandra Ventura, a singer and model known as Cassie who dated Combs for more than a decade, files a lawsuit against him, alleging incidents of rape and physical assault between 2007 and 2018. She describes \u201ca cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking\u201d after being lured into a \u201costentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle\u201d allegedly designed to keep her compliant \u2013 including engaging in sex acts with others against her will. The lawsuit also alleged that he destroyed the car of another successful US rapper, Kid Cudi \u2013 real name Scott Mescudi \u2013 to deter him from seeing Ventura. Combs denied the allegations. The severity of Ventura\u2019s allegations are the most serious Combs has faced.. He was charged with assault in 1998 and sentenced to an anger management class; in 1999 he was acquitted of gun charges following a nightclub shooting. In 2019, an ex-girlfriend, Gina Huynh, spoke to a blogger alleging emotional and physical abuse during her relationship with Combs, but no legal case was filed. 17 November 2023 Ventura settles lawsuit Ventura and Combs announce their lawsuit has been settled with undisclosed terms. Ventura said in a statement: \u201cI have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\u201d 24 November 2023 Two new lawsuits filed over sexual attacks Combs is accused of sexual assault dating back to 1991 in two new lawsuits: one anonymously by a woman who claimed Combs and another man coerced her into sex; the other by Joi Dickerson-Neal, who alleged Combs drugged and sexually assaulted her, as well as filming the incident and showing it to others. Later, on 26 April 2024, Combs\u2019s lawyers file a motion to dismiss elements of Dickerson-Neal\u2019s lawsuit. These lawsuits, and some of the other subsequent ones filed against Combs, were made possible by New York state laws such as the Adult Survivors Act and the Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Act that allowed for lawsuits alleging sexual assault to be made even if the statute of limitations \u2013 ie the window of time for the allegations to originally be made \u2013 had expired. 29 November 2023 Combs steps down as chair of Revolt Combs steps down as chair of the TV network he founded, Revolt. The following week Hulu scraps plans for a reality show, produced by James Corden\u2019s company Fulwell 73, that was to focus on Combs and his family. 6 December 2023 Combs denies all allegations Combs denies all allegations made against him in the preceding weeks, including in a new lawsuit filed by another anonymous woman who alleged Combs gang raped and sex trafficked her when she was 17. \u201cI did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth,\u201d Combs said. 26 February 2024 Combs sued by Rodney Jones Combs is sued by the music producer Rodney Jones who alleges Combs groped him and attempted to \u201cgroom him into accepting a homosexual relationship\u201d, during sessions for Combs\u2019s 2023 release The Love Album: Off the Grid. A lawyer for Combs describes the allegation as \u201cpure fiction\u201d, and later, on 26 August, Combs calls on a judge to throw out the case. 25 March 2024 Raids at Combs\u2019s properties in LA and Miami According to unnamed law enforcement sources, US federal agents raid Combs\u2019s properties in Los Angeles and Miami as part of a sex trafficking investigation. No charges are made against Combs at this stage. 17 May 2024 CNN publishes shocking footage of Combs assaulting Ventura CNN publishes surveillance footage of Combs assaulting Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. The following day, Combs apologises, saying: \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\u201d 22 May 2024 Crystal McKinney files a suit The model Crystal McKinney files a lawsuit against Combs, alleging that he drugged her and forced her to perform oral sex in a 2003 incident. Later that week, another woman, April Lampros, files her own lawsuit alleging four instances of sexual assault between 1995 and about 2000, as well as the allegation that Combs filmed one of the incidents and showed it to others. 7 June 2024 Howard University revokes honorary degree Howard University in Washington DC announces that it is revoking an honorary degree it awarded Combs, returning a $1m donation and ending a scholarship program in his name. The following week, Combs is ordered to return the ceremonial key to New York City by mayor Eric Adams, who wrote that he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the video footage of Combs assaulting Ventura. 4 July 2024 Combs says he is innocent as faces eighth lawsuit Via his lawyers, Combs again proclaims his innocence as he faces his eighth lawsuit alleging sexual assault. Adria English claims she was \u201cgroomed into sex trafficking over time\u201d in events between 2004 and 2009 at Combs\u2019s famous, star-studded \u201cwhite parties\u201d. \u201cNo matter how many lawsuits are filed it won\u2019t change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,\u201d the lawyer Jonathan Davis says. 10 September 2024 Combs a no-show at a hearing Combs does not appear at a virtual hearing for a lawsuit filed against him by Derrick Lee Cardello-Smith, who had alleged he was drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs at a party in Detroit in 1997. The no-show leads to a default judgement against Combs of $100m to be paid to Cardello-Smith, who is currently incarcerated following an unrelated case. Combs\u2019s lawyers say they hope to have the case dismissed, claiming Combs had never heard of Cardello-Smith; on 13 September, emergency motions are filed by Combs\u2019s legal team to try to overturn the ruling. 11 September 2024 Another lawsuit is filed by Dawn Richard Following Ventura, another high-profile musician files her own lawsuit against Combs. Dawn Richard, who was part of the Combs-signed girl group Danity Kane and later a trio with him called Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money, alleges that Combs sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions by touching her body, as well as verbally abusing and overworking her. She also alleges seeing him physically assault Ventura on numerous occasions. 16 September 2024 Combs is arrested and charged in New York Combs is arrested in New York and charged with three counts of sex trafficking and racketeering, in a federal indictment that describes \u201ca criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice\u201d. 17 September 2024 Combs denied bail in sex-trafficking and racketeering case Combs is denied bail and ordered to jail as he faces charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. He appears in court in New York and pleads not guilty. His lawyers try unsuccessfully to keep him out of jail, requesting his release to home detention, travel restrictions and $50m bond in Manhattan court. Prosecutors argue that Combs is \u201ca serious flight risk\u201d and has \u201cthe money, manpower and tools\u201d to flee without detection. 24 September 2024 Thalia Graves files lawsuit against Combs Thalia Graves alleges in a new lawsuit filed on 24 September that Combs and his bodyguard sexually assaulted her some two decades ago and distributed video of their attack. 1 October 2024 Combs faces sexual misconduct allegations from 120 accusers Tony Buzbee, a Texas-based attorney, revealed at a press conference that he is representing 120 accusers who allege misconduct against Combs over the course of two decades. Andrew Van Arsdale, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, told the Washington Post that there will be 120 individual lawsuits filed in New York, Los Angeles and Miami in the coming weeks. He said more than than 3,000 individuals come forward to his office with accusations against Combs. Buzbee said that the new civil claims against Combs will include \u201cviolent sexual assault or rape, facilitated sex with a controlled substance, dissemination of video recordings, sexual abuse of minors\u201d. 10 October 2024 Combs sex-trafficking trial to start in May 2025, judge decides Combs\u2019s sex-trafficking trial is scheduled to start on 5 May, 2025. During an appearance in Manhattan, prosecutors revealed that authorities seized 96 electronic devices in raids of Combs\u2019s Miami and Los Angeles homes, as well as a private airport in South Florida. Prosecutors said Combs might face more charges, something they have floated during prior court proceedings. Combs\u2019s lawyers have pushed unsuccessfully to get him freed on bail since his 16 September arrest. 14 October 2024 Combs hit with six new lawsuits alleging rape and sexual assault Combs was hit with six new lawsuits that accused the rap impresario of raping women, sexually assaulting men and molesting a 16-year-old boy. The plaintiffs in the lawsuits, filed anonymously in federal court under New York\u2019s Gender Motivated Violence Act, were identified only as two women \u2013 Jane Does \u2013 and four men, John Does. The accusers are part of what their attorney says is a group of more than 100 alleged victims who are in the process of suing Combs in the wake of his arrest in September. In a statement, attorneys for Combs said the tip line and new filings are \u201cclear attempts to garner publicity\u201d. The statement maintains that \u201cMr Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone \u2013 adult or minor, man or woman.\u201d 15 October 2024 Combs wants prosecutors to disclose the names of his accusers Combs wants prosecutors in his sex-trafficking case to disclose the names of his accusers, Manhattan federal court documents show. The music executive needs to know the identities of his accusers to prepare for the 5 May trial, his legal team argued in a Tuesday letter to Judge Arun Subramanian. 21 October 2024 Five new federal civil lawsuits filed A wave of new sexual assault and rape accusations have been made against Combs, including an accusation of rape from a then 13-year-old. Five new federal civil lawsuits have been filed against Combs. Among the plaintiffs, two are men and three are women. All of the alleged incidents reportedly occurred at parties hosted by the music mogul. In one lawsuit, the Jane Doe claims that in 2000, when she was 13 years old, Combs invited her to attend his MTV Video Music Awards afterparty where she was allegedly drugged and raped. All five lawsuits were filed in the southern district of New York by the Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee. \u201cWe expect to be filing cases weekly naming Mr Combs and others as defendants as we continue to gather evidence and prepare the filings,\u201d Buzbee said in a statement to NBC News.",

The party, which has been rocked by a number of recent controversies north and south of the border in Ireland, said police had been informed and the staffer suspended. It later said they had resigned. The DUP said the portrait was removed from a wall and the glass in its frame smashed during an event on Saturday evening to celebrate an Irish language group\u2019s 20th anniversary. The portrait of Wallace Browne was painted by the Jewish artist Israel Zohar, it said. In a social media post, the DUP leader, Gavin Robinson, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the motivation was sectarian bigotry, antisemitism, wanton destruction or a heady mix of the three \u2026 but [it\u2019s] a disgrace.\u201d The Police Service of Northern Ireland said that at 4.50pm on Monday, they had received a report of criminal damage to an artwork in Belfast City Hall. It piles the pressure on a beleaguered party which has seen four high-profile resignations in recent weeks. In a statement released on Monday evening, a Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson said: \u201cToday, 21 October, a Sinn F\u00e9in employee, who works in the assembly, made the party chief whip aware of their involvement in an incident regarding a portrait in Belfast City Hall which took place on Saturday 19 October. \u201cThe employee was immediately suspended, and we have notified the PSNI today. The employee has now resigned from their employment and their party membership.\u201d The incident comes just days after revelations that a former Belfast mayor, Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile, had quit Sinn F\u00e9in last year after the party received complaints that he had sent inappropriate texts to a teenage party member. Three weeks ago, two press officers also resigned after they gave a reference to another senior press officer who has admitted a series of child abuse offences. Last week one of its most respected TDs in the D\u00e1il, Brian Stanley, also quit over allegations of gross misconduct, which he said had been handled in an internal \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. With a general election in the republic due to be held in November or December, opposition parties are exploiting Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s difficulties for maximum electoral gains. A Sunday Times poll over the weekend showed the party dipping to 16% support from a high of 30% two years ago.",

But as the confetti rained down inside the Barclays Center while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/13/ellie-elephant-new-york-liberty-mascot\">Ellie the Elephant twerked away</a> to Empire State of Mind amid the roars of 18,800 spectators, it was easy to forget just how down bad the Liberty were under their previous caretakers \u2013 and how extraordinary the ensuing turnaround has been.</p> <p>Six years ago when the club was still the property of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvGE2jXLBAo\">wannabe rock star</a> indifferent to women\u2019s basketball, the Liberty languished in what could be described as a state of hostile neglect. When James L Dolan couldn\u2019t immediately find a buyer after putting the Liberty up for sale in November 2017, the team found themselves banished to the Westchester County Center in White Plains, roughly 30 miles outside Manhattan. Suddenly a team that consistently ranked near the top of the league in home attendance even in down years was playing their games in a rickety 5,000-seater constructed before the Great Depression. Predictably, average attendance plummeted below 2,200 while the team finished next to bottom of the standings with a dismal 7-27 record.</p> <p>Organizational morale was at rock bottom when Joe and Clara Wu Tsai bought what they saw as an undervalued asset for an undisclosed amount in 2019, but things changed rapidly under their ownership. Moving the team to the Barclays Center, which the Tsais took over with their purchase of the NBA\u2019s Brooklyn Nets, was a no-brainer. Seizing on changes to the 2020 collective bargaining agreement that relaxed restrictions on player movement, Wu Tsai tracked star free agent and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/07/breanna-strewart-sue-bird-seattle-storm\">serial winner Breanna Stewart</a> down to a yacht in Turkey <a href=\"https://justwomenssports.com/reads/new-york-liberty-breanna-stewart-turkey-wnba-free-agency/\">to make a recruiting pitch</a>. The Liberty went on to sign the two-time WNBA finals MVP and All-Star point guard Courtney Vandersloot as free agents, and traded for former MVP Jonquel Jones, to join a young core led by former No 1 draft pick Sabrina Ionescu and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton. That newly formed superteam came two wins short of a title in their first year before going all the way on Sunday night. More importantly, Liberty games have become a legitimate Brooklyn happening, a shift that can be seen everywhere from surges in attendance, ticket revenue and corporate sponsorships to their <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a62057394/ellie-elephant-new-york-liberty/\">zeitgeist-crashing viral mascot</a>, who has more followers across social media than nearly half of the roster.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we bought the team four years ago, they were playing at Westchester County Center to a crowd of 2,000,\u201d Wu Tsai <a href=\"https://x.com/erikslater_/status/1848197568804651307\">said</a> during Sunday\u2019s trophy presentation. \u201cAnd the first thing we wanted to do was bring the team to Barclays Center so that they could have a bigger stage.

      "body": "<p>\u201cTo become a professional football player from the place where I was born and raised was almost impossible. It was super, super tough,\u201d Oleksandr Zinchenko says as his eyes widen and we consider how far he has come from his small home town of Radomyshl in northern Ukraine. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have&nbsp;many facilities and we trained&nbsp;only twice a week, for one game, and this is not the way to become a professional. It was a pure joy to play and train with my local team but I was always wanting&nbsp;more. My&nbsp;mother said she saw the fire in my eyes to make it.\u201d</p> <p>We sit in a light and airy room on a beautiful autumn afternoon in Hampstead. In Ukraine, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance\">devastating war</a> grinds on, winter will be another brutal test. Zinchenko picks up his phone. \u201cThis morning my aunt sent me a video,\u201d he says. \u201cShe has been working in a nursery for more than 30 years. The video shows where she was hiding in the shelter from 7.30 until 10.30 because there was a siren. Working with kids, she cannot take any risk.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/18/charlie-patino-arsenal-deportivo-la-coruna-interview-new-challenge\">Charlie Pati\u00f1o: \u2018I\u2019d been at Arsenal a long time. I wanted a new chapter\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Arsenal defender and Ukraine captain cannot shake the war from his mind. His mother still lives in Radomyshl and he confirms that \u201call my family are in Ukraine\u201d. Zinchenko, who is 27, pauses. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m more helpful talking here than over there. You have footballers playing in the Ukrainian league and there is suddenly a siren. All of them need to hide in the shelter. I\u2019m showing these videos to my [Arsenal] teammates and they can\u2019t believe we are living this life. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p> <p>We will soon discuss Zinchenko\u2019s new autobiography, Believe, written with the skilful help of Raphael Honigstein, as it offers fascinating insights into the tactics, demands and revelations of playing for Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. It is also a moving account of Zinchenko\u2019s life in Ukraine and how&nbsp;he has been thrust into a position of national importance.</p> <p>Zinchenko recalls how, when meeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he cut all formalities to say: \u201cMr&nbsp;President, this isn\u2019t part of the script, but these words come from deep inside my heart. All my family and friends feel the same. I&nbsp;don\u2019t know what would happen to&nbsp;our country if you weren\u2019t there.\u201d Zinchenko shakes his head.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I\u2019m trying to put myself in [Zelenskyy\u2019s] place but this is impossible. I don\u2019t know this pressure \u2013 but looking into his eyes you can see how tough everything is. You see it from pictures of when he became president, and his face now. Every time I\u2019m reading the news, I\u2019m praying it will finish soon because I know how many people died from this war.\u201d</p> <p>Zinchenko strives to be diplomatic when asked if he fears that the world has turned its attention away from Ukraine. \u201cI can\u2019t be grateful enough for everything that people around the world are doing for us. This help could be in different ways. Some people can donate, some people can take refugees. Even seeing a sticker with a Ukrainian flag on a car gives me a boost and belief that we are not alone. At the same time I understand there is some fatigue with this war. But listen, if you put yourself in our position, we&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;give up, right? That\u2019s why we need to stick together as this is the only way to show justice and to bring peace.\u201d</p>    <p>Football offers respite, despite Zinchenko\u2019s recent struggle with injury. On Tuesday night, in the Champions League, Arsenal are at home against Shakhtar Donetsk, the Ukrainian club where he faced difficulties at the start of his career. Zinchenko was determined as a 17-year-old to find a route into regular first\u2011team football but Shakhtar were in thrall then to a group of talented Brazilians \u2013 Fernandinho, Willian, Douglas Costa and Alex Teixeira. Zinchenko asked the club if they saw him as a genuine prospect or simply as a player to farm out on loan. When the less flattering perspective became obvious, Zinchenko refused to sign a new contract. With his existing deal having another year to run, the standoff escalated. As Zinchenko writes: \u201cI briefly thought about giving up. This was the darkest hour. I felt invisible.\u201d</p> <p>He stresses now that he still loves Shakhtar but, in February 2015, having just turned 18, he took&nbsp;desperate measures. Zinchenko joined Ufa in the Russian Premier League. A year later his world was transformed when, much to his disbelief, Manchester City signed him. City had tracked Zinchenko after spotting him at a Youth Champions League game between Shakhtar and Arsenal.</p> <p>Guardiola had just become City manager and Zinchenko jumped at the opportunity without negotiating a rigorous contract. As he notes in his book: \u201cThe City lawyers said: \u2018Look, this is an academy player contract, right? As soon as you make your first official game for City, we\u2019re going to extend your contract with the real money that we pay full professionals. Not this academy player deal. So trust us.\u2019 Of course I said yes. Follow the dream. But do you know when my next contract came? The one that put me on full professional money? After I had played 43 games in the Premier League! I won two Premier League titles playing on an academy contract.\u201d</p> <p>Zinchenko realised that football is a harsh business, but today he is far more interested in the positive experiences of learning so much under Guardiola. When I ask if he has followed City\u2019s battle with the Premier League , which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-manchester-citys-hearing-and-charges\">charged the club with 130 breaches of its financial rules</a> \u2013 City deny any wrongdoing \u2013 Zinchenko shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not following this at all. I\u2019m just focusing on the football,\u201d he insists. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening there.\u201d</p>    <p>It\u2019s an understandable deflection, especially considering the increasingly intense rivalry between City and Arsenal. Zinchenko, instead, provides compelling accounts of being managed by Guardiola and Arteta. At first he would be mentally exhausted after every training session under Guardiola because the level of coaching, and the amount of information he had to absorb, was almost overwhelming.&nbsp;The fierce intelligence and relentless drive of Guardiola soon inspired him.</p> <p>Zinchenko learned that Guardiola never shouted, and his team talks at half-time always carried a message of positive reinforcement. But you don\u2019t become the best manager in the world without a ruthless mentality.&nbsp;Zinchenko looks rueful when he remembers the day that he made the mistake of questioning Guardiola after he had criticised a pass in training.</p> <p>\u201cOut loud I said: \u2018Mister! Like, I just did one wrong pass, you know?\u2019 And his reaction was incredible,\u201d Zinchenko writes in his book. \u201c\u2018Oh, okay, sorry, sorry, Mr Zinchenko. Sorry,\u2019 said Pep. \u2018Okay, guys, thank you, everyone inside.\u2019 And he went in, walked to the changing room. Training over, all because I talked back. I knew I was in trouble.\u201d Zinchenko was on the bench for the next game.</p> <p>\u201cListen, first of all, I was not right,\u201d he acknowledges now. \u201cI understood straight away, but it would have been silly if I went right to his office and apologised. It was game day minus one and I knew his head was totally on the gameplan. But I did apologise after the game.\u201d</p> <p>Guardiola forgave Zinchenko and their bond strengthened. On the night City <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/11/manchester-city-scrap-their-way-to-a-first-champions-league-win\">won the treble in June 2023</a>, a year after Zinchenko had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/16/arsenal-reach-verbal-agreement-to-sign-oleksandr-zinchenko-manchester-city#:~:text=Arsenal%20reach%20verbal%20agreement%20to%20sign%20Manchester%20City's%20Oleksandr%20Zinchenko,-This%20article%20is&amp;amp;text=Arsenal%20have%20reached%20a%20verbal,the%20region%20of%20%C2%A330m.\">left for Arsenal</a>, Guardiola called him. \u201cI can only imagine how much they celebrated after the game, and I guess no one was sleeping that night, but to get a call from Pep? I couldn\u2019t believe it. He said: \u2018Alex, you are a big part of this.\u2019 I was fully surprised in a good way. I said to him, again, a massive thanks for everything he did for me. It shows how good-humoured he could be.\u201d</p> <p>Zinchenko talks amusingly of how Arteta keeps his squad energised and aware of the need to remain vigilant. It emerged in the summer that the Spaniard once&nbsp;brought in a group of professional pickpockets to steal things from his oblivious players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2024/aug/13/david-squires-on-mikel-arteta-maverick-arsenal-team-building-efforts\">at a team-bonding exercise</a>. Their watches and wallets were soon returned. Zinchenko was not a victim that time but he was picked out by Arteta in a different stunt.</p>    <p>\u201cWe stayed at the same hotel before a match,\u201d Zinchenko recalls, \u201cand we knew all the waiters. But there was a new guy that day. So before we go to the stadium [Arteta] said: \u2018OK guys, let me wake you up, because we need energy. Last time, Alex, we played staff against players and you beat [the set-piece coach] Nicolas [Jover]. Let\u2019s do it the same, but freestyling. Everyone was like: \u2018What? For sure, Alex will beat him, blah blah blah\u2019. Nico started to do something with the ball and then suddenly it looks like he got an injury. It was so obvious but weird. Then they called the new waiter. We didn\u2019t know he was a professional freestyler. He destroyed me with his tricks and all of us were in deep shock. But then we were all laughing and we went to the game with good energy.\u201d</p> <p>When Zinchenko arrived at Arsenal in 2022 he and Gabriel Jesus, his former City teammate, agreed: Arsenal had the talent if not quite the conviction. \u201cI remember me and Gabi said: \u2018Wow, the quality is unbelievable and the energy and desire to learn every day is there. The only piece missing is belief.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>We talk before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/bournemouth-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">poor display in defeat at Bournemouth</a> last Saturday and Zinchenko suggests that Arsenal now have this belief. \u201cYes, I think so. That\u2019s what I feel in&nbsp;the dressing room and on the pitch. That\u2019s what I see from everyone now.\u201d</p> <p>Zinchenko, nursing his injured calf, was at home last month when he watched Arsenal, down to 10 men, hold off City at the Etihad Stadium until they finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/22/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">conceded a 97th-minute equaliser</a>. \u201cI dropped a message in the group chat after the game. I just said: \u2018You fucking warriors. Honestly, you are warriors.\u2019 Wow, the second half was unbelievable because we all know how tough it is to play away against the best team in the world.\u201d</p> <p>His face lights up but I wonder how he copes with this protracted injury? \u201cNo one deals with this well, because it\u2019s super tough. But in these moments you remember that in some parts of the world people walk for 20km to get a piece&nbsp;of bread. So you tell yourself:&nbsp;\u2018How can you complain?\u2019 But of course it\u2019s painful to not be part of the team.\u201d</p> <p>He is hopeful that he is \u201cnot far\u201d from returning. But Zinchenko faces a struggle to force his way back into the team as Jurri\u00ebn Timber and Riccardo Calafiori have been such impressive additions at full-back. \u201cAt City, every single time I had a major competition for my place with one of the best players in the world. It\u2019s positive for the club because these kinds of players make the team better.\u201d</p> <p>This fiery resolve and unified positivity has taken Zinchenko all the way from Radomyshl to north London, and it will surely sustain him in the testing months ahead at Arsenal and, far more urgently, for Ukraine. He stretches out his hand and smiles, as determined as ever to make the most of life, despite the challenges and difficulties.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/believe-9781526674692/\"><em>Believe</em></a><em> by Oleksandr Zinchenko is published by Bloomsbury.</em></p>",

On Friday, a court in Rome ruled to transfer back to Italy the last 12 asylum seekers being held in the new Italian migration hub in Albania. The ruling has cast doubt on the feasibility and legality of plans by the EU to explore ways to establish migrant processing and detention centres outside the bloc as part of a new hardline approach to migration. The group of individuals, who had arrived at the port of Sh\u00ebngjin from Lampedusa onboard a military vessel last week, were among the 16 people transferred for the first time to the designated facility in Gjad\u00ebr under the agreement between Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, aimed at holding men who are intercepted in international waters while trying to cross from Africa to Europe. Four of the 16 men were immediately sent back to Italy on Thursday, including two who were underage and two who were deemed as vulnerable. The remaining 12 individuals whom the Rome judges ordered be transferred back to Italy were returned via the port of Bari on Saturday in a blow to Meloni that risks turning the initiative into what aid workers and opposition groups have deemed a \u201ccomplete failure\u201d and a \u201cfinancial disaster\u201d. Meloni\u2019s party, the far-right Brothers of Italy, angrily condemned the decision on social media, blaming \u201cpoliticised magistrates\u201d who \u201cwould like to abolish Italy\u2019s borders. We will not allow it.\u201d Italy\u2019s justice minister, Carlo Nordio, attacked the judges, saying \u201cthe definition of a safe country cannot be up to the judiciary\u201d. The dispute that has sparked the clash revolves around the definition of what constitutes \u201csafe countries\u201d of origin. The 16 asylum seekers hailed from Egypt and Bangladesh, countries deemed safe by Italy, and therefore, according to the government, they should have been repatriated to their countries of origin. However, the judges ordered their transfer to Italy, saying the men could be at risk of violence if repatriated, effectively upholding the 4 October ruling of the European court of justice that the Italian government appeared to have overlooked. As a general rule, EU law takes precedence over conflicting national laws. The EU court made it clear that a country not entirely safe cannot be deemed safe, underlining that the condition of insecurity, even if limited to a specific part of the country, such as a certain region, could lead to the entire country being deemed unsafe. The council of ministers approved the decree after an emergency meeting held late Monday afternoon. The aim of the new law is to draw up a new list of safe countries, which can be updated every six months, and to allow a court of appeal to reconsider rulings that order the transfer of asylum seekers to Italy. From now on, the country of origin will be a primary condition for repatriation. Meloni\u2019s government hopes in this way to bind the magistrates\u2019 decision to government decrees and not to international laws. \u201cIn compliance with the ruling of the European court of justice, countries that contain unsafe territorial areas are excluded from the list: Nigeria, Cameroon and Colombia,\u201d said the undersecretary to the presidency of the council, Alfredo Mantovano, in a press conference at Palazzo Chigi after the council of ministers\u2019 meeting. Meloni said: \u201cWe will continue to work tirelessly to defend our borders.\u201d The row between the judges and the government escalated further on Sunday when Meloni published excerpts on social media of a letter sent by one prosecutor to a group which includes judges. In it, Judge Marco Patarnello warned that Meloni was \u201cstronger and much more dangerous\u201d than the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who faced frequent legal woes and who repeatedly attacked the judiciary. Rightwing politicians said the letter proved the legal bias against the government. Critics said however that Meloni did not post the rest of the text, in which Patarnello said \u201cwe must not engage in political opposition, but we must defend jurisdiction and the citizens\u2019 right to an independent judge\u201d. On Monday, the president of the judiciary\u2019s union, Giuseppe Santalucia, said: \u201cWe are not against the government, it would be absurd to think that the judiciary, an institution of the country, is against an institution of the country like political power.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Metropolitan police firearms officer who shot an unarmed suspect in the head has been acquitted of murder. Sgt Martyn Blake shot Chris Kaba in September 2022 after stopping him on a residential street in Streatham, south London. Kaba, 24, was being followed while driving an Audi that police believed was linked to a firearms incident the previous evening. The unanimous not guilty verdict, which took just three hours to reach, fuelled police anger that Blake was ever put on trial. The decision to charge Blake, who had never fired a shot on duty before, had already infuriated his fellow firearms officers as well as the force\u2019s commissioner, Mark Rowley. The commissioner called the system \u201cbroken\u201d as his officer walked free from the Old Bailey on Monday, with police chiefs lobbying ministers to make it harder for such a trial to happen again. Police believe they have won a \u201cpolicy package\u201d from government, the Guardian understands, as they press for reform of a system which they claim punishes them for doing their job. Kaba\u2019s family said they were \u201cdevastated\u201d by the verdict in the face of \u201cunimaginable grief\u201d, with his supporters saying it gave police \u201cimpunity\u201d to kill. His father, Prosper, had to be helped out of the courtroom after the verdict; another relative rocked back and forth. A visibly relieved Blake, 40, exhaled as the decision was read out, and hours later the Met said his suspension was lifted. He was flanked by police colleagues as he left the courtroom. The police watchdog will consider whether he should still face disciplinary action for gross misconduct, and an inquest looms. Scotland Yard remain on heightened alert in case of trouble and are closely monitoring community tensions. Dozens of people gathered near the Old Bailey on Monday evening, where a number of speakers demanded justice for Kaba and his family. A banner read: \u201cWe Keep Each Other Safe\u201d. Other supporters held placards saying: \u201cJustice for Chris Kaba\u201d. Supporters chanted: \u201cSay his name: Chris Kaba\u201d and \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d. One of the speakers called for people to join a march on Saturday in central London, and said Kaba\u2019s family would be there to hand a letter into 10 Downing Street. After the verdict, Rowley, who is struggling to recruit and retain enough officers for his embattled force, said: \u201cSgt Blake made a split-second decision on what he believed was necessary to protect his colleagues and to protect London. The jury decided that was an honestly held belief and the force used was reasonable. \u201cAny fatal use of force understandably prompts huge concern among communities, particularly in Black communities where trust in policing is low \u2026 We know incidents like this place further strain on already challenged relationships. \u201cNo police officer is above the law, but we have been clear the system holding police to account is broken.

We will continue fighting for Chris, for justice, and for real change. Chris\u2019s life mattered, and nothing can take that away from us.\u201d Police stopped the Audi not knowing who the driver was, only that it was potentially linked to a shooting the night before. The vehicle Kaba had been driving was forced to stop and was then surrounded by armed officers, who burst out from three police cars and tried to pull the suspect out. Blake, who was in a police car that blocked the Audi from the front, said he opened fire fearing Kaba would pull an officer under its wheels or run them over, as their suspect tried to escape \u201cat any cost\u201d after being blocked in. He said the car was being used as a weapon and he had fired in self-defence and also to protect his colleagues, with his primary aim being to \u201cincapacitate\u201d the driver, who was hunched low over the steering wheel. The prosecution said the Audi was blocked within seconds and could not have escaped nor run over officers at the point Blake shot. The crown accepted that Kaba made \u201cconcerted\u201d efforts to escape, but his Audi\u2019s top speed during the standoff was 12mph. Scores of Met armed officers walked out when Blake was charged. The force feared a conviction could have led to a fresh and potentially bigger rebellion, and held discussions with army leaders about soldiers coming on to London\u2019s streets. Temi Mwale and Kayza Rose, of the Justice for Chris Kaba Campaign, said: \u201cThis outcome reinforces the harsh reality that police can kill without consequence. No one can be safe while the police can kill with impunity.\u201d The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: \u201cThe British tradition of policing by consent relies on mutual bonds of trust between the public and the police. It is important both that the police have the confidence of communities they serve and that officers have the support and confidence they need to do the difficult job of keeping us safe.

      "bodyText": "Hurricane Oscar has dumped heavy rain across the eastern end of Cuba, adding to a list of woes already besetting the Caribbean\u2019s biggest island, which was hit over the weekend by a huge power cut. The deluge caused landslides, and winds of 75mph tore the roofs off houses, making work even more difficult for the engineers trying to get Cuba\u2019s electricity grid up and running again, after a weekend when the entire country of about 10 million people was plunged into darkness. \u201cThe winds have been very high,\u201d said a resident of the eastern city of Baracoa. \u201cThe sea is very dangerous and tiles have been ripped from the roof.\u201d As Hurricane Oscar was reduced to a tropical storm and began to turn north towards the Bahamas on Monday, the focus returned to the collapse of Cuba\u2019s electrical grid, caused by the country\u2019s antiquated electricity plants. In recent months blackouts have become so severe that people have been losing the food they store, a disaster in a country with soaring inflation and prices. Over the weekend Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, Cuba\u2019s president, appeared in the military style uniform of the National Defence Council, which only happens in times of national emergency and usually due to severe weather. The latest crisis began last week when all non-essential workers in the vast bureaucracy were ordered home, in the forlorn hope of saving power and keeping the grid operating. On Sunday it was announced that schools would be closed until Thursday, another very unusual event on an island that prides itself on keeping children in class. Electricity was restored across much of the centre of the island on Monday, but reports suggest the lights are out in both the far eastern reaches \u2013 where Oscar hit \u2013 and Pinar del R\u00edo in the far west. In Havana, the electricity began returning in the early hours of Monday, with neighbourhoods gradually coming back online one after another. By lunchtime, the government said 56% of the city had power. But Habaneros remained suspicious whether the antiquated electricity system would hold and there was grumbling that the government was giving information via Twitter/X, rather than by radio, even as phones have been dying from lack of charge. In July 2021, blackouts sparked unprecedented street protests involving thousands of people. This time, expressions of discontent have been muted, with residents in several Havana neighbourhoods banging pots. D\u00edaz-Canel on Monday blamed Cuba\u2019s trouble on the United States\u2019 \u201cfinancial war\u201d against Cuba, aiming his comments at online activists in Miami urging Cubans onto the streets. \u201cWe will not allow anyone to act by provoking acts of vandalism and much less by disturbing the civil tranquility of our people,\u201d he said.",

Unite spent \u00a3112m of its members\u2019 money under its previous leadership on the project in Birmingham, which has since been valued at just \u00a329m. Sharon Graham, who took over as Unite general secretary in 2021, commissioned two separate inquiries into the hotel project and affiliated services provided to members such as car and home insurance. Unite confirmed that the Serious Fraud Office was now looking at the case, as first reported by the BBC.

Unite shared the two independent reports \u2013 one by a senior lawyer and another by a firm of accountants, Grant Thornton \u2013 with police after they uncovered what the union said were \u201cvery serious concerns about potential criminality\u201d. The trade union\u2019s plan to build the 195-bedroom complex \u2013 which began under the leadership of former general secretary Len McCluskey \u2013 had been forecast in 2015 to cost about \u00a335m, but ended up more than three times that. The hotel project was intended to be an investment for Unite, as well as saving costs for its own events, with a 1,000-person capacity conference centre. It was completed in 2020. Employment tribunal documents, seen by the Guardian, show that the union believed its ruling executive council had been misled over the true value of the Birmingham project. In April 2022, South Wales police and HM Revenue and Customs raided Unite\u2019s offices in central London as part of a separate investigation into allegations of bribery, fraud and money laundering connected to the hotel project.

During his press conference, Trump encouraged voters in North Carolina to get out and vote, despite the destruction in the state. He also pointed to the Biden administration, saying the White House has limited Fema\u2019s recovery efforts, deciding to instead spend money on \u201cillegal migrants\u201d, implying it may have been done to possibly influence the 2024 elections. \u201cThey were not supposed to be spending the money on taking in illegal migrants, maybe so they could vote in the election, because that\u2019s a lot of people are saying that\u2019s why they\u2019re doing it \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I hope that\u2019s not why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Trump said. Fema is under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which also oversees the major federal immigration agencies: Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. \u201cThey\u2019ve spent it on illegal migrants,\u201d Trump said, in reference to federal government money. \u201cMany of them are murderers, many of them are drug dealers, many of them come out of mental institutions and insane asylums, and many of them are terrorists.\u201d Immigration has been a major campaign issue for both political parties. As Republicans accuse Democrats of being \u201csoft\u201d on immigration enforcement policies, the Democratic party has shifted to the right, pushing for tougher immigration policies. This year, the Biden administration put in place significant changes to asylum policy, restricting access to asylum at the US ports of entry. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts Trump, in similar fashion to his 2016 presidential campaign, has continued to demonize immigrants and asylum seekers, claiming they are bringing more crime to the USand placing Americans at risk and using racist language and imagery. Last month, the Trump-Vance campaign circulated false rumors that Haitian immigrants were eating pets in Ohio. The campaign also promoted false and sensational rumors that a Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment complex in Colorado. \u201cThey spent money to bring these people into our country, and they don\u2019t have the money to take care of the people from North Carolina and other states,\u201d Trump said on Monday about the Biden administration. Trump also said that, if he is elected, he would help reconstruction efforts in North Carolina by slashing \u201cevery bureaucratic barrier\u201d and would recruit businesses to operate in the state \u201cthrough the proper use of taxation incentives and tariffs \u2013 one of the most beautiful words that nobody understands, or very few people understand\u201d.",

Rees said she had \u201cnever been so relieved\u201d as when police were eventually called in May 2017 \u2013 more than a year after executives were first alerted to concerns about Letby \u2013 but admitted she and other managers were \u201call at fault\u201d for not contacting them sooner. She told the Thirlwall inquiry she initially believed the suspicions about Letby were fuelled by a \u201cpersonal\u201d dislike of her by two consultant paediatricians. The inquiry, chaired by Lady Justice Thirlwall, is examining the events surrounding the murder of seven babies and attempted murder of seven more by Letby in the year to June 2016. The BBC\u2019s Panorama programme reported on Monday that \u201cnew evidence\u201d suggested the nurse, who is serving a whole-life prison term, harmed more babies in her care \u2013 including a third possible insulin poisoning. It cited medical records appearing to show that the newborn had been administered insulin shortly after Letby took over his care in November 2015. Tests later revealed the baby had congenital hyperinsulinism \u2013 a condition where the body produces too much insulin \u2013 but experts told the BBC this could not explain such an exceptionally high insulin reading for the infant. Letby\u2019s legal team disputed the allegation and suggested the tests used to record blood insulin levels were unreliable. It is understood that Cheshire constabulary investigated this insulin case before Letby was charged in November 2020. At the inquiry, Rees said she believed she was made aware of concerns about the rise in deaths on the neonatal unit in either December 2015 or January 2016, at least four months after she took over as head of nursing for urgent care in August 2015. Rees said she was not involved in any meetings with senior doctors who raised concerns about Letby\u2019s connection to the series of unexpected and unexplained deaths as early as June 2015. She said one of the consultants, Dr Stephen Brearey, told her in late June 2016 that his concerns were based on \u201cgut feeling\u201d and suggested that a \u201cdrawer of doom\u201d in his desk contained evidence that implicated Letby in harming babies but that he refused to share the details. Rees said Brearey had \u201cagitated\u201d that she remove Letby from the neonatal unit during two conversations on 24 June 2016 \u2013 immediately after the murder of two triplet boys that day \u2013 but that she had refused because she had not seen any evidence. She accepted that the concern of senior doctors should have been enough to withdraw the nurse from frontline duties, but that she felt \u201cbullied and intimidated into making a decision\u201d. She added: \u201cI thought it was personal and perhaps I was slighted by that.\u201d Rees admitted she became too close to Letby when she was tasked with supporting her after the nurse\u2019s removal from the unit in July 2016. Text messages shown to the inquiry show the head of nursing telling Letby \u201chang on in there girl \u2026 your nursing team are fully behind you. We will get through this.\u201d Another said: \u201cLet\u2019s hope we get closure this year!\u201d In December 2017, seven months after the police had been contacted, Rees texted Letby to say: \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to fight for you,\u201d the inquiry heard. The inquiry is expected to sit until early 2025, with findings published by late autumn of that year.",

So Max Baucus, candidate for Congress, <a href=\"https://helenair.com/baucus-begins-630-mile-trek/article_19482b00-f58e-5193-84f1-0022ca0e0681.html\">decided to trek 630 miles</a> across Montana and listen to people talk about their problems. \u201cAs luck would have it, on the first day, I walked into a blizzard,\u201d he recalls, pointing to a photo of his young self caked in snow. \u201cIt was cold! But the blizzard didn\u2019t last that long<em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>Baucus shed 12lb during that two-and-a-half month journey in 1974. He also made friends. The Democrat defeated a Republican incumbent and would soon go on to serve as a <a href=\"https://baucusinstitute.org/about-max-baucus/\">Montana senator for 36 years</a>. He never lost an election but saw his beloved home state undergo many changes. Among them is the prospect that Democrats like him are now facing political extinction.</p> <p>Jon Tester, a moderate Democrat who is one of Montana\u2019s current senators, is fighting for his political life in the 5 November election. Opinion polls suggest that he is trailing his Republican rival, Tim Sheehy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/senate-races-elections-to-watch\">Control of the closely divided Senate</a>, and the ability to enable or stymie the ambitions of a President Kamala Harris or President Donald Trump, could hinge on the outcome.</p> <p>The Senate race in Montana is widely seen as a litmus test of whether Democrats <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/jon-tester-democrats-great-plains.html\">can still win in largely rural states</a> that have embraced Trump\u2019s Republican party. It is also a study in whether the type of hyperlocal campaigning that Baucus practised half a century ago can outpace shifts in demographics, media and spending that have rendered all politics national.</p>    <p>\u201cMontana was not yet discovered<em>,\u201d</em> recalled<em> </em>Baucus, 82, sitting near old campaign posters \u2013 \u201cDemocrat Max Baucus walks for Congress\u201d \u2013 in the brick-and-wood <a href=\"https://baucusinstitute.org/\">institute that bears his name</a> on Bozeman\u2019s idyllic main street. \u201cThere was much more retail politics, knocking on doors, shaking hands, going all around the community, knowing people personally. There\u2019s a saying that Montana is one big small town and that was very true back then. It\u2019s not quite as true today.\u201d</p> <p>Tester, 68, a likable, unpretentious dirt farmer who is Montana through and through, epitomises the old retail politics. His campaign ads emphasise his rural background, including <a href=\"https://x.com/jontester/status/1016783285395980288\">three fingers missing on his left hand</a> \u2013 lost to a meat grinder that he still owns. He has been in the Senate for 18 years and praised for his work on behalf of the agriculture industry, military veterans and Native American communities.</p> <p>For some voters, such authenticity still resonates. <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/nels-johnson/\">Nels Johnson</a>, 62, who works for a conservation organisation in Bozeman, said: \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for Jon Tester because he\u2019s a third-generation Montanan, knows Montana values and what Montana hopes to be. His opponent is not as in touch.\u201d</p>    <p>Sheehy, 37, is an outsider by comparison. The former Navy Seal moved to Montana in 2014 to raise a family and start an aerial firefighting business. He is also cast in the Trump mould: he has no previous political experience, is hostile to the media \u2013 he has given few interviews \u2013 and has been dogged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/tim-sheehy-republican-senate-montana\">a string of controversies</a> over exaggerated or misleading claims about his past.</p> <p><a href=\"https://formergovernors.mt.gov/racicot/other/marcbio.asp\">Marc Racicot</a>, 76, a former governor of Montana and ex-chair of the Republican National Committee turned Trump critic, said: \u201cMr Sheehy is an acolyte of Donald Trump and so the shadow of Trump is going to influence his candidacy \u2013 what he\u2019s willing to do and able to do and also his character and capacity to govern in a way that reflects democratic virtues and values<em>.</em>\u201d</p> <p>Nowhere is the contrast between the candidates more palpable than in their relationship to this year\u2019s presidential nominees. In August, Sheehy stood alongside Trump, who won Montana overwhelmingly in the 2020 election, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?537538-1/president-trump-campaigns-montana\">at a rally in Bozeman</a>. No one is expecting Tester to hold a campaign event with Harris anytime soon. Indeed, he has declined to endorse her.</p>    <p>It is pragmatic calculation that recognises how Montana, which is about the size of Japan and has more cows than people, has altered since Tester came into office. The state has witnessed <a href=\"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/09/27/more-republican-voters-are-moving-to-montana-than-democrats/\">an influx of newcomers</a> from Arizona, Washington state, California and Texas. During the coronavirus pandemic, Montana had the third-highest rate of growth in the country.</p> <p>The state\u2019s politics have veered to the right. When Tester entered the Senate in 2007, Democrats held almost every statewide elected office in Montana from governor, secretary of state and attorney general to two of the state\u2019s three seats in Congress. But Republicans have steadily picked off one Democratic stronghold after another. Tester is now the last Democrat standing in statewide office.</p> <p>He has survived three close races before but this looks set to be his toughest yet: he has never run before when Trump was at the top of the ballot. By <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4821264-tester-keeps-harris-at-arms-length-amid-tight-senate-race/\">distancing himself</a> from the White House race, he is asking voters to split their ticket \u2013 something that is increasingly rare in the era of political tribalism and declining local media.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://montanafreepress.org/author/mike-dennison/\">Mike Dennison</a>, a veteran political journalist and analyst, said: \u201cRepublicans have totally tried to nationalise this race. Every chance they get, whenever they say Tester they say Biden or Harris. They want to tie him to the national Democrats and that\u2019s absolutely what Tester does not want to do.</p> <p>\u201cThe Republicans want to say this race is for control of the Senate. Tester doesn\u2019t want to talk about that at all. He wants to talk about himself and his issues. That is what\u2019s going on here: Democrats have had a tough time in rural America and Montana is certainly rural America.\u201d</p> <p>Republican-aligned groups are duly pumping millions of dollars into the race. Dennison added: \u201cThe amount of money in this race by Montana standards is just stunning. The prior race six years ago, when Tester ran and Trump came out to the state four times to campaign against him, was a $100m race. This is going to be a $250m race.\u201d</p>    <p>Yet for many of the voters whose screens are saturated with endless campaign ads, the number one issue is affordability. Cities such as Bozeman and Missoula have housing crises with many local people priced out.</p> <p><a href=\"https://thehrdc.org/our-team/\">Brian Guyer</a>, emergency and supportive housing director at the Human Resource Development Council (HRDC), a non-profit organisation in Bozeman that runs a shelter with capacity for 100 unhoused people, said there had been a sharp rise in individuals turning up with everything they own because of rent increases or shifts from long- to short-term rentals.</p> <p>Guyer said: \u201cThey end up seeking out overnight shelter because there aren\u2019t alternatives for them, which has turned into an odd dynamic here. We have your standard shelter guests \u2013 people who are dealing with addiction \u2013 but now we also have people who are actively participating in the Bozeman workforce but the cost of living is so expensive that the shelter is their only option in terms of places to stay. In a perverse way, this is workforce housing.\u201d</p>    <p>Sheehy has, unsurprisingly, attempted to fit the problem into a national framework. Borrowing from Trump\u2019s central campaign theme, he has argued with little evidence that immigrants are coming to the state and driving up the price of housing. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/zooey-zephyr-trans-politician-montana-interview\">Zooey Zephyr</a>, a progressive Democrat who is the first transgender member of the Montana state legislature, says: \u201cWe have seen from the top of the ticket of the Republican party an effort to take the issues our country is facing right now and blame it on an \u2018other\u2019. So, hey, let\u2019s ignore the fact the state of Montana had a multibillion-dollar surplus in 2023 and the legislature controlled by a Republican supermajority did not address the housing crisis adequately.</p> <p>\u201cNo, instead they\u2019re going to stoke fears that it has something to do with immigration being the main driver. We know the demographics of Montana are largely white, partially Native American, but they\u2019re going to drum up fear about a small percentage of people in the state and try to vilify them. That\u2019s a fear-based playbook that we\u2019ve seen Sheehy using but it is a playbook we have seen in every election cycle.\u201d</p>    <p>In fact, many of the new arrivals are members of Sheehy\u2019s own party, quitting liberal cities and drawn to Montana\u2019s clear air, open spaces and good schools (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/12/yellowstone-the-smash-hit-tv-show-that-exposed-a-cultural-divide\">the TV series Yellowstone</a> has also boosted the state\u2019s profile). Now nearly half of Montanas were not born in the state. They know or care little for Tester\u2019s long service or Montana\u2019s <a href=\"https://historicmt.org/items/show/2107\">independent streak</a>.</p> <p>Luke Huffines, 28, a forester, moved to Montana a month ago and will vote for Sheehy \u2013 if he can register in time. \u201cI like Sheehy\u2019s background,\u201d he said. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/tim-sheehy-gunshot-wound-montana-senate.html\">He\u2019s Navy Seal</a> and he\u2019s definitely got businesses going on. He\u2019s got private firefighting planes and whatnot and I feel like he\u2019s getting a lot of backlash because he\u2019s got his shit together. What\u2019s wrong with capitalism?\u201d</p> <p>Huffines is also a supporter of Trump. He explained: \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t give a shit. And he gets so much backlash and he just keeps moving forward.<em>\u201d</em></p>    <p>For their part, Democrats have branded Sheehy as exactly the type of rich out-of-stater who bought up multiple homes across Montana and helped drive up costs for locals. <a href=\"https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2024-09-19/montanas-housing-market-named-least-affordable-in-the-country\">A recent report </a>by the National Association of Realtors found that, in terms of wages versus prices, Montana now has the least affordable properties in the nation.</p> <p>Shane Doyle, 52, a Native American who lives in Bozeman, describes it as a \u201creverse gold rush\u201d. He said: \u201cThey\u2019re coming here to add to what has already been a white, gated, almost resort community. The town is filled with Republicans who have come here to feel comfortable around other white people and enjoy the amenities of the outdoors and the recreation of the waters and the skiing and the hiking.</p> <p>\u201cThe only place where you see minorities here in Bozeman is either on the college campus or on the outskirts of town. I\u2019m one of the very few Indians who lives here and has managed to find a career path that allows me the money to live here.\u201d</p> <p>Montana has seven Indian reservations and almost 70,000 Native Americans, representing about 7% of its total population, according to census data. The voting bloc has long leaned Democratic but Republicans have recently courted tribal leaders hoping to gain their support. Sheehy has faced demands to apologise over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/04/tim-sheehy-native-americans-montana-senate-candidate-republican\">past remarks he made</a> about Native Americans being \u201cdrunk at 8am\u201d and throwing beer cans at him on the Crow Reservation.</p>    <p>Tester has warned that Sheehy wants to sell off public lands to rich people and make Montana his own personal playground. Doyle, a member of the Crow tribe and executive director of the non-profit group Yellowstone Peoples, regards Tester as a \u201cstaunch supporter\u201d and believes that, if Democrats ran the state, there would be scope to bring back animals such as bison, elk, wolves and bears.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-guardian-live-world-news/id409128287?mt=8\">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Doyle said: \u201cTim Sheehy says he wants to protect public lands but we\u2019re all sceptical of that because we know he\u2019s very interested in privatisation. There\u2019s a lot of money to be made on Montana\u2019s public lands and I\u2019m afraid that, if we go full red, they\u2019ll be more emboldened to act on their agenda. That\u2019s going to be a bad thing for all Montanans because the crown jewel of Montana is our public lands. We have a lot to lose.\u201d</p> <p>Just as in other parts of the US, Doyle has seen the Montana Republican party lurch to the \u201cMake America great again\u201d (Maga) right and fan the flames of extremism. \u201cBozeman has become the epicentre of white supremacy,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of our elected officials here are along those lines. Bozeman has now become the home base for the Republican candidates and we haven\u2019t seen a lot of support from them for Indian Country.\u201d</p> <p>Doyle has seen truckers drive aggressively through town, flying flags and blowing black smoke. \u201cWe have groups here that are white supremacist and they are fully armed and they make themselves visible. They\u2019re intimidating, they\u2019re threatening and it\u2019s no fun to live around them. They didn\u2019t used to be here before Trump won.\u201d </p> <p>While affordability and immigration loom large, Democrats are pinning their hopes on reproductive freedom in the aftermath of the supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn the Roe v Wade decision. Next month\u2019s general election ballot will <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/montana-abortion-rights-constitutional-amendment-177266d09ce91e073407276e588868df\">include an initiative to enshrine abortion</a> rights in the state constitution, potentially galvanising many young, female and progressive voters.</p>    <p>If Tester is defeated by his less experienced but Trump-friendly opponent, one more blue dot will be extinguished. It will be a fresh data point in the great sorting between blue states and red states, between urban liberals and rural conservatives, between so-called coastal elites and flyover states.</p> <p>One factor in the polarisation is the decline of local newspapers and rise of talk radio and cable television, which offer national news through a partisan lens.</p> <p><a href=\"https://dailymontanan.com/author/ken-toole/\">Ken Toole</a>, 69, a Democrat who served in the Montana state senate, said he and his neighours agree on identifying problems such as taxes, the concentration of wealth and monopolies in the meatpacking industry. \u201cBut they just have absolutely no faith that Democrats can deal with that and we\u2019re talking about people who are sitting in their tractor all day listening to talk radio.</p> <p>\u201cI work cattle with my neighbours and talk to them pretty regularly \u2013 it\u2019s not like they\u2019re foaming at the mouth. Over time, the brand of Democrats in areas like this has just been eroded. The difficult question for me is, how do you build it back?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 October 2024. An earlier version referred to Montana\u2019s three seats in the House of Representatives in 2007, when instead it was three seats in Congress.</p>",

Mike Dennison, a veteran political journalist and analyst, said: \u201cRepublicans have totally tried to nationalise this race. Every chance they get, whenever they say Tester they say Biden or Harris. They want to tie him to the national Democrats and that\u2019s absolutely what Tester does not want to do. \u201cThe Republicans want to say this race is for control of the Senate. Tester doesn\u2019t want to talk about that at all. He wants to talk about himself and his issues. That is what\u2019s going on here: Democrats have had a tough time in rural America and Montana is certainly rural America.\u201d Republican-aligned groups are duly pumping millions of dollars into the race. Dennison added: \u201cThe amount of money in this race by Montana standards is just stunning. The prior race six years ago, when Tester ran and Trump came out to the state four times to campaign against him, was a $100m race. This is going to be a $250m race.\u201d Yet for many of the voters whose screens are saturated with endless campaign ads, the number one issue is affordability. Cities such as Bozeman and Missoula have housing crises with many local people priced out. Brian Guyer, emergency and supportive housing director at the Human Resource Development Council (HRDC), a non-profit organisation in Bozeman that runs a shelter with capacity for 100 unhoused people, said there had been a sharp rise in individuals turning up with everything they own because of rent increases or shifts from long- to short-term rentals. Guyer said: \u201cThey end up seeking out overnight shelter because there aren\u2019t alternatives for them, which has turned into an odd dynamic here. We have your standard shelter guests \u2013 people who are dealing with addiction \u2013 but now we also have people who are actively participating in the Bozeman workforce but the cost of living is so expensive that the shelter is their only option in terms of places to stay. In a perverse way, this is workforce housing.\u201d Sheehy has, unsurprisingly, attempted to fit the problem into a national framework. Borrowing from Trump\u2019s central campaign theme, he has argued with little evidence that immigrants are coming to the state and driving up the price of housing. Zooey Zephyr, a progressive Democrat who is the first transgender member of the Montana state legislature, says: \u201cWe have seen from the top of the ticket of the Republican party an effort to take the issues our country is facing right now and blame it on an \u2018other\u2019. So, hey, let\u2019s ignore the fact the state of Montana had a multibillion-dollar surplus in 2023 and the legislature controlled by a Republican supermajority did not address the housing crisis adequately. \u201cNo, instead they\u2019re going to stoke fears that it has something to do with immigration being the main driver. We know the demographics of Montana are largely white, partially Native American, but they\u2019re going to drum up fear about a small percentage of people in the state and try to vilify them. That\u2019s a fear-based playbook that we\u2019ve seen Sheehy using but it is a playbook we have seen in every election cycle.\u201d In fact, many of the new arrivals are members of Sheehy\u2019s own party, quitting liberal cities and drawn to Montana\u2019s clear air, open spaces and good schools (the TV series Yellowstone has also boosted the state\u2019s profile). Now nearly half of Montanas were not born in the state. They know or care little for Tester\u2019s long service or Montana\u2019s independent streak. Luke Huffines, 28, a forester, moved to Montana a month ago and will vote for Sheehy \u2013 if he can register in time. \u201cI like Sheehy\u2019s background,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s Navy Seal and he\u2019s definitely got businesses going on. He\u2019s got private firefighting planes and whatnot and I feel like he\u2019s getting a lot of backlash because he\u2019s got his shit together. What\u2019s wrong with capitalism?\u201d Huffines is also a supporter of Trump. He explained: \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t give a shit. And he gets so much backlash and he just keeps moving forward.\u201d For their part, Democrats have branded Sheehy as exactly the type of rich out-of-stater who bought up multiple homes across Montana and helped drive up costs for locals. A recent report by the National Association of Realtors found that, in terms of wages versus prices, Montana now has the least affordable properties in the nation. Shane Doyle, 52, a Native American who lives in Bozeman, describes it as a \u201creverse gold rush\u201d. He said: \u201cThey\u2019re coming here to add to what has already been a white, gated, almost resort community. The town is filled with Republicans who have come here to feel comfortable around other white people and enjoy the amenities of the outdoors and the recreation of the waters and the skiing and the hiking. \u201cThe only place where you see minorities here in Bozeman is either on the college campus or on the outskirts of town. I\u2019m one of the very few Indians who lives here and has managed to find a career path that allows me the money to live here.\u201d Montana has seven Indian reservations and almost 70,000 Native Americans, representing about 7% of its total population, according to census data. The voting bloc has long leaned Democratic but Republicans have recently courted tribal leaders hoping to gain their support. Sheehy has faced demands to apologise over past remarks he made about Native Americans being \u201cdrunk at 8am\u201d and throwing beer cans at him on the Crow Reservation. Tester has warned that Sheehy wants to sell off public lands to rich people and make Montana his own personal playground. Doyle, a member of the Crow tribe and executive director of the non-profit group Yellowstone Peoples, regards Tester as a \u201cstaunch supporter\u201d and believes that, if Democrats ran the state, there would be scope to bring back animals such as bison, elk, wolves and bears. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts Doyle said: \u201cTim Sheehy says he wants to protect public lands but we\u2019re all sceptical of that because we know he\u2019s very interested in privatisation. There\u2019s a lot of money to be made on Montana\u2019s public lands and I\u2019m afraid that, if we go full red, they\u2019ll be more emboldened to act on their agenda. That\u2019s going to be a bad thing for all Montanans because the crown jewel of Montana is our public lands. We have a lot to lose.\u201d Just as in other parts of the US, Doyle has seen the Montana Republican party lurch to the \u201cMake America great again\u201d (Maga) right and fan the flames of extremism. \u201cBozeman has become the epicentre of white supremacy,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of our elected officials here are along those lines. Bozeman has now become the home base for the Republican candidates and we haven\u2019t seen a lot of support from them for Indian Country.\u201d Doyle has seen truckers drive aggressively through town, flying flags and blowing black smoke. \u201cWe have groups here that are white supremacist and they are fully armed and they make themselves visible. They\u2019re intimidating, they\u2019re threatening and it\u2019s no fun to live around them. They didn\u2019t used to be here before Trump won.\u201d While affordability and immigration loom large, Democrats are pinning their hopes on reproductive freedom in the aftermath of the supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn the Roe v Wade decision. Next month\u2019s general election ballot will include an initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, potentially galvanising many young, female and progressive voters. If Tester is defeated by his less experienced but Trump-friendly opponent, one more blue dot will be extinguished. It will be a fresh data point in the great sorting between blue states and red states, between urban liberals and rural conservatives, between so-called coastal elites and flyover states. One factor in the polarisation is the decline of local newspapers and rise of talk radio and cable television, which offer national news through a partisan lens. Ken Toole, 69, a Democrat who served in the Montana state senate, said he and his neighours agree on identifying problems such as taxes, the concentration of wealth and monopolies in the meatpacking industry. \u201cBut they just have absolutely no faith that Democrats can deal with that and we\u2019re talking about people who are sitting in their tractor all day listening to talk radio. \u201cI work cattle with my neighbours and talk to them pretty regularly \u2013 it\u2019s not like they\u2019re foaming at the mouth. Over time, the brand of Democrats in areas like this has just been eroded. The difficult question for me is, how do you build it back?\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 October 2024.

Spacious, fast and pleasing on the eye, the east-west addition to the capital\u2019s underground network is a triumphant example of modern civic infrastructure. As this newspaper\u2019s architecture and design critic put it, here was proof positive that \u201cBritain is still capable of pulling off gargantuan transport infrastructure projects with style and panache\u201d.</p> <p>Sadly, beyond the south-east \u2013 and particularly in the north \u2013 such feelgood moments have been notable by their absence. Ten years after George Osborne\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.northernpowerhousepartnership.co.uk/northern-powerhouse-8-years-on%EF%BF%BC/\">northern powerhouse agenda</a> promised upgraded rail links across the north of England, travellers in Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds are still waiting on the platform for that new era to arrive. During that time, spending per capita on transport in London has been more than double that in the north. A dizzying series of Westminster policy delays, cancellations and U-turns have cumulatively undermined investor confidence and passenger morale from Liverpool to Leeds.</p> <p>The net result is the dispiriting shambles that has been inherited by the new Labour transport secretary, Louise Haigh. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a19b892-79dc-4977-b21a-ac55bd88fde4\">cancellation</a> of HS2\u2019s northern leg from Birmingham to Manchester threatens to leave an overburdened west coast mainline close to collapse, with knock-on effects for the M6. Plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), originally conceived as a high-speed east-west equivalent of London\u2019s Crossrail, have been downgraded and truncated, and remain shrouded in uncertainty. The same goes for a new transport deal for Bradford, which has the <a href=\"https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/need-for-northern-powerhouse-rail-laid-bare-as-britains-worst-connected-cities-revealed-11-11-2021/\">worst connections</a> of any major city in Britain. A decade of high-flown modernising rhetoric has made headlines, but left the north\u2019s Victorian and now dysfunctional transport infrastructure largely unaltered.</p> <p>Following <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/896d40a0-6090-4686-858c-31e85f0f0ff6\">representations</a> from Labour\u2019s northern metro mayors, Ms Haigh is reportedly exploring the possibility of a cheaper and slower alternative to the abandoned northern leg of HS2. That would be far better than nothing. But if Labour is serious in its ambitions to unlock growth in all parts of the country, it must find the boldness and imagination to do things differently.</p> <p>In his Labour-commissioned <a href=\"https://www.urbantransportgroup.org/system/files/general-docs/Rail%20and%20urban%20government_FINAL.pdf\">review</a> of rail and urban transport, the head of Great British Energy, Juergen Maier, cited Germany\u2019s Ruhr region as an example of better transport links driving greater productivity in the post-industrial era.

      "bodyText": "When London\u2019s new 73-mile Elizabeth line won the prestigious Stirling prize for architecture last week, the judges\u2019 choice proved a popular one. Spacious, fast and pleasing on the eye, the east-west addition to the capital\u2019s underground network is a triumphant example of modern civic infrastructure. As this newspaper\u2019s architecture and design critic put it, here was proof positive that \u201cBritain is still capable of pulling off gargantuan transport infrastructure projects with style and panache\u201d. Sadly, beyond the south-east \u2013 and particularly in the north \u2013 such feelgood moments have been notable by their absence. Ten years after George Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse agenda promised upgraded rail links across the north of England, travellers in Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds are still waiting on the platform for that new era to arrive. During that time, spending per capita on transport in London has been more than double that in the north. A dizzying series of Westminster policy delays, cancellations and U-turns have cumulatively undermined investor confidence and passenger morale from Liverpool to Leeds. The net result is the dispiriting shambles that has been inherited by the new Labour transport secretary, Louise Haigh. The cancellation of HS2\u2019s northern leg from Birmingham to Manchester threatens to leave an overburdened west coast mainline close to collapse, with knock-on effects for the M6. Plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), originally conceived as a high-speed east-west equivalent of London\u2019s Crossrail, have been downgraded and truncated, and remain shrouded in uncertainty. The same goes for a new transport deal for Bradford, which has the worst connections of any major city in Britain. A decade of high-flown modernising rhetoric has made headlines, but left the north\u2019s Victorian and now dysfunctional transport infrastructure largely unaltered. Following representations from Labour\u2019s northern metro mayors, Ms Haigh is reportedly exploring the possibility of a cheaper and slower alternative to the abandoned northern leg of HS2. That would be far better than nothing. But if Labour is serious in its ambitions to unlock growth in all parts of the country, it must find the boldness and imagination to do things differently. In his Labour-commissioned review of rail and urban transport, the head of Great British Energy, Juergen Maier, cited Germany\u2019s Ruhr region as an example of better transport links driving greater productivity in the post-industrial era. The same would apply to England\u2019s northern conurbations, but Treasury short-termism has repeatedly stymied the kind of transformative investment so desperately needed. The latest arm-wrestle over cash concerns a proposed \u00a317bn high-speed link between Liverpool and Manchester. Ominously, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has placed this project alongside other unfunded commitments by Rishi Sunak\u2019s outgoing administration. The Elizabeth line carried a price tag of \u00a319bn. It has been estimated that it may add \u00a342bn to the UK economy, and it is driving regeneration along the length of its route. The socioeconomic impact of similar investment and ambition in the north, following the decades of neglect, could be even more dramatic. Last week\u2019s award of the Stirling prize shone a light on the multiple and long-term benefits of investing big in public transport. It is time that lesson was finally learned and applied outside the capital. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "After the Met officer Martyn Blake was charged in 2023 with killing Chris Kaba, scores of his colleagues put down their guns in protest. But the outrage was not limited to the rank and file: the home secretary, Suella Braverman, publicly condemned the decision, and was followed by the Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley. This, in turn, led to an emergency legal hearing to address concerns about prejudicing the coming trial. And now, after a murder trial has ended in Blake\u2019s acquittal, the row is likely not only to become public once again, but intensify in its vehemence. The killing of Kaba, 24, in south London on 5 September 2022 was the latest chapter in a long debate over how Britain deals with fatal shootings by agents of the state. In the past, they have led to the worst riots to blight England since the war and mental anguish for those involved, including the families of both gunman and victim. There has also been pressure for reform of criminal and human rights laws \u2013 and how those using state-sanctioned lethal powers are held to account. But the loudest voices in Blake\u2019s defence will say he was mistreated, and that firearms officers need greater protections against prosecution. Police chiefs have been pressing for this and the government is considering whether to act, the Guardian understands. The Old Bailey trial that ended on Monday concerned just 13 seconds of activity: from the police stop of the Audi Q8 Kaba was driving to the point Blake fired a single bullet through the windscreen and into Kaba\u2019s head. Police believed the Audi had been involved in a firearms incident in south London the previous night. Those outraged by Blake\u2019s treatment view him as a dedicated public servant, put through the indignity of a murder trial. Blake\u2019s picture cannot be published and he fought to remain anonymous. Kaba had been on the phone and realised he was being followed, telling a friend: \u201cI think there is police behind me.\u201d The marked BMW car, in which Blake was sitting, was waiting in Kirkstall Gardens, a residential road in Streatham, as a police helicopter hovered overhead.

However, in Blake\u2019s case that did not happen, with defence barrister Patrick Gibbs KC telling the court the Audi had \u201cfar more room to manoeuvre than was safe\u201d. On police radio, commands of \u201cstrike\u201d and then \u201cdoors, doors, doors\u201d rang out as armed officers burst from their cars shouting \u201cshow me your fucking hands\u201d and surrounded the Audi.

During the trial, the jury heard how Blake was from a middle-class background, a voracious reader who first worked in finance before joining the Met to escape a desk job. In court Blake relied in part on a defence that so stressful and rapid were the events that some of his errors were the result of a psychological phenomenon called \u201cperceptual distortion\u201d, which leads to errors in memory. Critics, however, are sceptical. Since 2005, four men who were unarmed at the point they faced armed police have been shot dead by the Met in non-terrorist operations. They are Kaba, Jermaine Baker in 2015, Mark Duggan in 2011 and Azelle Rodney in 2005. All were black \u2013 a fact that is significant for some and coincidental for others. Rodney\u2019s killing led to the last murder trial of an armed officer, Tony Long, who in 2015 was acquitted by majority verdict. In all four cases the officer\u2019s account contained inaccuracies. That is not evidence of police wrongdoing, says Long, but because of perceptual distortion. Long told the Guardian: \u201cUnlike a camera that records everything perfectly the human brain has to record everything for a lifetime so it is constantly deciding what it needs to keep and what it does not. \u201cIn high-stress situations the brain remembers the key bits and discards other things so people get, for instance, the sequence wrong. \u201cIn my case 14 people, 12 police officers and two civilians, were witnesses, and not one of them got their evidence right.\u201d Long, who opened fire three times in his Met career, said of the decision to shoot: \u201cYou do not take it 10 minutes or even 10 seconds beforehand, you make it in a split second. \u201cIn my case, despite it being a long operation, I made that decision at the very last second.\u201d One former police chief said demanding armed officers, as the justice system expects, to accurately detail why they shot, while essential, is doomed to fail. Sir Peter Fahy was chief constable of Greater Manchester police when its officers shot an unarmed man, Anthony Grainger in 2012. Fahy told the Guardian: \u201cIt is the impossible and the unacceptable. By which I mean that it was impossible given the stress and speed of firearms incidents for officers to give a full and an accurate account, and it was unacceptable in a proper democracy for an agent of state to do anything otherwise, after they have used lethal force.\u201d",

She would have loved them. But if she\u2019d met me, she\u2019d have died of a heart attack within a minute \u2026 I brought them madness and an over-the-top aspect.\u201d</p>    <p>Deploying an impressively forthright and raunchy holler, Di\u2019Anno sang on the band\u2019s 1980 self-titled debut which reached No 4 in the UK charts, as well as its follow-up in 1981, Killers.</p> <p>By his own admission, though, Di\u2019Anno had issues with substance use. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that I was snorting a bit of coke \u2026 I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day,\u201d he later said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t see my way to the end of it.\u201d He had also described personality clashes with Harris. He was fired after the world tour for Killers, and replaced by Bruce Dickinson, who (aside from most of the 1990s) has been the band\u2019s frontman ever since.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/22/paul-di-anno-obituary\">Paul Di\u2019Anno obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Iron Maiden have paid tribute to Di\u2019Anno, writing: \u201cPaul\u2019s contribution to Iron Maiden was immense and helped set us on the path we have been travelling as a band for almost five decades.

      "bodyText": "Paul Di\u2019Anno, the journeyman heavy metal vocalist best known for fronting Iron Maiden in their early years, has died aged 66. His label Conquest Music confirmed that he died at home in Salisbury, adding: \u201cDespite being troubled by severe health issues in recent years that restricted him to performing in a wheelchair, Paul continued to entertain his fans around the world, racking up well over 100 shows since 2023.\u201d Born Paul Andrews in Chingford, east London, to a Brazilian father and British mother, Di\u2019Anno joined the nascent Iron Maiden after an audition in November 1978, the band having been formed by bassist Steve Harris three years earlier. Iron Maiden had already gone through two frontmen, and Di\u2019Anno was initially unimpressed: \u201cTheir old singer had this silly sword and fake blood dripping from his mouth and me and my mate were pissing ourselves laughing,\u201d he later said. \u201cBut when we started playing together it just seemed to gel.\u201d In another interview, he explained: \u201cThe Maiden boys were lovely young people you could have introduced to your nan. She would have loved them. But if she\u2019d met me, she\u2019d have died of a heart attack within a minute \u2026 I brought them madness and an over-the-top aspect.\u201d Deploying an impressively forthright and raunchy holler, Di\u2019Anno sang on the band\u2019s 1980 self-titled debut which reached No 4 in the UK charts, as well as its follow-up in 1981, Killers. By his own admission, though, Di\u2019Anno had issues with substance use. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that I was snorting a bit of coke \u2026 I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day,\u201d he later said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t see my way to the end of it.\u201d He had also described personality clashes with Harris. He was fired after the world tour for Killers, and replaced by Bruce Dickinson, who (aside from most of the 1990s) has been the band\u2019s frontman ever since. Iron Maiden have paid tribute to Di\u2019Anno, writing: \u201cPaul\u2019s contribution to Iron Maiden was immense and helped set us on the path we have been travelling as a band for almost five decades. His pioneering presence as a frontman and vocalist, both on stage and on our first two albums, will be very fondly remembered not just by us, but by fans around the world.\u201d Di\u2019Anno forged ahead with his own music, first with a self-titled project, then the equally short-lived supergroup Gogmagog, including former Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr and future guitarist Janick Gers. His next band, Battlezone, fared better, releasing two studio albums in 1986 and 1987. Di\u2019Anno had a spell fronting heavy metallers Praying Mantis, before forming another new band, Killers, who also released two studio albums. Further projects included the groups Nomad and RockFellas. He was jailed in the US in the early 1990s after assaulting a girlfriend with a knife, later saying: \u201cMy biggest regrets are those domestic violence incidents in my past, I\u2019m really ashamed of them.

Britain\u2019s National Hunt racing industry is at least twice the size of its Irish counterpart in terms of the number of races and meetings it involves and the prize money on offer, yet it heads into the 2024-25 season feeling even more like the junior partner than it did 12 months ago.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/19/jim-crowley-earns-redemption-after-shock-success-in-champion-stakes-on-anmaat-horse-racing\">Crowley earns redemption with shock success in Champion Stakes on Anmaat</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Willie Mullins\u2019s latest \u2013 and arguably greatest \u2013 achievement yet in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/26/willie-mullins-uk-horse-racing-national-hunt\">adding the British National Hunt trainers\u2019 championship</a> to his 18th title at home set the seal on another sobering season for British yards. Four Irish trainers \u2013 Mullins, Gordon Elliott (in fifth), Henry de Bromhead (14th) and Gavin Cromwell (20th) finished in the top 20 in the table, winning a combined total of \u00a36.5m in prizes.

And as Jonathan Mullin, Horse Racing Ireland\u2019s director of racing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/mar/10/racing-cheltenham-festival-ireland-dominance-britain\">pointed out earlier this year</a>, it is an issue for the Irish too, as \u201cthe biggest threat to Irish jumps racing is the demise of British jumps racing\u201d.</p> \n<p>At some point, there needs to be some rebalancing of power in the jumping world, and reclaiming the trainers\u2019 title from Mullins would be a good start. The trainer most likely to do so, according to the betting at least, is Dan Skelton, who seemed poised to take over from his former employer, Paul Nicholls, in the spring before Mullins\u2019s late charge through Cheltenham, Aintree <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/20/willie-mullins-macdermott-takes-thrilling-scottish-grand-national-on-line\">and Ayr</a> snatched the crown away.</p> \n<p>He has been typically busy over the summer, with more than 300 runners and \u00a3550,000 in prizes in the bank already, and is top-priced at 5-4 to remain at the top of the table until the end of the campaign.</p> \n<p>Skelton seems sure to have more runners than any of his rivals over the course of the season, as he did last time around. But while Grey Dawning, one of last year\u2019s top novice chasers, is a live hope for next month\u2019s Betfair Chase, he cannot hope to match Mullins in terms of the depth of quality in his yard. No one can, and a key factor in deciding the title race could be the extent to which the new champion is determined to defend his crown.</p> \n<p>The early signs, from the point of view of Skelton and his fellow British contenders, Paul Nicholls and Nicky Henderson, are not promising. Mullins did not send a single runner over jumps in Britain before the Showcase last year, whereas this time around, a scattering of his horses have already started popping up in some unexpected locations. Mullins has bagged winners at Fontwell, Worcester, Bangor and Warwick, and while \u00a320,000 in prizes is very small beer, it feels like an interesting statement of intent.</p> \n<p>If so, then the 7-4 on offer with one firm for a Mullins repeat could be a steal (and he is odds-on at 10-11 elsewhere). He has the top two in the Gold Cup betting in Galopin Des Champs and Fact To File, and immense strength in depth in every division. If he is going to be beaten, it is likely to require something of a collective revival among leading British trainers and their horses, at the spring festivals above all.</p> \n<p>The horse that everyone wants to see back in action is, of course, Henderson\u2019s unbeaten former champion hurdler, Constitution Hill. It is 10 months since his only start of 2023-24, a season that started with an abortive trip to Newcastle for a meeting that succumbed to the weather and then saw him ruled out of defending his Champion Hurdle crown in early March with a virus.</p> \n<p>Newcastle\u2019s Fighting Fifth Hurdle on 30 November is once again the target for Henderson\u2019s stable star, and while his appearances may be relatively few and far between, Constitution Hill is one of the stars that jumping urgently needs to give substance to the first half of the winter campaign.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4a577147-98d4-4603-af2c-152b6bf20864\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Ludlow </b>1.40 Nickelforce 2.10 Jafimgoso 2.45 Shakeyatailfeather 3.20 Regal.

She said the impact assessment published by the government today says the legislation will be good for growth.</p> <p>But, in an early intervention, the Conservative MP <strong>Graham Stuart</strong> said that document just said the measures might be good for growth. And, if there was a postive impact on growth, it would be small in magnitude according to the document, Stuart said.</p> <p>In the executive summary of<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67162540d100972c0f4c9abd/Employment_rights_bill_economic_analysis.pdf\"> its economic analysis</a>, the government says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We conclude the package could have a direct and positive impact on economic growth, but we expect this to be small.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is the more considered conclusion, from paragraphs 168 and 169.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On balance, we believe the impact on growth could be positive (i.e. the positive channels above outweigh the offsetting effects) but the direct impact would be small in magnitude. This is because the package is well targeted at low-paying sectors meaning that many of the channels covered above are less applicable for a large part of the economy. In addition, the evidence between employment rights and growth in the UK is limited, but where we do have strong, policy-specific evidence it often indicates that the policy has had a negligible effect on growth. For example, the national living wage, which has imposed a similar magnitude of costs on a similar part of the labour market in recent years as we expect the bill to have, has had a limited impact on productivity and participation (and by extension growth) in either direction. It is right that there is evidence linking flexible working to stronger productivity and this change will boost productivity for some workers and some employers, but the increase in uptake of \u2018making flexible working the default\u2019 is relatively small compared to the number of people employed and therefore, at a macroeconomic level, the impact on average productivity will be small.</p> <p>Whilst we conclude that the direct impact would be small, it is likely that by boosting protections and the quality of work for the poorest in the labour market, the package will enhance lower-paid workers\u2019 share in the benefits of growth and boost equality in work. This is more than just good for equality; it could be good for the economy too as there is evidence that equality is important for \u2018sustainable\u2019 growth over the long-term. For example, the OECD note that higher inequality can lead to underinvestment in human capital and weaker adoption of technologies. They estimate that as a result of rising inequality between 1990 and 2010 output in the UK was almost nine percentage points lower than it could have otherwise been. As a result, by increasing the security, quality and equality of work, it\u2019s possible that the bill could also indirectly support the government\u2019s mission to grow the economy beyond a small direct impact, helping to raise living standards across the country.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67166e168f08556b4172d981\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-21T15:18:45.477Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Braverman sent government documents to personal email address 127 times as attorney general, FoI case reveals</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Suella Braverman forwarded government documents to her private email accounts on at least 127 occasions when she was attorney general, according to a story by <strong>George Greenwood</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/suella-braverman-sent-government-documents-to-her-private-email-127-times-d9nnvftn7\">at the Times.</a></p> <p>The Attorney General\u2019s Office disclosed the figure after a lengthy Freedom of Information battle culminated in a tribunal finding against the government.

It will significantly strengthen workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>In its economic analysis, the government says that some of these new regulations will impose new costs on business.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the policies covered within the bill to impose a direct cost on business equivalent to low billion pounds per year. If we take the top-end of the range from our broad order of magnitude cost to business estimates in tables A3, A4, and A5 to get the maximum likely cost this sum to \u00a34.5bn [sic]. As such, we are confident that the total direct cost to business will be less than \u00a35bn annually. This represents a cautious assessment, and we expect the total cost to business to be refined downwards as our evidence improves and the policy development continues</p> <p>Nevertheless, to contextualise the size of this impact, total wage costs in the UK were \u00a31.3 trillion in 2023 in nominal terms, meaning that an annual cost of up to \u00a35bn is equivalent to an uplift of the UK\u2019s total pay bill of up to 0.4%. This cost will be concentrated on employers in lower paid sectors, but even if we assumed all of this cost falls on such sectors, then hypothetically the equivalent uplift in the wage bill for that part of the economy would be up to 1.5%.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report says the empirical evidence about who would pay the cost of stronger employment protections is \u201cambiguous\u201d. It says firms might pass on higher costs to customers. If they cannot do that, they might cut investment or training costs, or cut employment costs, it says.</p> <p>But the report says giving workers more rights will cut the number of days lost to stress, depression and anxiety, which it implies will more or less compensate for the increase in direct costs. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will be further benefits for those in work from better job satisfaction, as well as improved wellbeing and health, which could be amount to billions of pounds a year. This will benefit their employers too as 17.1 million working days were lost due to stress, depression or anxiety in 2022/233 , equivalent to over \u00a35bn of lost output.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the report says, overall, the impact of the bill will be positive.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are clear, evidence-based benefits of government action through the bill. Not acting would enable poor working conditions, insecure work, inequalities and broken industrial relations to persist.</p> <p>The bill will strengthen working conditions for the lowest-paid and most vulnerable in the labour market, increasing fairness and equality across Britain. It will have significant positive impacts on workers who are trapped in insecure work, face discrimination, or suffer from unscrupulous employer behaviour like \u2018fire and refire\u2019 practices.

Last year the country saw the highest number of working days lost to strikes since the 1980s \u2013 costing the economy millions of pounds. This has entrenched a culture of brinkmanship that only serves to damage public services, public finances, and public faith in institutions. Today is a significant step in putting an end to that \u2013 as the Employment Rights Bill reaches its second reading, alongside a package of consultations to help inform its next steps. This includes a consultation on our new approach to Statutory Sick Pay, where the Bill will be removing the waiting period and the Lower Earnings Limit.</p> <p>The Bill is expected to benefit people in some of the most deprived areas of the country by saving them up to \u00a3600 in lost income from the hidden costs of insecure work. Around 2.4 million people in the UK work irregular patterns like zero or low hours contracts or agency jobs, where insecure hours can mean forking out on expensive childcare or transport to cover last-minute shifts - or losing out altogether if work is changed or cancelled at short notice.</p> <p>New protections like guaranteed hours and giving reasonable notice or compensation for lost work will help shift workers keep up to \u00a3600 a year, including workers in the North and Midlands where irregular work is highest.</p> <p>For a cleaner working night shifts on an average annual wage of \u00a321,058, a \u00a3600 saving would be worth over \u00a3250 more a year than the last two national insurance cuts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6716591f8f0832d15c5fd225\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-21T13:39:41.919Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MPs will debate the second reading of the employment rights bill later this afternoon.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We feel really strongly that the best ideas aren\u2019t going to come from politicians in Whitehall.</p> <p>They\u2019re going to come from staff working right across the country and, crucially, patients, because our experiences as patients are also really important to understanding what the future of the NHS needs to be and what it could be with the right ideas.</p> </blockquote> <p>Streeting has used the term \u201cdeath sentence\u201d before in relation to patients\u2019 experience of the NHS (normally in relation to cancer, because some cancer survival rates are worse than in comparable countries).

Badenoch says that there is no point announcing policy so far ahead of the next general election, and that it is more important for the party to decide its values and principles. (This has not stopped her saying she would reverse Labour\u2019s imposition of VAT on private school fees.) </p> <p>Commenting on Badenoch\u2019s approach, Jenrick said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s disrespectful to the members and the public to ask for their votes without saying where you stand on the big issues facing our country today. </p> <p>A plan today is what I offer.

The DHSC explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Members of the public, as well as NHS staff and experts will be invited to share their experiences views and ideas for fixing the NHS via the online platform, <a href=\"https://change.nhs.uk/en-GB/\">change.nhs.uk</a>, which will be live until the start of next year, and available via the NHS App.</p> <p>The public engagement exercise will help shape the government\u2019s 10 Year Health Plan which will be published in spring 2025 and will be underlined by three big shifts in healthcare - hospital to community, analogue to digital, and sickness to prevention \u2026</p> <p>Bold ambitions for the NHS can only be achieved by listening to the expertise and knowledge of its 1.54 million strong workforce. Their understanding of what\u2019s holding them back from performing at their best will help us bring down waiting times and provide the world class care the public deserve.</p> <p>The government has already taken immediate action to address challenges in the health service and deliver an NHS fit for the future. Whether that\u2019s agreeing a deal with resident doctors within weeks, securing a funding increase for GP practices to manage rising pressures or hiring an extra 1,000 GPs into the NHS by the end of this year, there are both short- and long-term reforms working hand in hand.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Streeting</strong> has posted a link to the online consultation page on social media.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/wesstreeting/status/1848247675763732681\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our NHS is broken, but not beaten.<br><br>We want your help to fix it.<br><br>Today the Prime Minister and I are launching the biggest consultation in NHS history!<br><br>Calling all patients, staff and partners - share your views and experiences for our 10 Year Plan \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb<a href=\"https://t.co/KO12G6CK4d\">https://t.co/KO12G6CK4d</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/YhB7XaXHLm\">pic.twitter.com/YhB7XaXHLm</a></p>&mdash; Wes Streeting MP (@wesstreeting) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesstreeting/status/1848247675763732681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Governments launch consultations for various reasons. Clearly, when ministers are making big changes to large, important institutions, it makes sense to find out first what the public think, and occasionally these exercise throw up ideas overlooked by the thinktank, policy-making world. But that is not the only, or even the main, function of these initiatives like this. Ensuring people <em>feel</em> consulted can be just as important as finding out what they think.</p> <p>More importantly, this is also about pitch-rolling \u2013 persuading people that an issue matters, and that change is needed. The public don\u2019t need to be told that the NHS needs rescuing; it is regularly at or near the top of problems that people say matter to them most, according to polling. But we are less than two weeks away from a budget that is set to raise the tax burden by a record amount in cash terms (not necessarily as a proportion of GDP) and it is very, very important for the government to convince people that this is happening for reason (like fixing the broken NHS) and not just out of profligacy. Gordon Brown was the master of this; when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/23/polls.conservatives\">put up national insurance to raise money for the NHS</a>, it turned out to be one of the most popular tax rises ever. Today\u2019s NHS consultation is probably more about budget framing than about a scramble for ideas to pad out next year\u2019s 10-year plan.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, are visiting a health centre in London to launch their public consultation on the NHS\u2019s future.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.20pm:</em> Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>After 3.30pm:</em> Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, opens the Commons debate on the second reading of the employment rights bill.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word.</p> <p>If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I\u2019m still using X and I\u2019ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian).</p> <p>I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct).

      "bodyText": "Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, has said the employment rights bill will be good for growth. Speaking during the opening of its second reading debate, she said an impact assessment published by the government today (see 3.48pm) made it clear the bill would have \u201ca positive impact on growth and more than 10 million workers will benefit from Labour\u2019s plan in every corner of this country\u201d. She went on: And the money in their pockets will go back into the economy and will support businesses, in particular, those on the high street. But many Tory MPs pointed out that the official analysis said the impact of the bill on growth was uncertain, and that even if there was a positive effect, it would be small. (See 4.41pm.) They also highlighted figures saying the cost to business could be close to \u00a35bn a year. Some NHS patients have received a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d due to delays within the health service, Wes Streeting has said, as Keir Starmer stressed the need for more use of AI and technology. Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting have launched a consultation on the future of the NHS. (See 9.13am.) In a post on social media, Streeting joked about some of the less serious responses already submitted. Thanks to @JackElsom for sending this idea for Wetherspoons in every hospital. Great idea, but sadly vetoed by the Chancellor during Budget negotiations. Thanks also to the person who suggested I be fired out of a cannon to raise money for the NHS. No Downing Street has said that Keir Starmer will not be offering reparations or an apology for Britain\u2019s role in slavery at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting this week. (See 12.56pm.) The Serious Fraud Office is investigating the construction of a hotel and conference centre owned by the Unite union, the BBC is reporting. A Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson has said that a party employee has resigned due to involvement in an incident where a DUP portrait was damaged at Belfast City Hall, PA Media reports. PA says: An investigation was launched after the official portrait of former DUP lord mayor Lord Browne of Belfast was damaged during an event at the weekend. A Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson said: \u201cToday, 21 October, a Sinn F\u00e9in employee, who works in the Assembly, made the party chief whip aware of their involvement in an incident regarding a portrait in Belfast City Hall which took place on Saturday 19th October. \u201cThe employee was immediately suspended, and we have notified the PSNI today. \u201cThe employee has now resigned from their employment and their party membership.\u201d Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has said that the government\u2019s anti-smoking bill will be \u201cmore ambitous\u201d than the version introduced by the Conservatives before the general election. Rishi Sunak\u2019s government published a tobacco and vapes bill that would have banned anyone born after 1 January 2009 from legally smoking by gradually raising the age at which tobacco can be bought. It did not become law because it ran out of time. Labour supported the Sunak bill, and in the king\u2019s speech it promised to revive it. But Streeting is now considering using it to ban smoking in some outdoor public spaces, like pub gardens. In an interview earlier today, Streeting said the bill will be published before Christmas. He went on: When the smoking bill is introduced, it will be more ambitious than the bill introduced by the previous government. Keir Starmer has declined to comment on King Charles being heckled in Canberra by an Indigenous Australian senator. In an interview earlier today, when he was asked if this was '\u201cdisgraceful\u201d, Starmer replied: Look, I think the King is doing a fantastic job, an incredible ambassador, not just for our country, but across the Commonwealth \u2026 and we should remember in the context of health, that he is out there doing his public service notwithstanding, you know, the health challenges he himself has had \u2013 so I think he\u2019s doing a great job. James Cleverly, the shadow home secretary, has claimed that that the decision to give Taylor Swift police protection for concerts in London will encourage foreign VIPs to demand the same treatment. Speaking during Home Office questions in the Commons, Cleverly said: Having been home secretary I have on numerous occasions had to deal with a request from foreign VIPs for a level of protection that they demanded or requested but that we did not feel was appropriate. Does [the minister] recognise the difficult position that she has put her own foreign secretary into when those future requests come in and they have to be denied? When those individuals will pray in aid the protection package put in place for a rockstar. Jess Phillips, the Home Office minister who was responding to the question, defended the Swift decision, saying that her concerts were \u201ccancelled in Vienna because of a terror threat that the CIA identified could harm tens of thousands of people\u201d. Cleverly also repeated Tory claims that the Metropolitan police gave Swift an escort only because of pressure from ministers, and that ministers got free concert tickets as a thank you. Ministers have rejected these claims, saying ultimately the Met had the final say over a police escort. Referring to the role Swift\u2019s mother was said to play in the negotiations with the Met and the government, Cleverly said: After the appalling results from recent negotiations with the BMA, the RMT and Mauritius, has [the minister] considered recruiting Taylor Swift\u2019s mum as a government negotiator? Phillips said she would like to see Swift\u2019s mum standing to be next Tory leader, because she would \u201creally offer something that is not currently available\u201d. At the afternoon Downing Street lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesperson defended the employment rights bill. Asked about figures showing it would increase direct costs for business (see 3.48pm), the spokesperson said: What this bill represents is an investment by businesses, by employers into their employees. For too long, poor productivity, insecure work and broken industrial relations have held back the economy. Last year we saw the highest number of working days lost to strikes since the 1980s, costing the economy billions of pounds. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, is opening the debate on the employment rights bill. She said the impact assessment published by the government today says the legislation will be good for growth. But, in an early intervention, the Conservative MP Graham Stuart said that document just said the measures might be good for growth. And, if there was a postive impact on growth, it would be small in magnitude according to the document, Stuart said. In the executive summary of its economic analysis, the government says: We conclude the package could have a direct and positive impact on economic growth, but we expect this to be small. And here is the more considered conclusion, from paragraphs 168 and 169. On balance, we believe the impact on growth could be positive (i.e. the positive channels above outweigh the offsetting effects) but the direct impact would be small in magnitude. This is because the package is well targeted at low-paying sectors meaning that many of the channels covered above are less applicable for a large part of the economy. In addition, the evidence between employment rights and growth in the UK is limited, but where we do have strong, policy-specific evidence it often indicates that the policy has had a negligible effect on growth. For example, the national living wage, which has imposed a similar magnitude of costs on a similar part of the labour market in recent years as we expect the bill to have, has had a limited impact on productivity and participation (and by extension growth) in either direction. It is right that there is evidence linking flexible working to stronger productivity and this change will boost productivity for some workers and some employers, but the increase in uptake of \u2018making flexible working the default\u2019 is relatively small compared to the number of people employed and therefore, at a macroeconomic level, the impact on average productivity will be small. Whilst we conclude that the direct impact would be small, it is likely that by boosting protections and the quality of work for the poorest in the labour market, the package will enhance lower-paid workers\u2019 share in the benefits of growth and boost equality in work. This is more than just good for equality; it could be good for the economy too as there is evidence that equality is important for \u2018sustainable\u2019 growth over the long-term. For example, the OECD note that higher inequality can lead to underinvestment in human capital and weaker adoption of technologies. They estimate that as a result of rising inequality between 1990 and 2010 output in the UK was almost nine percentage points lower than it could have otherwise been. As a result, by increasing the security, quality and equality of work, it\u2019s possible that the bill could also indirectly support the government\u2019s mission to grow the economy beyond a small direct impact, helping to raise living standards across the country. Suella Braverman forwarded government documents to her private email accounts on at least 127 occasions when she was attorney general, according to a story by George Greenwood at the Times. The Attorney General\u2019s Office disclosed the figure after a lengthy Freedom of Information battle culminated in a tribunal finding against the government. Braverman, who became home secretary after serving as attorney general but who was sacked from the Home Office for sending a government document from her personal email address, did not respond to a request from the Times for comment. Greenwood said that sending documents to her personal email address when she was attorney general may have been a breach of the ministerial code. He says: A Freedom of Information request submitted by The Times has now revealed that [Braverman] was forwarding such correspondence routinely while serving as the government\u2019s top legal officer between 2021 and 2022. The 127 emails had at least 290 documents attached. Ministers are banned from sharing sensitive emails and documents about government business with their private accounts because weak security provisions put them at greater risk of unauthorised access. It is not known whether Braverman forwarded sensitive or official documents to her personal account. The Attorney General\u2019s Office (AGO) did not respond to a request for comment. Commenting on the economic analysis of the employment rights bill published by the government today (see 3.48pm), Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said: Despite repeated attempts to paint this bill as bad for business, this rigorous impact assessment shows that the business costs are negligible and are more than offset by the wider economic and social gains. These changes will mostly affect those companies whose business models have been built on low-paid, insecure employment. Decent employers will welcome these measures and the improvements they will bring for their businesses and workforces. The Department for Business and Trade has said the benefits of the employment rights bill will justify the costs it will impose on business amounting to nearly \u00a35bn per year. It has set out this assessment in an economic analysis of the bill, published alongside 24 regulatory impact assessment setting out the direct costs of the measures included in the legislation. The bill, which is getting its second reading in the Commons this afternoon, has been described as \u201cthe biggest overhaul of workers rights in generations\u201d. It will significantly strengthen workers\u2019 rights. In its economic analysis, the government says that some of these new regulations will impose new costs on business. We expect the policies covered within the bill to impose a direct cost on business equivalent to low billion pounds per year. If we take the top-end of the range from our broad order of magnitude cost to business estimates in tables A3, A4, and A5 to get the maximum likely cost this sum to \u00a34.5bn [sic]. As such, we are confident that the total direct cost to business will be less than \u00a35bn annually. This represents a cautious assessment, and we expect the total cost to business to be refined downwards as our evidence improves and the policy development continues Nevertheless, to contextualise the size of this impact, total wage costs in the UK were \u00a31.3 trillion in 2023 in nominal terms, meaning that an annual cost of up to \u00a35bn is equivalent to an uplift of the UK\u2019s total pay bill of up to 0.4%. This cost will be concentrated on employers in lower paid sectors, but even if we assumed all of this cost falls on such sectors, then hypothetically the equivalent uplift in the wage bill for that part of the economy would be up to 1.5%. The report says the empirical evidence about who would pay the cost of stronger employment protections is \u201cambiguous\u201d. It says firms might pass on higher costs to customers. If they cannot do that, they might cut investment or training costs, or cut employment costs, it says. But the report says giving workers more rights will cut the number of days lost to stress, depression and anxiety, which it implies will more or less compensate for the increase in direct costs. It says: There will be further benefits for those in work from better job satisfaction, as well as improved wellbeing and health, which could be amount to billions of pounds a year. This will benefit their employers too as 17.1 million working days were lost due to stress, depression or anxiety in 2022/233 , equivalent to over \u00a35bn of lost output. And the report says, overall, the impact of the bill will be positive. There are clear, evidence-based benefits of government action through the bill. Not acting would enable poor working conditions, insecure work, inequalities and broken industrial relations to persist. The bill will strengthen working conditions for the lowest-paid and most vulnerable in the labour market, increasing fairness and equality across Britain. It will have significant positive impacts on workers who are trapped in insecure work, face discrimination, or suffer from unscrupulous employer behaviour like \u2018fire and refire\u2019 practices. [See 2.52pm.] Many policy changes in the bill will target the issues identified by the independent Taylor review of modern working practices. Workers in adult social care, those covered by collective bargaining agreements, those grieving a loss of a loved family member, and those struggling to make work fit in around other commitments will also be notable beneficiaries \u2026 The package will be significantly positive for society (i.e., the benefits will outweigh the costs) if policy implementation is well-targeted, and the risks of unintended consequences are mitigated through consultation and policy design. We intend to refine this assessment as policy development continues. Inspectors have raised serious concerns about the care provided to child asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on small boats, including babies who have had their fingerprints scanned and lone children left to sleep on mats on the floor. A report published today by HM Inspectorate of Prisons on short-term holding facilities in Kent, including Manston, Western Jet Foil and two Kent Intake Units, found that overall there had been improvements and improved management of new arrivals. However serious concerns are flagged about the welfare of the new arrivals, especially children. Detainees are given wrist tags with QR codes and fingerprints are repeatedly scanned including babies. The Home Office did not always keep correct records of the length of time people were detained, with one person held for 106 hours incorrectly recorded as detained for 51 hours. New arrivals are supposed to be held for a maximum of 24 hours. One ten year-old Afghan boy asked for a phone so he could call his mum but was told that would not be possible while a 15-year-old girl who said she had been sold to traffickers was interviewed without an appropriate adult. Some Border Force staff and cleaners working on the frontline had not been DBS checked and one contractor was sacked for aggressively pulling a sleeping child to their feet and making disparaging comments to them. There were examples of children being woken up at night to be interviewed with one child interviewed at 1.20am. Inspectors said that at Kent Intake Unit in Dover some of the lone child arrivals were very young \u2018and had obviously been fitted on arrival with wrist tags with QR codes\u201d. Here is our latest Politics Weekly podcast. It features Pippa Crerar and Kiran Stacey talking about the NHS consultation, and about next week\u2019s budget. Workers in some of the lowest-paid and most insecure jobs could gain an extra \u00a3600 a year from the measures in the employment rights bill being debated later, the government claims. In a news release, the Department for Business and Trade says: Poor productivity, insecure work, and broken industrial relations have been holding back the British economy for too long. Last year the country saw the highest number of working days lost to strikes since the 1980s \u2013 costing the economy millions of pounds. This has entrenched a culture of brinkmanship that only serves to damage public services, public finances, and public faith in institutions. Today is a significant step in putting an end to that \u2013 as the Employment Rights Bill reaches its second reading, alongside a package of consultations to help inform its next steps. This includes a consultation on our new approach to Statutory Sick Pay, where the Bill will be removing the waiting period and the Lower Earnings Limit. The Bill is expected to benefit people in some of the most deprived areas of the country by saving them up to \u00a3600 in lost income from the hidden costs of insecure work. Around 2.4 million people in the UK work irregular patterns like zero or low hours contracts or agency jobs, where insecure hours can mean forking out on expensive childcare or transport to cover last-minute shifts - or losing out altogether if work is changed or cancelled at short notice. New protections like guaranteed hours and giving reasonable notice or compensation for lost work will help shift workers keep up to \u00a3600 a year, including workers in the North and Midlands where irregular work is highest. For a cleaner working night shifts on an average annual wage of \u00a321,058, a \u00a3600 saving would be worth over \u00a3250 more a year than the last two national insurance cuts. MPs will debate the second reading of the employment rights bill later this afternoon. To coincide with the debate, the Department for Business and Trade has published more than 20 impact assessments relating to the bill. I will post more on what they say shortly. A \u201cmaximum BMI for nurses\u201d and an \u201cNHS TV channel\u201d are just some of the suggestions put forward as officials launched a national consultation on the future of the health service, PA Media reports. PA says: Hundreds of suggestions were put forward in the hours after the consultation was officially launched by ministers on Monday. Billed as \u201cthe biggest national conversation about the future of the NHS since its birth\u201d, members of the public will be able to share their views online via change.NHS.uk until the start of next year. Topics of conversation include streamlining management, providing better pay for NHS workers, improving access to dentistry and social care, among others. One contributor called for an NHS TV channel \u201cfor patients to access physiotherapy exercise sessions for various conditions\u201d. Another called for free parking in hospitals while others suggested that the service should prescribe gym memberships to help tackle the nation\u2019s obesity crisis. Some of the suggestions need to be taken with a pinch of salt, such as one contributor calling for all doctors to be given \u201cDoctor Who\u201d name badges. One contributor called for free cinema tickets \u201con the NHS\u201d. Another said that staff \u201cshould lead by example\u201d as they said that the NHS should introduce a maximum BMI score for nurses. There are other examples of joke responses at 1.29pm. In an interview with Sky News, NHS England\u2019s national medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis defended the consultation exercise. Asked about previous public engagement activities, such as the public poll which saw Boaty McBoatface emerge as the winning choice for the naming of a polar research ship (it was vetoed and named RRS Sir David Attenborough instead), Powis said: I\u2019m really confident that patients and staff often have the solutions to problems. I visit many, many health organisations, whether it\u2019s in general practice or in hospitals, every week and I\u2019m always struck that staff and patients have ideas, they have great ideas. Our job is to capture them, to test them, and where they work, to ensure that we roll them out as quickly as possible. So I\u2019m very confident that there will be a lot of great ideas coming out of this listening exercise. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson was asked about the plan for digital \u201cpatient passports\u201d, and what would be done to stop random NHS employees being able to read the records. Stephen Kinnock, the care minister, came under pressure when asked about this on the Today programme. (See 9.43am.) Asked about the same issue, the spokesperson said: The data bill will introduce strong security protocols to protect data, and all NHS organisations have got strong governance arrangements in place. But what this data bill will also do is transform patients\u2019 experience, and that is obviously putting patients at the heart of our reforms. But the spokesperson also said that any data shared with organisations outside the NHS for medical research purposes would be anonymised. There would also be security protocols too, he said. He went on: But we do think that there is significant opportunity in this space, within those parameters and with those strict controls, to drive research and game-changing innovations that will ultimately be a benefit to patients in the NHS. Some journalists have been monitoring responses to the NHS consultation launched by Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting this morning, and they\u2019re noting that not everyone is engaging seriously. From the Times\u2019s Chris Smyth From Katy Balls at the Spectator From Christian Calgie at the Express And these are from James Ball from the New European I\u2019d imagine somewhere in the Department of Health there is a civil servant currently feeling *extremely* vindicated over their attempt to explain why consultation responses aren\u2019t usually just immediately made public. (Among the many reasons is that they\u2019re extremely game-able by pressure groups, who think flooding them with similar responses is in any way useful, etc) At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesperson was also asked if Keir Starmer agreed that Britain was historically guilty of genocide in Australia, as an Indigenous Australian senator said when she hecked King Charles at Parliament House in Canberra. Lidia Thorpe told Charles: You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us \u2013 our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. Asked if Britain was guilty of genocide in Australia, the spokesperson said he would not be drawn on comments made in relation to royal matters. But he said Britain\u2019s relationship with Australia was \u201cfantastic\u201d and that it was a key ally. As Eleni Courea reports, Keir Starmer is under pressure from Labour MPs and Caribbean governments to open the door to reparatory justice when he travels to Samoa this week. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said the government remained opposed to the idea of paying reparations for Britain\u2019s historic role in the slave trade. The spokesperson also said there would be no apology at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) this week. He said: Reparations are not on the agenda for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. The government\u2019s position on this has not changed, we do not pay reparations. The prime minister\u2019s attending this week\u2019s summit to discuss shared challenges and opportunities faced by the Commonwealth including driving growth across our economies. Asked about an apology, the spokesperson said: The position on apology remains the same. We won\u2019t be offering an apology at Chogm, but we will continue to engage with partners on the issues as we work with them to tackle the pressing challenges of today and indeed for the future generations. Most voters will back a rise in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions if the money goes towards the NHS, according to polling commissioned by a Labour thinktank. The YouGov polling suggests that, when people are just asked if they approve or disapprove of a rise in employers\u2019 NICs, they disapprove by 40% to 30%. But when people are asked if they would approve this tax going up to fund healthcare and the NHS, they are in favour by 69% to 18%. People who voted Labour at the election are even more supportive, with 85% of them approving of the idea, the polling suggests. And people who voted Labour in the 2024 election having voted Conservative in 2019 are also 82% in favour. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has strongly hinted that employers\u2019 NICs will go up in the budget. She has said that this tax was not covered by the Labour manifesto promise not to put up national insurance generally. The polling was commissioned by Labour Together, a thintank and campaign group partly set up by Morgan McSweeney, who is now Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff. It is focused on prompting policies that will help the party to carry on winning elections. YouGov also explored what other reasons might make people support a rise in employers\u2019 NICs. Extra money for health was by far the most powerful motivator, but people would also back employers\u2019 NICs going up if told the money would be used for education, for tax cuts or for the police. But if told the money was going on defence, on cutting the national debt or on giving public sectors a pay rise, they were not in favour. Matt Upton, director of policy at Labour Together, said: Time and time again in polls and focus groups, voters across the country have told us that Labour must deliver on their key priorities: the NHS and cost of living. If it doesn\u2019t, it faces prompt dismissal at the next election. This polling shows that voters are overwhelmingly willing to back a potential tax rise like this on business, if the money is spent on the things they care most about. Crucially for Labour strategists, support for this is even higher among those who switched from the Tories in 2019 to Labour in 2024. This group, though small in number, were decisive at this election and will be again at the next one if Labour is to win a second term. Robert Jenrick, the Tory leadership candidate, has called for manadory life sentences for members of grooming gangs. In an interview with GB News, he said: The public want action now. They are sick of this. This is a moral stain on our country, that thousands of children have been abused in this way and public officials have turned a blind eye to it. What we need is action now to try to eliminate this, because only a fool would believe this isn\u2019t happening today on our streets somewhere in our country. What I want to see are mandatory life sentences for these despicable predators, so that you\u2019re not out in 14 years, as the current law suggests, or less, but actually you\u2019re never out of prison again. I want those of these predators who are not British citizens to be removed from our country with compulsory deportations, and the public officials who turn a blind eye for fear of racism or community relations, I want them to be prosecuted and barred from working in the public sector ever again. A former council chief executive who had to apologise for attacking monarchists as bigots and xenophobes has been appointed the Scottish National party\u2019s acting chief executive. Carol Beattie, the former chief executive at Stirling council, was given the post by the SNP national executive on Saturday less than a day after Murray Foote, suddenly quit as the party\u2019s chief executive. Beattie sparked controversy after criticising an article about Kate Middleton\u2019s return to public duties following her cancer diagnosis by claiming \u201cintelligent people don\u2019t support the monarchy\u201d. Those that do, she added, \u201cuse them as symbols of their bigotry or xenophobic values\u201d. Her tweets emerged last month after Beattie stood as the SNP\u2019s candidate for a byelection in Falkirk, which was held last week, only six months after she stood down as Stirling council\u2019s lead official. The SNP has consistently stayed clear of republicanism, to avoid alienating pro-monarchy votes. She said: \u201cI apologise for any offence caused by the language I used and have removed the tweets.\u201d Keith Brown, the SNP\u2019s deputy leader, said: She brings considerable experience to the role and her appointment will continue the work, under John Swinney\u2019s leadership, to ensure a professional, modern, dynamic election-winning organisation. The SNP remains the dominant political force in Scotland, and Carol Beattie\u2019s appointment will ensure we remain equipped for the tasks ahead. Beattie narrowly lost the Falkirk South byelection to Labour\u2019s Claire Aitken last Thursday. It had been called after the incumbent, Euan Stainbank, was elected as a Labour MP in July \u2013 the party\u2019s youngest Scottish MP at 24. Scotland uses proportional voting in council elections. In a signal that Labour support is being hit by the winter fuel payment cuts and the controversies over Keir Starmer\u2019s clothes and glasses donations, Beattie gained the most votes in the first round of voting, 1,043 \u2013 29 votes more than Aitken. Aitken took the seat in the seventh round of voting. Craig Hoy, the Scottish Conservative chair, said: The murky appointment of Carol Beattie highlights the level of chaos unfolding within the scandal-ridden SNP. Despite saying he would stay on until a permanent replacement was found, Murray Foote obviously couldn\u2019t leave fast enough from the turmoil of the SNP. In the past the weirdest budget tradition was the convention that the chancellor is allowed to drink alcohol while delivering the budget speech. But since no chancellor has taken advantage of the rule since the 1990s (and no one expects Rachel Reeves to be quaffing on Wednesday week), this tradition is probably best viewed as lapsed. But Sam Coates from Sky News has discovered another weird budget ritual. On his Politics at Jack and Sam\u2019s podcast, he says: Someone messaged me to say: \u2018Did you know that over in the Treasury as they\u2019ve been going over all these spending settlements, in one of the offices, its full of balloons. And every time an individual department finalises its settlements, one of the balloons is popped.\u2019 Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has revived claims that some patients are receiving a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d because of the problems with the NHS. Speaking at a health centre in east London, where he was launching the consultation on the future of the NHS (see 9.13am) alongside Keir Starmer, Streeting said: There couldn\u2019t be a more important time for us to have this conversation. The NHS is going through what is objectively the worst crisis in its history, whether it\u2019s people struggling to get access to their GP, dialling 999 and an ambulance not arriving in time, turning up to A&amp;E departments and waiting far too long, sometimes on trolleys in corridors, or going through the ordeal of knowing that you\u2019re waiting for a diagnosis that could be the difference between life and death. Worse still, receiving a prognosis that amounts to a death sentence that could have been avoided because the NHS didn\u2019t reach you in time. That is, I\u2019m afraid, the daily reality in the NHS today. Streeting also said the consultation was important because the best ideas for NHS reform would not come from Whitehall. He said: We feel really strongly that the best ideas aren\u2019t going to come from politicians in Whitehall. They\u2019re going to come from staff working right across the country and, crucially, patients, because our experiences as patients are also really important to understanding what the future of the NHS needs to be and what it could be with the right ideas. Streeting has used the term \u201cdeath sentence\u201d before in relation to patients\u2019 experience of the NHS (normally in relation to cancer, because some cancer survival rates are worse than in comparable countries). It has been reported that some NHS leaders don\u2019t like this language because they worry it will deter patients and undermine staff morale. But in his speeech to Labour\u2019s conference Streeting doubled down, claiming it was important to tell the truth because otherwise he would be \u201ckilling [the NHS] with kindness\u201d. Robert Jenrick, who is seen as the underdog behind Kemi Badenoch in the Tory leadership contest, has said that if he wins, Conservative candidiates at the next election will have to support his plan for Britain to leave the European convention on human rights. In an interview on Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour last night, he said: If we were lucky enough to win the next general election, then this would be part of our manifesto. So yes, it would be Conservative party policy, and those choosing to stand at the election would have to support it, as they do any other important policy that\u2019s part of the manifesto. Jenrick has already said Tory MPs would have to back the policy if they wanted to take a post in his shadow cabinet. Requiring candidates at the next election to declare in favour of ECHR withdrawal goes even further, and would probably be a step too far for some current Conservative MPs. In his Westminster Hour interview, Jenrick also criticised Badenoch\u2019s decision not to announce policy plans at this point. Badenoch says that there is no point announcing policy so far ahead of the next general election, and that it is more important for the party to decide its values and principles. (This has not stopped her saying she would reverse Labour\u2019s imposition of VAT on private school fees.) Commenting on Badenoch\u2019s approach, Jenrick said: I think it\u2019s disrespectful to the members and the public to ask for their votes without saying where you stand on the big issues facing our country today. A plan today is what I offer. A promise of a plan at some point in the future is what my opponent offers, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to rebuild the public\u2019s trust and confidence in us. Keir Starmer has defended plans to digitalise records in the NHS. Speaking at an event in east London to launch the consultation on the future of the NHS (see 9.13am), he said: There are some obvious things that I think we do need to do. We need to go from analogue to digital, we need to use much better technology, whether that is in the ambulance service, in our hospitals, in our neighbourhoods, making much more use of technology. He also said NHS workers had a \u201conce-in-a-generation opportunity\u201d to reshape the service for the future. Addressing claims that the government should be starting NHS reform now, instead of consulting, Starmer told health staff: We want to hear from you and from as wide a number of people as possible, both in the NHS and people who are using the NHS, because this needs to be the once-in-a-generation opportunity for you to put your fingerprints on the future \u2013 literally to craft the service that you are working for. This is a really important conversation to create that NHS of the future, a moment in our history. Andy Street, the Conservative former West Midlands mayor, has hinted that he may decline to vote for either of the two candidates left in the Tory leadership contest. Kemi Badenoch, who is seen as the favourite, and Robert Jenrick are both now firmly on the right of the party. Street, who was West Midlands mayor for seven years until he was narrowly defeated by Labour in May, is on the opposite wing of the party, and is seen as a \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201ccentrist\u201d. In an interview on the Today programme, asked if he would say who he was backing in the leadership contest, Street replied: I\u2019ve got my ballot paper. But you\u2019re not going to get me to do that, I\u2019m afraid. I was clear before the previous two rounds that I wanted a candidate from the centre, the moderate part of the party. I backed Tom Tugendhat publicly. I\u2019m not going to back anyone publicly now. Asked if he would be backing either of the two candidates privately (ie, voting for one of them), Street replied: I will decide that myself. The answer to that is private. Asked if he thought either Badenoch or Jenrick could represent the future of the party, he replied: \u201cMaybe.\u201d If Street does boycott the contest, he won\u2019t be alone. As Jessica Elgot reported last week, polling suggests 15% of Conservative councillors won\u2019t vote in the contest because they do not like the choice on offer. Here are social media posts from two journalists about the plan for digital \u201cpatient passports\u201d in the NHS. From John Burn-Murdoch, the Financial Times\u2019 chief data reporter Everyone saying \u201cno we can\u2019t let the NHS use a proper joined up digital patient database, it\u2019s all part of a plot to privatise British healthcare and sell your data\u201d should be forced to read the dozens (hundreds?) of case studies like these From Jim Waterson, the former Guardian journalist who now writes the London Centric newsletter on Substack I hate doing personal posts but: When my mum was dying last year, NHS data sharing failures and prioritising GDPR over pain relief repeatedly left her in agony. In desperation I began to build a Google Doc of her records linked to a QR code for doctors to scan. System\u2019s broken. Claims that Nicola Sturgeon has been banned from attending Alex Salmond\u2019s memorial service have been rejected as \u201cpremature\u201d by Kenny MacAskill, the acting leader of Alba, the former first minister\u2019s nationalist party. The Sunday Mail reported at the weekend an Alba source saying there was \u201cnot a chance in hell\u201d that Sturgeon would be invited, given the pair\u2019s incendiary split over the allegations of sexual misconduct against Salmond. Sturgeon and Salmond have not spoken since the allegations emerged following a Scottish government inquiry in 2018. Salmond had repeatedly accused her aides of orchestrating a smear campaign against him \u2013 claims Sturgeon has consistently dismissed. In a statement rejecting the Sunday Mail\u2019s claims, MacAskill said: Now is the time for Alex\u2019s family to be given the privacy and time to grieve the loss of a beloved husband, brother and uncle. An announcement will be made in the coming days about arrangements for a private funeral to be attended by his family and close friends. There will be time in the coming weeks to celebrate his life and commemorate his achievements in a memorial service, the family have yet to make any arrangements for that. All other speculation is premature. Salmond\u2019s family are expecting to hold a private funeral for the former first minister in his home village of Strichen, Aberdeenshire, next week, where he will also be buried. No date has yet been fixed for a memorial service, though some allies have suggested St Andrew\u2019s Day on 30 November. It remains unclear whether Sturgeon would expect to be invited. Salmond told a BBC Scotland documentary which aired last month: \u201cIt\u2019s a big regret that Nicola and I are no longer on speaking terms and I seriously doubt if it\u2019s going to improve.\u201d Stephen Kinnock, the care minister, was giving interviews this morning on behalf of the government. He was promoting the consultation on the future of the NHS, but many of the questions he took were about the government\u2019s plans for a digital \u201cpatient passport\u201d, ensuring people\u2019s medical records are all available in one place, through the NHS app. Pippa Crerar and Denis Campbell explain that here. Kinnock sought to play down concerns that people\u2019s data would be at risk. But, in an interview with Mishal Husain on the Today programme, he was could not give her firm assurances on this point. When Husain asked if people\u2019s patient records would be available to all 1.5 million NHS employees under the government\u2019s plans, Kinnock said the protocols would be set out in the forthcoming data bill. He went on: We\u2019re absolutely committed to protecting data, and we need the cyber security in place. Of course, one of the problems is the NHS uses Excel XP which is not conducive to the most modern cyber security techniques. We\u2019ve got to modernize the tech. Husain said protecting data from cyber attacks was a diferent matter, and she again asked if all NHS employees would be able to access someone\u2019s medical records. Kinnock replied: What we\u2019re proposing is no different to online banking apps. So this is definitely more NatWest than it is Star Trek. This is a system that is going to be based on common sense, on enabling a single patient record. In the end, if we don\u2019t modernise the NHS, make it more efficient and productive, you can have the best data protection rules in the world, but you not going to have a health and care system that actually works. Husain tried twice more to get a clear answer about the restrictions on NHS staff accessing individuals\u2019 records. Kinnock did not say in detail how the system would work, but he said ultimately it was a matter of balance. You\u2019ve got to have a system that works and that enables the hugely important interface between GPS, hospitals and patients, and to create that single patient record. That has to be balanced against water tight data protection, and that is the balance that we\u2019re going to strike. But if you constantly just say, we can\u2019t do this because of data protection concerns, you\u2019re just going to have the status quo going on and on and on, and you\u2019re going to have a system that doesn\u2019t work. Michael Gove has said that the most hurtful part of his political career was the attacks on his former wife, Sarah Vine, Peter Walker reports. Good morning. When the Labour government came into power, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, declared on his first day in office \u201cthe policy of this department is that the NHS is broken\u201d. The government is going to publish a 10-year health plan to fix it, and it is due to be published next spring. Streeting has said the plan will involve three main elements: moving from analogue to digital; more focus on primary care, not hospital care; and more focus on prevention. Keir Starmer explained them in a speech on the NHS in September. But today the government is asking people who work in the NHS and use it \u2013 the \u201centire nation\u201d, as the Department of Health and Social Care puts it in its news release \u2013 to contribute to a consultation how health service should change. The DHSC explains: Members of the public, as well as NHS staff and experts will be invited to share their experiences views and ideas for fixing the NHS via the online platform, change.nhs.uk, which will be live until the start of next year, and available via the NHS App. The public engagement exercise will help shape the government\u2019s 10 Year Health Plan which will be published in spring 2025 and will be underlined by three big shifts in healthcare - hospital to community, analogue to digital, and sickness to prevention \u2026 Bold ambitions for the NHS can only be achieved by listening to the expertise and knowledge of its 1.54 million strong workforce. Their understanding of what\u2019s holding them back from performing at their best will help us bring down waiting times and provide the world class care the public deserve. The government has already taken immediate action to address challenges in the health service and deliver an NHS fit for the future. Whether that\u2019s agreeing a deal with resident doctors within weeks, securing a funding increase for GP practices to manage rising pressures or hiring an extra 1,000 GPs into the NHS by the end of this year, there are both short- and long-term reforms working hand in hand. Streeting has posted a link to the online consultation page on social media. Governments launch consultations for various reasons. Clearly, when ministers are making big changes to large, important institutions, it makes sense to find out first what the public think, and occasionally these exercise throw up ideas overlooked by the thinktank, policy-making world. But that is not the only, or even the main, function of these initiatives like this. Ensuring people feel consulted can be just as important as finding out what they think. More importantly, this is also about pitch-rolling \u2013 persuading people that an issue matters, and that change is needed. The public don\u2019t need to be told that the NHS needs rescuing; it is regularly at or near the top of problems that people say matter to them most, according to polling. But we are less than two weeks away from a budget that is set to raise the tax burden by a record amount in cash terms (not necessarily as a proportion of GDP) and it is very, very important for the government to convince people that this is happening for reason (like fixing the broken NHS) and not just out of profligacy. Gordon Brown was the master of this; when he put up national insurance to raise money for the NHS, it turned out to be one of the most popular tax rises ever. Today\u2019s NHS consultation is probably more about budget framing than about a scramble for ideas to pad out next year\u2019s 10-year plan. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, are visiting a health centre in London to launch their public consultation on the NHS\u2019s future. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.20pm: Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, opens the Commons debate on the second reading of the employment rights bill.

      "body": "<p>Ferenc Puskas played pregnant, teammate Amancio Amaro liked to say. The day he arrived at Real Madrid in 1958, he was 31 years old, 18kg overweight and, banned by Fifa for defecting after the Hungarian uprising, hadn\u2019t played football for two years. He couldn\u2019t possibly go on a pitch like this: signing me is all well and good, he told the club\u2019s president Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, but have you <em>seen</em> me? \u201cI was the size of a large balloon,\u201d he recalled and the coach, Luis Carniglia, didn\u2019t know what to do with him either. That, Bernab\u00e9u replied, was their problem not his. As it turned out, blessed with a left foot like no other, 242 goals followed, the only problem that he hadn\u2019t come sooner.</p> \n<p>Most called him <em>Ca\u00f1oncito pum!</em> (Little Cannon Bang!), although Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano called him little cannon big belly. That summer Puskas trained wrapped in plastic and woolly jumpers. By the season\u2019s end, he had scored the goal that took Real Madrid to the European Cup final; a year on, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/18/real-madrid-eintracht-frankfurt-60-years-european-cup-hampden\">scored four in the final</a> but gave Erwin Stein the match ball. Old when he came, supposedly finished, he helped Madrid reach three more. He scored a hat-trick in 1962 and played in 1964 but when the 1966 final arrived, eight years after he had, it was over. Left behind while they travelled to Brussels, he was in a makeshift cup team facing Betis three days before and 1,000 miles south.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/oct/21/bayern-munich-get-back-in-groove-as-kane-and-kompany-trust-the-process\">Bayern Munich get back in groove as Kane and Kompany trust the process | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was 8 May 1966 and it was Puskas\u2019s last game. He was 39 years and 36 days old. No one older had played for Madrid until this Saturday when, an hour into their visit to Vigo, Carlo Ancelotti called over Luka Modric. His mission: to do what he does, what he had done so often, and take control. Williot Swedberg had scored an equaliser to make it 1-1, leaping over the advertising boards and into the arms of the ballboys, <a href=\"https://x.com/tsf_podcast/status/1847733249860313573\">Balaidos going wild</a>, and Celta were everywhere. Madrid were overwhelmed. But then Modric stepped into the fray. One hundred and 53 seconds later, Madrid led again and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior was running towards the corner, pointing back at the old man, saying: \u201cWhat a pass, what a pass!\u201d</p> \n<p>This wasn\u2019t done yet \u2013 Celta were superb again and deserved more \u2013 but ultimately another match had been taken back. \u201cCelta play, Madrid win,\u201d AS\u2019s headline read. A few flashes had been enough, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s right foot providing a belting opener, Thibaut Courtois\u2019 left making two superb saves and Vin\u00edcius\u2019s finish delivering a winner, supplied by Modric, who was handed a Madrid shirt after the game with 250 on the back, one for each win he now has with them when it really should have said 39 40, <em>years and days</em>. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t fit or perhaps they were worried about annoying him. \u201cI don\u2019t like being reminded of my age,\u201d he said afterwards, \u201cbut it\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Necessary too, Marca\u2019s headline calling him \u201cthe eternal solution\u201d. There is a reason Luka Modric is still around and it\u2019s not nostalgia, not the fact that the player who wasn\u2019t a guaranteed starter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/29/real-madrid-luka-modric-position\">when he joined</a> 12 years ago became the best midfielder to ever play for the biggest club of them all. Not the 547 games played or the 27 trophies won, even if that is more than anyone. It\u2019s not the Vicente Calder\u00f3n\u2019s last night in Europe, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/11/atletico-madrid-real-madrid-vincente-calderon\">calmly guided them through a biblical storm</a>, an exhibition of superiority and supranatural serenity, that could be titled <em>leave it to me</em>; not the delivery for <em>la</em> <em>d</em><em>\u00e9cima</em>; not <em>that</em> ridiculous pass to Rodrygo against Manchester City, or the one against PSG you can\u2019t even see if you pause the video <em><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37626245/luka-modric-real-madrid-most-important-player-even-36-just-ask-psg\">at exactly</a></em><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37626245/luka-modric-real-madrid-most-important-player-even-36-just-ask-psg\"> the right point</a>. It\u2019s not the moments or the music, joy in how he played, the outside of his boot, a magician\u2019s wand, or the unique, understated simplicity of it all, although all that is there and always will be. It\u2019s something simpler: he\u2019s still got it.</p> \n<p>There have been times when there didn\u2019t seem to be long left \u2013 how could there not be closing in on 40? \u2013 and moments when it might have gone some other way, when Modric might have done too. In 2018, he had negotiated with Inter. A World Cup finalist, he had just won a third Champions League in a row and was about to claim the Ballon d\u2019Or. After six years in Madrid, about to turn 33, it was time, he thought; it\u2019s not an idea he has wanted to entertain since. Madrid blocked that move, insisting he would only go if someone paid his \u20ac750m buyout clause, and six years later the man who is on annual contracts, every extension earned one by one, and who Rodrygo calls dad, only a year younger than his actual father, is still rightfully around.</p> \n<p>That requires a talent that sets him apart and a temperament that does too, an enthusiasm for the game and a determination that goes with it. This isn\u2019t the football Puskas played. Modric is a tough little bastard with calves like cannon balls, a face that is sharp and worn, not an ounce of fat on him, a glimpse of his attitude <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/09/luka-modric-things-that-arent-nice-happen-in-war-but-i-dont-have-hate-croatia-real-madrid-child\">as well as his art</a>. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to have done this and to continue at the best club in the world,\u201d he said on Saturday, and that pride is part of it. \u201cHe is an extraordinary professional who has character,\u201d Ancelotti said, and he knows; this isn\u2019t someone who welcomes the chance to sit it out for a few minutes, still less allow others to tell him when it\u2019s time to leave, and managing that has not always been easy.</p> \n<p>Transitions were left incomplete, the predicted decline postponed, any withdrawal put on hold. MLS was an idea floated for a while, not sure that an extension would be offered at the Bernab\u00e9u, but which was packed away again, his determination to fight only strengthened. Martin \u00d8degaard returned early from a two-year loan at Real Sociedad, a pathway opened for him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/27/arsenal-can-martin-odegaard-make-up-for-lost-time-real-madrid-real-sociedad-loan\">but Modric closed it</a>. The third-fourth playoff at the last World Cup was worth going to if only because surely it was going to be his last, only it wasn\u2019t: last week he played twice for Croatia, taking his caps to 182. Ivan Rakitic went; Modric went on. \u201cHe is a lesson for us all,\u201d his countryman said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"54cab7a1-9b69-4f94-a5a2-4fa2c6e929fc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Alav\u00e9s 2-3 Valladolid, Athletic Bilbao 4-1 Espanyol, Osasuna 1-2 Real Betis, Girona 0-1 Real Sociedad, Celta Vigo 1-2 Real Madrid, Mallorca 1-0 Rayo Vallecano, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 3-1 Legan\u00e9s, Villarreal 1-1 Getafe, Barcelona 5-1 Sevilla</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Monday:</b> Valencia v Las Palmas</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After Manchester City beat Madrid 4-0 in the Champions League semi-final in May 2023, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/18/hammering-at-manchester-city-may-prompt-a-rebuild-at-real-madrid\">it seemed it was goodbye</a>. The year before, as they won the most miraculous title <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/37629037/destiny-magic-miracle-real-madrid-won-champions-league-hard-way\">of them all</a>, there had had been a glimpse of the transition already coming, captured in part in a gorgeous photo of Modric and Kroos, two men who had done it all sitting on a bench, spent, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37637249/modric-kroos-real-madrid-ageless-wonders\">watching the kids play</a>. \u201cI have had to ask the younger players for patience and the older players for understanding,\u201d Ancelotti said. He knew it wasn\u2019t easy but defeat at the Etihad meant accelerating that generational change, ushering in a new era, a new style: a shift to something more dynamic, more \u201cmodern\u201d.</p> \n<p>Except that an eternal, universal truth got in the way: the ball. Ancelotti soon modified his athletic approach in search of control. He would need his veterans after all, although he decided that one would be enough. Thirty-eight and withdrawn at half-time in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/sep/25/alvaro-morata-madrid-derby-atletico-la-liga\">last September\u2019s derby,</a> Modric didn\u2019t play the next two league games and it was more often Kroos, the last season of his life also the best, that would provide the timing, the vision, the authority that Ancelotti sought. From nine Champions League starts the year before, Modric made just three last season. He wasn\u2019t happy and at times it showed, but there was still a role \u2013 eight European games as a sub, 32 league matches, 18 as a starter \u2013 and it seemed that every time he came on, Madrid got better. A season that seemed likely to be his last, right up to the final days when fans sang for him to stay, offered the perfect end with his <em>sixth</em> European Cup. No one has won more, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/article/2024/jun/02/real-madrid-di-stefano-greatest-team-ever-european-cup\">not even Puskas</a>.</p> \n<p>Instead, it was Kroos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/22/irreplaceable-toni-kroos-walks-away-early-at-the-top-a-mic-drop-moment\">who walked away at 34</a>, five years younger, the timing as impeccable as ever. For him, anyway. And, it turned out, for Modric too, any doubts about his continuity that Madrid might have had swept away, which is what he had wanted, whatever it cost. \u201cLuka and I have different views on how to end our careers,\u201d Kroos said. \u201cI always wanted to end on a great moment, with my body still working well.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI feel good mentally and physically. I\u2019m playing, and that\u2019s all I want,\u201d Modric said on Saturday. He has started five of the 10 games so far, but has had minutes in them all, and Vigo reflected a reality that remains: he is still just, well, better than anyone else, still has things Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni, Fede Valverde, Jude Bellingham and Eduardo Camavinga don\u2019t. \u201cI always tell Vini to run into the space; if he does, the ball will come,\u201d he said at Balaidos, which is true \u2013 <em>if</em> he\u2019s the one that has it. Only he could have played the pass; only he would have seen it. As the game slipped from Madrid, there was no one else they would have rather called upon. \u201cHe\u2019s unique in football and in our squad,\u201d Ancelotti said.</p> \n<p>And so, 60 years after Puskas went to Seville with the subs and lost, a legend\u2019s last game ending in defeat having defied time and expectation for longer than anyone could have ever imagined, there was Modric ensuring that neither fate would befall him just yet, grasping another game, ensuring another win. \u201cLuka changed the match,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cHe came on at a very difficult moment and brought control. He has such quality that he always helps us. We\u2019re are lucky to have him. He\u2019s still a fantastic footballer, even if he\u2019s not a kid any more.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

Williot Swedberg had scored an equaliser to make it 1-1, leaping over the advertising boards and into the arms of the ballboys, Balaidos going wild, and Celta were everywhere. Madrid were overwhelmed. But then Modric stepped into the fray. One hundred and 53 seconds later, Madrid led again and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior was running towards the corner, pointing back at the old man, saying: \u201cWhat a pass, what a pass!\u201d This wasn\u2019t done yet \u2013 Celta were superb again and deserved more \u2013 but ultimately another match had been taken back. \u201cCelta play, Madrid win,\u201d AS\u2019s headline read. A few flashes had been enough, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s right foot providing a belting opener, Thibaut Courtois\u2019 left making two superb saves and Vin\u00edcius\u2019s finish delivering a winner, supplied by Modric, who was handed a Madrid shirt after the game with 250 on the back, one for each win he now has with them when it really should have said 39 40, years and days. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t fit or perhaps they were worried about annoying him. \u201cI don\u2019t like being reminded of my age,\u201d he said afterwards, \u201cbut it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Necessary too, Marca\u2019s headline calling him \u201cthe eternal solution\u201d. There is a reason Luka Modric is still around and it\u2019s not nostalgia, not the fact that the player who wasn\u2019t a guaranteed starter when he joined 12 years ago became the best midfielder to ever play for the biggest club of them all. Not the 547 games played or the 27 trophies won, even if that is more than anyone. It\u2019s not the Vicente Calder\u00f3n\u2019s last night in Europe, when he calmly guided them through a biblical storm, an exhibition of superiority and supranatural serenity, that could be titled leave it to me; not the delivery for la d\u00e9cima; not that ridiculous pass to Rodrygo against Manchester City, or the one against PSG you can\u2019t even see if you pause the video at exactly the right point. It\u2019s not the moments or the music, joy in how he played, the outside of his boot, a magician\u2019s wand, or the unique, understated simplicity of it all, although all that is there and always will be. It\u2019s something simpler: he\u2019s still got it. There have been times when there didn\u2019t seem to be long left \u2013 how could there not be closing in on 40? \u2013 and moments when it might have gone some other way, when Modric might have done too. In 2018, he had negotiated with Inter. A World Cup finalist, he had just won a third Champions League in a row and was about to claim the Ballon d\u2019Or. After six years in Madrid, about to turn 33, it was time, he thought; it\u2019s not an idea he has wanted to entertain since. Madrid blocked that move, insisting he would only go if someone paid his \u20ac750m buyout clause, and six years later the man who is on annual contracts, every extension earned one by one, and who Rodrygo calls dad, only a year younger than his actual father, is still rightfully around. That requires a talent that sets him apart and a temperament that does too, an enthusiasm for the game and a determination that goes with it. This isn\u2019t the football Puskas played. Modric is a tough little bastard with calves like cannon balls, a face that is sharp and worn, not an ounce of fat on him, a glimpse of his attitude as well as his art. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to have done this and to continue at the best club in the world,\u201d he said on Saturday, and that pride is part of it. \u201cHe is an extraordinary professional who has character,\u201d Ancelotti said, and he knows; this isn\u2019t someone who welcomes the chance to sit it out for a few minutes, still less allow others to tell him when it\u2019s time to leave, and managing that has not always been easy. Transitions were left incomplete, the predicted decline postponed, any withdrawal put on hold. MLS was an idea floated for a while, not sure that an extension would be offered at the Bernab\u00e9u, but which was packed away again, his determination to fight only strengthened. Martin \u00d8degaard returned early from a two-year loan at Real Sociedad, a pathway opened for him but Modric closed it. The third-fourth playoff at the last World Cup was worth going to if only because surely it was going to be his last, only it wasn\u2019t: last week he played twice for Croatia, taking his caps to 182. Ivan Rakitic went; Modric went on. \u201cHe is a lesson for us all,\u201d his countryman said. After Manchester City beat Madrid 4-0 in the Champions League semi-final in May 2023, it seemed it was goodbye. The year before, as they won the most miraculous title of them all, there had had been a glimpse of the transition already coming, captured in part in a gorgeous photo of Modric and Kroos, two men who had done it all sitting on a bench, spent, watching the kids play. \u201cI have had to ask the younger players for patience and the older players for understanding,\u201d Ancelotti said. He knew it wasn\u2019t easy but defeat at the Etihad meant accelerating that generational change, ushering in a new era, a new style: a shift to something more dynamic, more \u201cmodern\u201d. Except that an eternal, universal truth got in the way: the ball. Ancelotti soon modified his athletic approach in search of control. He would need his veterans after all, although he decided that one would be enough. Thirty-eight and withdrawn at half-time in last September\u2019s derby, Modric didn\u2019t play the next two league games and it was more often Kroos, the last season of his life also the best, that would provide the timing, the vision, the authority that Ancelotti sought. From nine Champions League starts the year before, Modric made just three last season. He wasn\u2019t happy and at times it showed, but there was still a role \u2013 eight European games as a sub, 32 league matches, 18 as a starter \u2013 and it seemed that every time he came on, Madrid got better. A season that seemed likely to be his last, right up to the final days when fans sang for him to stay, offered the perfect end with his sixth European Cup. No one has won more, not even Puskas. Instead, it was Kroos who walked away at 34, five years younger, the timing as impeccable as ever. For him, anyway. And, it turned out, for Modric too, any doubts about his continuity that Madrid might have had swept away, which is what he had wanted, whatever it cost. \u201cLuka and I have different views on how to end our careers,\u201d Kroos said. \u201cI always wanted to end on a great moment, with my body still working well.\u201d \u201cI feel good mentally and physically. I\u2019m playing, and that\u2019s all I want,\u201d Modric said on Saturday. He has started five of the 10 games so far, but has had minutes in them all, and Vigo reflected a reality that remains: he is still just, well, better than anyone else, still has things Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni, Fede Valverde, Jude Bellingham and Eduardo Camavinga don\u2019t. \u201cI always tell Vini to run into the space; if he does, the ball will come,\u201d he said at Balaidos, which is true \u2013 if he\u2019s the one that has it. Only he could have played the pass; only he would have seen it. As the game slipped from Madrid, there was no one else they would have rather called upon. \u201cHe\u2019s unique in football and in our squad,\u201d Ancelotti said. And so, 60 years after Puskas went to Seville with the subs and lost, a legend\u2019s last game ending in defeat having defied time and expectation for longer than anyone could have ever imagined, there was Modric ensuring that neither fate would befall him just yet, grasping another game, ensuring another win. \u201cLuka changed the match,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cHe came on at a very difficult moment and brought control. He has such quality that he always helps us. We\u2019re are lucky to have him. He\u2019s still a fantastic footballer, even if he\u2019s not a kid any more.\u201d",

A building close to Lebanon\u2019s only commercial airport was also struck, video footage showing a smoke plume billowing while a nearby plane sat on the runway.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey struck empty buildings in residential neighbourhoods, and destroyed those surrounding neighbourhoods. These weren\u2019t military centres or weapons caches,\u201d said Ma\u2019an Khalil, the mayor of Ghobeiry municipality in the southern suburbs of Beirut.</p> \n<p>The US envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut hours after the strikes, where he met Lebanon\u2019s parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, and the country\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, to discuss ways towards a ceasefire.</p> \n<p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was also set to depart for a four-day trip to Israel and other countries in the Middle East on Monday, where he will make a renewed push for a ceasefire to both the war in Gaza and Hezbollah-Israel fighting. It will be his 11th trip to the region since the Hamas attack and the beginning of the war in Gaza on 7 October last year.</p> \n<p>\u201cThroughout the region, Secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people,\u201d state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. Blinken will also address improvements in humanitarian aid access to Gaza, which the US said could result in reductions in arms supplies to Israel if aid continues to be prevented from reaching the beleaguered strip.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Israeli forces besieged hospitals and shelters for displaced people in the north of Gaza as they stepped up their operations against Palestinian militants, residents and medics said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/beirut_bombing_targets_map_211024/giv-4559RoEdFX9l2DJy/\" data-alt=\"Map showing Israeli strikes in Beirut between 19 and 21 October\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/beirut_bombing_targets_map_211024/giv-4559RoEdFX9l2DJy/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Before the bombings in Lebanon,<strong> </strong>Israel issued several warnings via X , pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon and warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. Streets from the affected areas were soon choked with traffic as people fled in anticipation of the strikes.</p> \n<p>Al-Qard Al-Hassan has branches across Lebanon, with 15 in greater Beirut alone.</p> \n<p>The strikes were part of what Israel said were efforts to dismantle Hezbollah\u2019s financial system. The Israeli military said on Sunday night that Al-Qard Al-Hasssan financed Hezbollah and the group \u201cuses this money to finance its terrorist activities\u201d, including buying and storing arms.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/lebanon-beirut-attack-israel-hezbollah-al-qard-al-hassan\">Blasts heard across Beirut after Israel warns it will hit Hezbollah-linked finance group</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah\u2019s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel\u2019s targets from just the group\u2019s military wing. The institution had sanctions placed on it by the US in 2017 during the Trump administration for giving Hezbollah access to the international financial system, according to the US treasury.</p> \n<p>Al-Qard Al-Hassan was founded in the early 1980s as a charitable institution, part of Hezbollah\u2019s robust social services network.</p> \n<p>The banking institution became more popular after Lebanon\u2019s 2019 financial crisis, when commercial banks froze almost all accounts and almost entirely stopped issuing loans. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese people, primarily Shia Muslims, bank with Al-Qard Al-Hassan, many of them giving the bank familial assets such as gold in exchange for loans.</p> \n<p>According to Lina Khatib, the director of the Soas Middle East Institute, though Al-Qard Al-Hassan is not the main way in which Hezbollah manages the finances of its social network, the potential loss of the institution would be a \u201csignificant blow\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf this gold is destroyed, Hezbollah\u2019s constituents expect that it will be able to compensate them for their loss.

      "bodyText": "Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley early on Monday morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan. At least 10 airstrikes were carried out in the southern suburbs of the capital, with an entire building collapsing and a jet of fire streaming into the air in the Chiyah neighbourhood. A building close to Lebanon\u2019s only commercial airport was also struck, video footage showing a smoke plume billowing while a nearby plane sat on the runway. \u201cThey struck empty buildings in residential neighbourhoods, and destroyed those surrounding neighbourhoods. These weren\u2019t military centres or weapons caches,\u201d said Ma\u2019an Khalil, the mayor of Ghobeiry municipality in the southern suburbs of Beirut. The US envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut hours after the strikes, where he met Lebanon\u2019s parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, and the country\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, to discuss ways towards a ceasefire. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was also set to depart for a four-day trip to Israel and other countries in the Middle East on Monday, where he will make a renewed push for a ceasefire to both the war in Gaza and Hezbollah-Israel fighting. It will be his 11th trip to the region since the Hamas attack and the beginning of the war in Gaza on 7 October last year. \u201cThroughout the region, Secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people,\u201d state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. Blinken will also address improvements in humanitarian aid access to Gaza, which the US said could result in reductions in arms supplies to Israel if aid continues to be prevented from reaching the beleaguered strip. On Monday, Israeli forces besieged hospitals and shelters for displaced people in the north of Gaza as they stepped up their operations against Palestinian militants, residents and medics said. Before the bombings in Lebanon, Israel issued several warnings via X , pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon and warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. Streets from the affected areas were soon choked with traffic as people fled in anticipation of the strikes. Al-Qard Al-Hassan has branches across Lebanon, with 15 in greater Beirut alone. The strikes were part of what Israel said were efforts to dismantle Hezbollah\u2019s financial system. The Israeli military said on Sunday night that Al-Qard Al-Hasssan financed Hezbollah and the group \u201cuses this money to finance its terrorist activities\u201d, including buying and storing arms. The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah\u2019s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel\u2019s targets from just the group\u2019s military wing. The institution had sanctions placed on it by the US in 2017 during the Trump administration for giving Hezbollah access to the international financial system, according to the US treasury. Al-Qard Al-Hassan was founded in the early 1980s as a charitable institution, part of Hezbollah\u2019s robust social services network. The banking institution became more popular after Lebanon\u2019s 2019 financial crisis, when commercial banks froze almost all accounts and almost entirely stopped issuing loans. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese people, primarily Shia Muslims, bank with Al-Qard Al-Hassan, many of them giving the bank familial assets such as gold in exchange for loans. According to Lina Khatib, the director of the Soas Middle East Institute, though Al-Qard Al-Hassan is not the main way in which Hezbollah manages the finances of its social network, the potential loss of the institution would be a \u201csignificant blow\u201d. \u201cIf this gold is destroyed, Hezbollah\u2019s constituents expect that it will be able to compensate them for their loss. For the time being, the level of trust that Hezbollah\u2019s constituency has in the group remains high despite its huge losses,\u201d Khatib said. Israeli strikes also killed at least 11 people, including a child, in the Bekaa valley and south Lebanon on Monday, as Israeli warplanes continued to bombard wide swathes of the country. A car exploded in the upscale Mazzeh neighbourhood of Damascus on Monday afternoon in what Syrian media reported as a missile strike, though the target is still unknown. Damascus has been targeted several times over the past year, and a strike on Mazzeh earlier this month demolished an apartment building and killed seven people. Israel rarely claims strikes in Syria but has said that it would not allow Iran to establish a presence there. In parallel, Hezbollah announced that it had launched rockets at a groups of Israeli soldiers in Al-Malakiyah and Markaba, south Lebanon. Intense fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters stretched on from Sunday into Monday morning, as Israel continued to conduct cross-border incursions into south Lebanon. Israel has said it is trying to degrade and destroy Hezbollah\u2019s infrastructure and capabilities along the border. Its progress is unclear, as the border areas have been virtually depopulated and media access is limited. On Monday afternoon, Hochstein said implementation of the UN security council resolution 1701 was the path towards a ceasefire in Lebanon and rejected calls to amend the UN agreement. Resolution 1701 ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Under the terms of the agreement, Hezbollah and other armed militias must not be present past the Litani River, about 18 miles (30km) north of the border. The resolution also dictated that Israeli forces withdraw from Lebanon. \u201cThe non-implementation of resolution 1701 is the reason for the intensification and continuation of this conflict,\u201d Hochstein said after meeting Berri, who negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah. It was the US envoy\u2019s first visit to Lebanon since Israel launched Operation Northern Arrows on 23 September. The implementation of resolution 1701 has been viewed as key to stopping the fighting, which started on 8 October last year after Hezbollah launched missiles \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel a day earlier. More than 2,400 people have been killed and more than 11,530 wounded in Lebanon since then. Over the last month, Lebanese officials have stated their willingness to adhere to the resolution, without mentioning Hezbollah\u2019s presence south of the Litani River by name. Hezbollah previously rejected being pushed back from the de facto border, but unprecedented losses for the group have reportedly softened its stance as it seeks a ceasefire with Israel. Almost all of its senior military leadership and its former secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, have been killed by Israeli attacks in the past three months. According to the Axios news website, Israel gave its conditions for a ceasefire to Washington last week in a document that included amendments to resolution 1701.

He accused BHP of devoting \u201cvery substantial resources to placing obstacles in the way of the claimants\u2019 English claims\u201d. A \u201cchasm\u201d had emerged between the level of compensation that BHP regarded as \u201cacceptable\u201d for the disaster and the amount the victims were \u201cmorally and legally\u201d entitled to, the court heard. \u201cThis is not BHP facing up to its responsibilities but cynically and doggedly trying to avoid them,\u201d the claimants\u2019 lawyer claimed in court filings. \u201cAlthough that is BHP\u2019s choice, it cannot properly now claim to be a company \u2018doing the right thing\u2019 by the victims of the disaster.\u201d The opening submission to Mrs Justice O\u2019Farrell went on: \u201cThere is certainly no injustice in the claimants seeking to hold BHP properly to account in London in circumstances where the potential routes for redress in Brazil have not been effective.\u201d About 50m cubic metres of toxic waste was released when the Fund\u00e3o dam was breached on 5 November 2015. The avalanche reached the small community of Bento Rodrigues within minutes, killing 19 people including a seven-year-old child and destroying bridges, roads, houses, factories and other commercial premises as well as farmland, wildlife and historic churches containing priceless artefacts. The dam was managed by a Brazilian company, Samarco, in which BHP and Brazilian miner Vale were joint shareholders. In the wake of the collapse, BHP, along with Vale and Samarco, established the Renova Foundation to provide compensation for individuals and some small businesses for loss and damages, as well as mitigating environmental impacts. Many of the injured parties also brought individual claims in the Brazilian courts but the largest class action was stayed after settlement negotiations were opened. BHP and Vale had proposed to increase their offer in the Brazilian case by about $5bn to nearly $30bn on the eve of the high court trial but it was dismissed by the law firm Pogust Goodhead, which has been preparing the case in London, as a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to avoid accountability. In an opening submission, lawyers for the claimants alleged that BHP had known the risks were high as they increased production at the iron ore mine. \u201cA risk matrix shared with BHP in 2009 considered that the failure of Germano and Funda\u0303o [dams] could lead to \u2018100 fatalities (Bento Rodrigues district),\u2019\u201d the claimants alleged. \u201cA BHP presentation in November 2012 further highlighted that a breach of the dam could reach the community \u2018in less than 10 minutes\u2019, and that the lack of a relocation plan for Bento Rodrigues (in the context of a planned new dam) was a matter for improvement.\u201d In its defence, BHP rejects claims that it is liable as a shareholder and denies any knowledge that the dam\u2019s stability was compromised or that its senior staff \u201capproved matters which caused the collapse\u201d. It writes: \u201cThe BHP Brasil-appointed Samarco directors were not told that the safety of the dam was being compromised. Indeed, they were repeatedly assured by engineers and experts, including independent experts, that dam management was \u2018well controlled\u2019\u201d. The claimants\u2019 legal action is being bankrolled by the US alternative asset manager Gramercy. As well as more than 620,000 individuals, the claimants include 2,000 businesses, 46 municipalities and 65 faith-based organisations. BHP claims in its defence submission that \u201clawyers and funders\u201d will be entitled to \u201ctake up to 30% of the claimants\u2019 compensation in legal fees\u201d. Outside the court, Gelvana Aparecida Rodrigues da Silva, 37, whose seven-year-old son Thiago drowned in the disaster, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been really difficult these last nine years but I have to be strong.

      "bodyText": "Moldovans have voted by a razor-thin majority in favour of joining the EU after a pivotal referendum clouded by allegations of Russian interference. On Sunday, Moldova held key votes in a presidential election and a referendum on EU membership, marking a critical moment in the continuing struggle between Russia and the west for control over the small, landlocked nation in eastern Europe, home to 2.5 million people. After all the votes were counted in the referendum that asked voters to choose whether to enshrine in the country\u2019s constitution a path toward the EU, the \u201cyes\u201d vote crept into first place with 50.46% of the nearly 1.5m ballots cast, according to the Central Electoral Commission. The result meant that the pro-EU campaign won by just more than 13,000 votes, narrowly avoiding a shock setback for the pro-western president, Maia Sandu. The separate presidential election results showed Sandu topped the first round of the vote with 42%. She will face her closest competitor, Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor backed by the pro-Russian Socialists, in the second round in two weeks. \u201cMoldova has won the first difficult battle in the push to join the European Union,\u201d Sandu said at a conference on Monday. She also decried attempts by \u201cforeign forces\u201d to buy votes, describing it as an \u201cattack on Moldovan sovereignty\u201d. The double vote in one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries was seen as a crucial test of Sandu\u2019s pro-European agenda. The result means a clause will be added to the constitution defining EU accession as a goal, though the country\u2019s potential admission to the European bloc is still many years away. The tight referendum result will disappoint Sandu\u2019s supporters and her allies in Brussels. Pre-election surveys indicated that Sandu held a comfortable lead over Stoianoglo and other candidates, while polls suggested that about 60% of voters supported the pro-EU path in the run-up to the referendum. Moldova applied to join the EU after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, which was condemned by Sandu and many in the country as tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees fled to its capital, Chi\u0219in\u0103u. Moldova officially began EU accession negotiations in June, though scepticism remains high about the country\u2019s ability to implement the necessary democratic and judicial reforms in the near future. Observers believe that a weakened Sandu could face a tricky second-round runoff against a united pro-Moscow opposition front led by Stoianoglo. According to preliminary data, Moldovans inside the country voted against the referendum, but ballots from the largely pro-EU diaspora, which were counted towards the end, gave the yes campaign a last-moment push. \u201cSandu had hoped to receive a strong mandate to advance her push for EU integration, but the narrow outcome raises significant questions about the level of support for her policies,\u201d said one western diplomat in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. \u201cHer position is now shakier than it was prior to her decision to call the referendum,\u201d the official added. The two ballots were held amid claims by Moldovan authorities that Moscow and its proxies had orchestrated an intense \u201chybrid war\u201d campaign to destabilise the country and derail its path towards the EU. The allegations against Moscow included funding pro-Kremlin opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections and backing a big vote-buying scheme. As votes were being counted on Sunday, Sandu blamed \u201cforeign forces\u201d for orchestrating an \u201cunprecedented assault on our country\u2019s freedom and democracy\u201d. \u201cWe have clear evidence that these criminal groups aimed to buy 300,000 votes \u2013 a fraud of unprecedented scale,\u201d Sandu added. \u201cTheir objective was to undermine a democratic process.\u201d On Monday, an EU spokesperson blamed Russia and its proxies for \u201cunprecedented interference\u201d in the referendum vote. \u201cMoldova was facing really unprecedented intimidation and foreign interference by Russia and its proxies ahead of this vote,\u201d the spokesperson said. In particular, officials in Moldova have accused the fugitive pro-Russian businessman Ilan Shor, a vocal opponent of EU membership, of running a destabilising campaign from Moscow. Earlier this month, the national police chief, Viorel Cern\u0103u\u021banu, accused Shor and Moscow of establishing a complex \u201cmafia-style\u201d voter-buying scheme and bribing 130,000 Moldovans \u2013 almost 10% of normal voter turnout \u2013 to vote against the referendum and in favour of Russia-friendly candidates in what he called an \u201cunprecedented, direct attack\u201d. Last week, law enforcement agencies said they had also uncovered a programme in which hundreds of people were taken to Russia to undergo training to stage riots and civil unrest. Shor, who is based in Moscow and denies wrongdoing, has openly offered on social media to pay Moldovans to persuade others to vote in a certain way, and said that was a legitimate use of money that he had earned. In the early hours of Monday, he claimed Moldovans had voted against the referendum. Marta Mucznik, a senior EU analyst at the International Crisis Group, said: \u201cThe impact of pro-Russian disinformation campaigns is evident. Tactics such as spreading fake news, vote-buying, and portraying the EU negatively have effectively swayed voters away from pro-EU sentiments. \u201cThe narrow margins highlight a deep split in public opinion and significant polarisation over Moldova\u2019s EU integration goals.\u201d Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said the people of Moldova had \u201cvoted for the European future despite all of Russia\u2019s attempts to buy votes and other foreign interference, including massive disinformation campaigns\u201d. In written comments to the Guardian, he said it was very important for security across Europe to investigate how far foreign interference had affected the election \u201cand how much opinions were influenced by illegal means\u201d. Moscow on Monday sought to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Moldovan elections, claiming that the narrow margin in the country\u2019s constitutional referendum on EU membership \u201craised questions\u201d. \u201cEven in these circumstances \u2026 we saw just how many people don\u2019t support President Sandu\u2019s ideology,\u201d the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said as he urged reporters to wait for the final results of the election. Moldova\u2019s election is part of a series of key votes happening across the region this year. Next week, Georgia, another former Soviet country caught in a tug-of-war between Russia and the west, will hold key parliamentary elections, marking another test of the region\u2019s shift away from Moscow.

When steeped in water, mucilage \u201cabsorbs the liquid and forms a gel-like substance, just like it would in your digestive tract\u201d, explains Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, a registered dietitian and nutritionist based on the Gulf coast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, \u2018Well Actually\u2019, then \u2018Read more on living a good life in a complex world,\u2019 then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say \u2018More from this section\u2019\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Okra water is made by cold-steeping raw, sliced okra pods overnight and then straining out the solids. I made okra water myself while reporting this article, and can confirm that it\u2019s a gooey liquid that tastes of grassy, slightly bitter raw okra. I found it tolerable, but not enjoyable like cooked okra. The idea of using okra just for the slime feels like eating celery just for the string. Is there any real reason to do this?</p> <h2>Does okra water contain nutrients?</h2> <p>\u201cOkra is packed with nutrients like fiber, vitamin C, magnesium and folate,\u201d says Bourgeois. It also contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds like flavonoids, and phenolic acids, which <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661823001688\">help</a> reduce intestinal inflammation and support digestive health. Additionally, because soluble fiber slows down digestion, it can help prevent blood sugar spikes. Some <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10107009/\">studies</a> have found evidence that okra helps control blood sugar in prediabetics; however, one animal study also found that okra reduces the effectiveness of <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22389848/\">metformin</a>, a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes.</p> <p>The wellness influencer Ella Henry, who posted a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@glowwithella/video/7410560196096888095\">TikTok video</a> of herself making okra water, says she believes okra water provides health benefits because of its \u201cthick and slimy\u201d texture, which she interprets as a concentration of nutrients.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/04/what-is-salmon-sperm-facial-injections-kim-kardashian\">People are getting salmon sperm injected into their faces. Why?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Okra water becomes thick because some soluble fiber does seep out of the plant, giving the water a gel-like texture. Since soluble fiber works the same way whether consumed in whole okra or in okra water, the claim that okra water aids digestion is plausible.</p> <p>However, while some nutrients from okra probably do transfer into the water, the concentration is lower than when consuming the whole vegetable. \u201cIf you\u2019re not actually eating the okra slices from your water, you\u2019re missing out on a chunk of those nutrients,\u201d says Bourgeois, including insoluble fiber from the pod and protein from the seeds. You can technically eat the okra slices after steeping, but I drained and pan-fried mine and they were still very wet, so I can\u2019t particularly recommend it.</p> <h2>Is okra water good for childbirth and fertility?</h2> <p>Okra contains folate, an essential vitamin for pregnant people. However, you would need to eat about 2lb of whole okra to get the 600 micrograms of folate daily that doctors recommend during pregnancy. Again, only a fraction of that folate is likely to transfer into okra water. Prenatal vitamins or higher-folate foods like spinach and lentils are better bets.</p> <p>Some animal <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794435/\">studies</a> suggest flavonoids benefit female fertility. Okra does contain these compounds, but is not as rich in them as other vegetables, such as kale and red onions \u2013 though I hope onion water doesn\u2019t become a TikTok trend.</p> <p>Social media posts about okra water\u2019s sexual benefits and effects on labor may be drawing on the idea that drinking something slippery will enhance vaginal lubrication and make labor easier.</p> <p>The notion that eating foods with certain qualities will create a similar effect in the body <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573364/#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20herbs%20also,that%20part%20of%20the%20body.\">dates back</a> to the late 1400s, and is more of a folkloric concept than a scientifically grounded one.</p> <p>\u201cThere really is no scientific data to prove that drinking okra water or other mucilaginous foods will affect your labor \u2026 [or] cause better lubrication in the vagina for a smoother birth,\u201d says Lauran Saunders, a Utah-based registered dietician specializing in prenatal health. \u201cBut it won\u2019t hurt if someone feels inclined to drink okra water,\u201d she adds.

      "bodyText": "Walt Disney said it would announce another replacement for CEO Bob Iger in early 2026 and named a veteran of Morgan Stanley as board chair on Monday, for the first time announcing a timetable for succession at the storied media and entertainment company. James Gorman will step down as executive chair of Morgan Stanley at the end of 2024 and take on the position at Disney in January. He had served as CEO of the Wall Street bank for 14 years and is credited with transforming it into a wealth management powerhouse. Iger stepped down as CEO of Disney in 2020 after 15 years there, serving as executive chair for another year. However, in late 2022, Disney\u2019s board dismissed Iger\u2019s appointed successor, Bob Chapek, and requested Iger return. Investors criticized both men for the turmoil and a series of negative earnings reports, leading to a battle with activist investors. Iger\u2019s current contract with Disney will expire in 2026. In August, Gorman was named head of the committee charged with finding a replacement for Iger, who returned as the company\u2019s CEO in 2022 to replace his hand-picked successor, Chapek. He had orchestrated a CEO succession plan in which Ted Pick took the reins at Morgan Stanley. Gorman\u2019s experience will come in handy at Disney, which was criticized by the activist investor Nelson Peltz for its mishandling of succession. Iger, credited with building out Disney\u2019s media empire including through the high-profile acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and the Star Wars franchise, has seen his retirement date extended five times. \u201cA critical priority before us is to appoint a new CEO, which we now expect to announce in early 2026,\u201d Gorman said in a statement, adding that the timing would \u201callow ample time for successful transition before the conclusion of Bob Iger\u2019s contract in 2026\u201d. Iger had initially planned to stay for two years after coming out of retirement but agreed to extend his tenure through 2026. His contract concludes in December 2026. Gorman will succeed Mark Parker, who is leaving the Disney board after nine years. Parker, who also serves as executive chair of the struggling sports retailer Nike, said he planned \u201cto focus on other areas of my work\u201d. \u201cDrawing on his vast experience, James is expertly guiding the extensive search process for a new CEO, which remains a top priority for the board,\u201d Parker said in a statement. Disney said its board discussed succession planning at each of its regularly scheduled meetings in fiscal 2024 and continues to review both internal and external candidates. Reuters reported last year that four Disney executives were seen as contenders for the role of CEO. Top among them is the Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden, who is a creative TV executive in the mold of Iger, with a string of commercial and critical successes and strong talent relationships. Other internal candidates include the Disney Experiences chair, Josh D\u2019Amaro \u2013 an executive with Iger-like charisma whose portfolio includes the company\u2019s most significant revenue engine, its theme parks \u2013 and the ESPN chair, Jimmy Pitaro, the likable executive who is guiding the sports network\u2019s digital transition. The Disney Entertainment co-chair Alan Bergman, a Disney veteran who oversees the film studio that has released a pair of blockbuster films this year, is also in the running.",

They encounter \u201cevery fear you\u2019re supposed to have as a New Yorker\u201d says Miranda. \u201cFalling into the train tracks. The wrong cop on the wrong night.

And Judas gets all the funkiest bass lines.\u201d</p>    <p>Davis and Miranda compiled playlists evoking what a Warriors musical might sound like. When I ask what songs they chose, they each reach for their phone. We are on a three-way Zoom call and the elegantly dressed Davis\u2019s minimal decor is a contrast to the cluttered shelves behind Miranda, whose baseball cap quotes Hamlet (\u201cwords, words, words\u201d). They fire off their initial ideas: Roy Ayers, the Strokes, Cardi B, Rub\u00e9n Blades, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s All Night. \u201cMs Lauryn Hill is on there with Ready or Not,\u201d says Davis. Hill was one of their coups when casting the roles, and this is where the concept album format trumped a stage production: \u201cWe invited all these incredible artists we would never have got for eight shows a week,\u201d Davis explains. \u201cSo we got to have Marc Anthony and Shenseea and Kim Dracula and all our legendary MCs on the opening number.\u201d</p> <p>The album begins with the thunderous Survive the Night, with dancehall star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/31/shenseea-i-grew-up-listening-to-rihanna-now-she-is-listening-to-me\">Shenseea</a> as a DJ introducing New York\u2019s five boroughs, each represented by top rappers. \u201cTo write verses for some of the greatest writers we have is very, very, very, very, very [put five \u201cvery\u201ds, he insists] intimidating,\u201d admits Miranda.

The film, released amid a wave of other gang movies including The Wanderers and The Outsiders (which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/apr/11/the-outsiders-broadway-review\">now a hit Broadway musical</a>), went halfway to making the gang sympathetic \u2013 and omitted a gang-rape scene that is in the novel.</p> <p>Miranda\u2019s chief change was to make all the Warriors female, a decision inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/gamergate\">Gamergate</a> incident in 2014, which he sums up as \u201cterminally online dudes doxing women who dared to like video games\u201d. That misogynistic behaviour reminded Miranda of the \u201cmalignant chaos\u201d in the film that\u2019s caused by Luther shooting Cyrus, the city\u2019s almighty gang leader who was proposing a truce among the tribes; Luther then blames the Warriors. Miranda and Davis\u2019s gang share a sisterly solidarity as they essentially reclaim the night. Cyrus is now female too, played by Lauryn Hill.</p>    <p>The film is less brutal than the novel but became embroiled in controversy after outbreaks of violence were linked to screenings in 1979. The Washington Post observed it was \u201cdifficult to shake the feeling that the movie is socially irresponsible in some respect\u201d. Davis had never seen the film when Miranda asked her to collaborate; what she responded to most was Cyrus\u2019s truce proposal at the beginning, which is then swept away as the action cranks up. \u201cThere was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/23/campaign-name-south-bronx-street-after-gang-leader\">real-life meeting of all the gangs</a> in 1971 in the Bronx, led by Benjy Melendez of the Ghetto Brothers. And another famous gang truce in 1992 after the uprising in LA,\u201d she says. \u201cSo there\u2019s something very real about that moment, with Cyrus saying, \u2018Can you dig it?\u2019 I was like, \u2018I <em>can</em> dig it!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Davis \u2013 whose plays include Angela\u2019s Mixtape, which featured her aunt, the political activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/05/angela-davis-on-the-power-of-protest-we-cant-do-anything-without-optimism\">Angela Davis</a>, as a character \u2013 turned the truce into a dream of peace threaded throughout the album. The 1971 meeting, she points out, helped form \u201cthe cultural conditions that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/dj-kool-herc-block-party\">created hip-hop officially in 1973</a>. There was a shift from being a gang that\u2019s at war with other gangs to being a crew that is going to battle other crews as MCs, as great dancers, as graffiti writers, as DJs.\u201d She sees the album as a \u201clove letter to the origins of hip-hop\u201d.</p> <p>Collaborating with Davis gave Miranda a welcome contrast to Hamilton, \u201cwhich I largely wrote alone, sweating, chronologically\u201d. Working with Encanto\u2019s soundtrack producer Mike Elizondo, they identified genres including ska, punk and R&amp;B for each gang\u2019s lyrics \u2013 and found a way to represent the Furies, who never speak. The skinhead Turnbull ACs from the Bronx are given a salsa sound. \u201cWhile the Warriors were running, [record label] Fania was revolutionising salsa music all over the world. And those artists primarily lived in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx.\u201d</p>    <p>There are several former Hamilton stars playing the Warriors, including Phillipa Soo, who was invited to record the demos. \u201cIt was all very secret,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd like a family reunion.\u201d Hamilton alumni Sasha Hutchings and Jasmine Cephas Jones were there, as was Amber Gray whom Soo met on her first professional gig after drama school. Their shared history helped establish the bond between the seven-strong Warriors and their new recruit, Mercy, portrayed by Julia Harriman who, like Soo, had played Eliza in Hamilton opposite Miranda. Delineating so many different gang members was one of the main challenges. \u201cReally great writers,\u201d says Soo, \u201care able to encompass an idea, an important plot point or a character trait in a very short amount of time\u201d.</p> <p>In the movie, Luther was played by musical theatre star David Patrick Kelly, who based his portrayal on the New York Dolls after meeting them while working at the famous nightclub Max\u2019s Kansas City. Kelly has a cameo on the album, playing a cop. Miranda tried to write rap verses for Luther \u201cbut the thinking was too ordered\u201d. He sought a more chaotic energy. Davis suggested they use a metal singer, and Atlantic Records led them to the operatic growl of Tasmania\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6o7RtOHpVc\">Kim Dracula</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI think everyone who listens to it goes, \u2018What the fuck was that?\u2019\u201d laughs Miranda. Luther\u2019s demonic number Going Down likens the stations on a New York transport map to dots in a Pac Man game, with him as a ghost hunting the Warriors down. (When Davis first watched The Warriors, she told Miranda: \u201cThis should be a video game.\u201d As a superfan he was a step ahead. \u201cIt is,\u201d he replied. \u201cI play it!\u201d)</p>    <p>The Warriors has such a cult following that there is even a marathon run by fans, tracing the gang\u2019s route through the city. Miranda and Davis made their own way to the parks, subway stations and streets featured in the film \u2013 but took a daytime jaunt rather than an overnight trek.</p> <p>\u201cWe made it all the way to Coney by sunset,\u201d says Davis, who grew up in Berkeley, California: \u201cI truly romanticised New York as a kid. This is the place where you go, like in the movie Fame, and dance on taxicabs.\u201d Miranda was born in New York a year after the film came out. He recalls a golden age of 70s films made on location there, including Dog Day Afternoon and The French Connection. \u201cIf you want the love and peace flipside to The Warriors, watch Godspell \u2013 you see hippies singing about Jesus in the same places the Warriors were fighting.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/18/the-warriors-review-lin-manuel-miranda-and-eisa-davis-come-out-to-play-hamilton-walter-hill\">The Warriors review \u2013 Lin-Manuel Miranda and Eisa Davis come out to play with firecracker musical</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the film, each gang has a signature outfit, from the baseball uniforms of the Furies to the Warriors\u2019 leather vests worn over bare chests. When Miranda screened it at his film club, he put on the vest: \u201cI had to go on a weeklong diet!\u201d The big question is: will Miranda and Davis\u2019s Warriors get all dressed up and hit the stage? Miranda thinks back to when Hamilton tickets were gold dust. With the album of The Warriors, he says, \u201cyou\u2019re not getting the soundtrack to a show you can\u2019t see. You are getting the thing we made. That feels enormously gratifying.\u201d But he admits a theatrical version would be \u201cenormous fun\u201d, and they are open to the idea.

There was a shift from being a gang that\u2019s at war with other gangs to being a crew that is going to battle other crews as MCs, as great dancers, as graffiti writers, as DJs.\u201d She sees the album as a \u201clove letter to the origins of hip-hop\u201d. Collaborating with Davis gave Miranda a welcome contrast to Hamilton, \u201cwhich I largely wrote alone, sweating, chronologically\u201d. Working with Encanto\u2019s soundtrack producer Mike Elizondo, they identified genres including ska, punk and R&amp;B for each gang\u2019s lyrics \u2013 and found a way to represent the Furies, who never speak. The skinhead Turnbull ACs from the Bronx are given a salsa sound. \u201cWhile the Warriors were running, [record label] Fania was revolutionising salsa music all over the world. And those artists primarily lived in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx.\u201d There are several former Hamilton stars playing the Warriors, including Phillipa Soo, who was invited to record the demos. \u201cIt was all very secret,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd like a family reunion.\u201d Hamilton alumni Sasha Hutchings and Jasmine Cephas Jones were there, as was Amber Gray whom Soo met on her first professional gig after drama school. Their shared history helped establish the bond between the seven-strong Warriors and their new recruit, Mercy, portrayed by Julia Harriman who, like Soo, had played Eliza in Hamilton opposite Miranda. Delineating so many different gang members was one of the main challenges. \u201cReally great writers,\u201d says Soo, \u201care able to encompass an idea, an important plot point or a character trait in a very short amount of time\u201d. In the movie, Luther was played by musical theatre star David Patrick Kelly, who based his portrayal on the New York Dolls after meeting them while working at the famous nightclub Max\u2019s Kansas City. Kelly has a cameo on the album, playing a cop. Miranda tried to write rap verses for Luther \u201cbut the thinking was too ordered\u201d. He sought a more chaotic energy. Davis suggested they use a metal singer, and Atlantic Records led them to the operatic growl of Tasmania\u2019s Kim Dracula. \u201cI think everyone who listens to it goes, \u2018What the fuck was that?\u2019\u201d laughs Miranda. Luther\u2019s demonic number Going Down likens the stations on a New York transport map to dots in a Pac Man game, with him as a ghost hunting the Warriors down. (When Davis first watched The Warriors, she told Miranda: \u201cThis should be a video game.\u201d As a superfan he was a step ahead. \u201cIt is,\u201d he replied. \u201cI play it!\u201d) The Warriors has such a cult following that there is even a marathon run by fans, tracing the gang\u2019s route through the city. Miranda and Davis made their own way to the parks, subway stations and streets featured in the film \u2013 but took a daytime jaunt rather than an overnight trek. \u201cWe made it all the way to Coney by sunset,\u201d says Davis, who grew up in Berkeley, California: \u201cI truly romanticised New York as a kid. This is the place where you go, like in the movie Fame, and dance on taxicabs.\u201d Miranda was born in New York a year after the film came out. He recalls a golden age of 70s films made on location there, including Dog Day Afternoon and The French Connection. \u201cIf you want the love and peace flipside to The Warriors, watch Godspell \u2013 you see hippies singing about Jesus in the same places the Warriors were fighting.\u201d In the film, each gang has a signature outfit, from the baseball uniforms of the Furies to the Warriors\u2019 leather vests worn over bare chests. When Miranda screened it at his film club, he put on the vest: \u201cI had to go on a weeklong diet!\u201d The big question is: will Miranda and Davis\u2019s Warriors get all dressed up and hit the stage? Miranda thinks back to when Hamilton tickets were gold dust. With the album of The Warriors, he says, \u201cyou\u2019re not getting the soundtrack to a show you can\u2019t see. You are getting the thing we made. That feels enormously gratifying.\u201d But he admits a theatrical version would be \u201cenormous fun\u201d, and they are open to the idea. All you boppers out there: The Warriors\u2019 journey surely won\u2019t end here. The Warriors is out now on Atlantic Records",

From the rich soil that nurtures our food and stores our carbon, to the green spaces that improve our mental health, biodiversity is an unsung hero upon which our societies and economies thrive. Despite the clear benefits of \u2013 and moral arguments for \u2013 protecting nature, human activities are accelerating biodiversity loss at unprecedented rates. We are destroying habitats, overexploiting natural resources and introducing invasive species, which put plant and animal species at risk of extinction. Human-induced climate change is intensifying biodiversity loss and altering ecosystems, reducing their ability to provide natural climate solutions. Right now, in South America, devastating drought and fires \u2013 exacerbated by climate change \u2013 are destroying millions of acres of forest habitats. Here in the UK, we are one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. If biodiversity loss continues, we will see increased risks to food production, more severe flooding, and weakened natural defences against the further impacts of climate change. All of this could eventually significantly impact GDP. The world\u2019s foremost scientific authority on nature \u2013 the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) \u2013 clearly stated in its last global assessment report that conservation and sustainable use of nature can only be achieved through transformative societal change. It will require all of us to act. This can be difficult, as our lives often appear disconnected from the natural world as a result of our ever-increasing urban and online lifestyles. Science has a crucial role to play in supporting this social transformation, by helping us understand, monitor and communicate the importance and value of biodiversity.

For example, high-resolution satellite imagery is improving the monitoring of penguin colonies in Antarctica, artificial intelligence can identify and track endangered species to combat wildlife poaching, and drones can be deployed to detect forest wildfires earlier.

Plans to revitalise the landscape have been collectively developed to ensure they benefit local people \u2013 the crofters, farmers, landowners, businesses and residents in the area. These collaborative efforts highlight the importance of integrating scientific research with local expertise to protect and restore biodiversity. As countries come together in Colombia this month at the 16th meeting of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), I urge nations to ensure science is at the heart of their commitments and, to collaborate with one another and local stakeholders to protect our planet. Conserving biodiversity is not just an environmental imperative; it is crucial to secure a healthy and prosperous future for all.

With millions of voters already casting early ballots for the presidency ahead of election day on 5 November, a fresh Associated Press/NORC poll says Harris, the Democratic nominee, has taken a slight lead when it comes to some key economic questions that concern middle-class voters.

      "body": "<p>The first song written by Ken Howard, who has died aged 84, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/17/alan-blaikley-obituary\">Alan Blaikley</a>, was The Yellow Dance, and the pair recorded it on Howard\u2019s father\u2019s Dictaphone in 1954. But it was not until the following decade that the Howard-Blaikley duo shifted into high gear and began to develop into a major force in British pop music.</p> <p>In 1964 they chanced across a group called the Sheratons playing in the Mildmay Arms pub in north London. They learned that the band were desperate for new material for their imminent audition with the producer Joe Meek.</p> <p>Howard and Blaikley taught them their composition <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAvF6tfMCq8\">Have I the Right?</a>, Meek loved it, and it was released in June 1964, by which time the group had been renamed the Honeycombs. Meek accurately predicted that it was \u201ca certain No 1\u201d, and, boosted by the support of the DJ Tony Blackburn on Radio Caroline, it topped the British charts in August, reached No 5 in the US, and soared up the charts in several other countries.</p> <p>It was the song that defined the Honeycombs as a one-hit wonder, but Howard and Blaikley rapidly turned into a full-scale hit factory. They had become the managers of the Honeycombs, even though Howard commented that \u201cwe never dreamed of being managers. We hated the image.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, they also found themselves managing their next discovery, Dave Dee and the Bostons, who they saw sharing a Honeycombs bill in Swindon, Wiltshire. Howard explained: \u201cWe changed their name to Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich, because they were their actual nicknames and because we wanted to stress their very distinct personalities in a climate which regarded bands as collectives.\u201d</p> <p>They went on to create a streak of 13 consecutive hits with the group, including the chart-topping fantasy of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsExj_0IHEs\">The Legend of Xanadu</a>, and the Top 10 hits <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RYYFgI_IdM\">Last Night in Soho</a> and the lewd <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suKluG7EwgQ\">Bend It!</a>. Howard described how \u201cwe connived to think of crazy ideas and scenarios. They were really actors; if you gave them a plot they would act up on it, whether it was a whip in The Legend of Xanadu or a motorbike in Last Night in Soho.\u201d</p> <p>Blaikley and Howard also enjoyed significant success with the Herd, who scored Top 5 hits with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=323lYSPDbyQ\">From the Underworld</a> \u2013 based on Virgil\u2019s Orpheus in the Underworld, which the pair had studied in Latin while attending University College school (UCS) in Hampstead, north London \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujlabOc-bg4\">I Don\u2019t Want Our Loving to Die</a>.</p> <p>Other artists benefiting from the pair\u2019s songwriting skills included the Tremeloes, Lulu, Marmalade, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jul/23/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Sacha Distel</a>, Engelbert Humperdinck and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/23/rolf-harris-obituary\">Rolf Harris</a>, and in 1970 they achieved the feat of becoming the first British songwriters to have a song covered by Elvis Presley when the King took <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYmnJ--sAnk\">I\u2019ve Lost You</a> into the US charts in 1970.</p> <p>It had originally appeared on the debut album of Matthews Southern Comfort, another Howard/Blaikley client. I\u2019ve Lost You also featured in the 1970 film Elvis: That\u2019s the Way It Is. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvrT3zQ5BOU\">Heart of Rome</a>, composed by Howard and Blaikley in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/04/geoff-stephens-chart-topping-pop-songwriter-dies-aged-86\">Geoff Stephens</a>, appeared on Presley\u2019s album I\u2019m Leavin\u2019 (1971).</p> <p>Howard was born in Worthing, West Sussex. His father, Harry, was a solicitor and founder member of the London-based law firm Howard Kennedy, and his mother, Beatrice (nee Leigh, and usually known as Betty), had been a concert pianist. He first met Blaikley at UCS when they were both eight years old, beginning a partnership that would let them nurture \u201can intuitive empathy that allows us to short-cut the creative process\u201d.</p> <p>In 1956-57 he attended Aiglon College in Villars, Switzerland, then spent a year working for Granada TV in London before enrolling at Edinburgh University to study social anthropology. While in Scotland he formed the vocal duo Eva and Ken, with Eva Hermann, and performed regularly on the Scottish TV programme Jig Time.</p> <p>After graduation he reunited with Blaikley (who had studied classics and English at Wadham College, Oxford) when they both enlisted as trainee producers for BBC Television, with Blaikley attached to the talks department and Howard in drama.</p> <p>The pair joined with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/03/art.history\">Paul Overy</a>, who would become an art historian and critic, to publish Axle Quarterly, which showcased early work by promising young writers including Melvyn Bragg and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/16/guardianobituaries.books\">Simon Raven</a>. Meanwhile, the duo had begun writing songs, using the collective pseudonym \u201cHoward Blaikley\u201d since their extracurricular activities contravened their BBC contracts. When the corporation gave them an ultimatum, they chose to pursue songwriting.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody counselled us against it,\u201d Howard recalled. \u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re mad \u2013 you can\u2019t leave the BBC. It\u2019s your career\u2019\u2026 But it wasn\u2019t difficult at all. At the time pop music was the thing that England could excel in.\u201d</p> <p>But as the 70s loomed, the music industry was losing its earlier noisy naivety and beginning to develop progressive pretensions. Blaikley and Howard took aim at this new era by writing and producing the concept album Ark 2 by the group Flaming Youth (featuring Phil Collins on drums, shortly before he joined Genesis). This won critical plaudits (Melody Maker made it Pop Album of the Month, while the Sunday Times went one better by making it 1969\u2019s Rock Album of the Year) but was a commercial flop. It was after this that they took on the management of Matthews Southern Comfort, but, though the group had a No 1 hit with a version of Joni Mitchell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIHfuihoz70\">Woodstock</a>, they could not make headway with original material.</p> <p>The pair\u2019s influence in pop was waning, but their skills proved to be eminently transferable to other media. They wrote Frankie Howerd\u2019s theme song to the Up Pompeii film (1971), and in the same year created the innuendo-laden <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6laWnk3W614\">A Knight for My Nights</a>, sung by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/26/eartha-kitt-obituary#:~:text=For%20six%20decades%2C%20the%20American,American%20woman%20breaking%20new%20ground.\">Eartha Kitt</a> in the film Up the Chastity Belt.</p>    <p>The duo\u2019s musical Mardi Gras was staged in the West End in 1976, and Wyndham\u2019s theatre hosted their musical treatment of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13\u00be in 1984-86. The BBC broadcast their TV musicals Orion (based on the Ark 2 project) in 1977, and Ain\u2019t Many Angels the following year. Also in 1978 came the album Life Before Death, in which the duo wrote the music for a collection of poems performed by the psychiatrist RD Laing. In 1990 their musical version of Roald Dahl\u2019s Matilda toured UK theatres.</p> <p>Howard scored several notable BBC productions, among them the award-winning Shadowlands (1985) which starred Claire Bloom and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/20/joss-ackland-obituary\">Joss Ackland</a>. He and Blaikley wrote music for The Flame Trees of Thika (1981), the English civil war drama By the Sword Divided (1983-85) and Miss Marple (1984-92).</p> <p>Howard also directed numerous films for the BBC. John Lennon: A Journey in the Life (1985) was a dramatised documentary to mark the fifth anniversary of Lennon\u2019s death, and starred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/may/06/bernard-hill-obituary\">Bernard Hill</a>. A Penny for Your Dreams (1988) told the story of the cinema pioneer William Haggar, and Mr Abbott\u2019s Broadway (1994) was a tribute to the Broadway writer and director George Abbott.</p> <p>Howard won the Royal Television Society\u2019s Best Children\u2019s Factual award twice, for his BBC films Braveheart and Today I Am a Man. For The South Bank Show on ITV he made profiles of (among others) <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-frank-sinatra-1159412.html\">Frank Sinatra</a>, Danny Kaye and the violinist Maxim Vengerov.</p> <p>He also wrote two novels, The Young Chieftain (2010) and Follow Me: A Quest in Two Worlds (2017), and ran a board games company, Sophisticated Games.</p> <p>He is survived by Benjamin Shorten, with whom he entered into a civil partnership in 2006.</p> <p> \u2022 Ken Howard, songwriter, manager and TV director, born 26 December 1939; died 24 September 2024</p>",

Meek accurately predicted that it was \u201ca certain No 1\u201d, and, boosted by the support of the DJ Tony Blackburn on Radio Caroline, it topped the British charts in August, reached No 5 in the US, and soared up the charts in several other countries. It was the song that defined the Honeycombs as a one-hit wonder, but Howard and Blaikley rapidly turned into a full-scale hit factory. They had become the managers of the Honeycombs, even though Howard commented that \u201cwe never dreamed of being managers. We hated the image.\u201d Nonetheless, they also found themselves managing their next discovery, Dave Dee and the Bostons, who they saw sharing a Honeycombs bill in Swindon, Wiltshire. Howard explained: \u201cWe changed their name to Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich, because they were their actual nicknames and because we wanted to stress their very distinct personalities in a climate which regarded bands as collectives.\u201d They went on to create a streak of 13 consecutive hits with the group, including the chart-topping fantasy of The Legend of Xanadu, and the Top 10 hits Last Night in Soho and the lewd Bend It!. Howard described how \u201cwe connived to think of crazy ideas and scenarios. They were really actors; if you gave them a plot they would act up on it, whether it was a whip in The Legend of Xanadu or a motorbike in Last Night in Soho.\u201d Blaikley and Howard also enjoyed significant success with the Herd, who scored Top 5 hits with From the Underworld \u2013 based on Virgil\u2019s Orpheus in the Underworld, which the pair had studied in Latin while attending University College school (UCS) in Hampstead, north London \u2013 and I Don\u2019t Want Our Loving to Die. Other artists benefiting from the pair\u2019s songwriting skills included the Tremeloes, Lulu, Marmalade, Sacha Distel, Engelbert Humperdinck and Rolf Harris, and in 1970 they achieved the feat of becoming the first British songwriters to have a song covered by Elvis Presley when the King took I\u2019ve Lost You into the US charts in 1970. It had originally appeared on the debut album of Matthews Southern Comfort, another Howard/Blaikley client. I\u2019ve Lost You also featured in the 1970 film Elvis: That\u2019s the Way It Is. Heart of Rome, composed by Howard and Blaikley in collaboration with Geoff Stephens, appeared on Presley\u2019s album I\u2019m Leavin\u2019 (1971). Howard was born in Worthing, West Sussex. His father, Harry, was a solicitor and founder member of the London-based law firm Howard Kennedy, and his mother, Beatrice (nee Leigh, and usually known as Betty), had been a concert pianist. He first met Blaikley at UCS when they were both eight years old, beginning a partnership that would let them nurture \u201can intuitive empathy that allows us to short-cut the creative process\u201d. In 1956-57 he attended Aiglon College in Villars, Switzerland, then spent a year working for Granada TV in London before enrolling at Edinburgh University to study social anthropology. While in Scotland he formed the vocal duo Eva and Ken, with Eva Hermann, and performed regularly on the Scottish TV programme Jig Time. After graduation he reunited with Blaikley (who had studied classics and English at Wadham College, Oxford) when they both enlisted as trainee producers for BBC Television, with Blaikley attached to the talks department and Howard in drama. The pair joined with Paul Overy, who would become an art historian and critic, to publish Axle Quarterly, which showcased early work by promising young writers including Melvyn Bragg and Simon Raven. Meanwhile, the duo had begun writing songs, using the collective pseudonym \u201cHoward Blaikley\u201d since their extracurricular activities contravened their BBC contracts. When the corporation gave them an ultimatum, they chose to pursue songwriting. \u201cEverybody counselled us against it,\u201d Howard recalled. \u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re mad \u2013 you can\u2019t leave the BBC. It\u2019s your career\u2019\u2026 But it wasn\u2019t difficult at all. At the time pop music was the thing that England could excel in.\u201d But as the 70s loomed, the music industry was losing its earlier noisy naivety and beginning to develop progressive pretensions. Blaikley and Howard took aim at this new era by writing and producing the concept album Ark 2 by the group Flaming Youth (featuring Phil Collins on drums, shortly before he joined Genesis). This won critical plaudits (Melody Maker made it Pop Album of the Month, while the Sunday Times went one better by making it 1969\u2019s Rock Album of the Year) but was a commercial flop. It was after this that they took on the management of Matthews Southern Comfort, but, though the group had a No 1 hit with a version of Joni Mitchell\u2019s Woodstock, they could not make headway with original material. The pair\u2019s influence in pop was waning, but their skills proved to be eminently transferable to other media. They wrote Frankie Howerd\u2019s theme song to the Up Pompeii film (1971), and in the same year created the innuendo-laden A Knight for My Nights, sung by Eartha Kitt in the film Up the Chastity Belt. The duo\u2019s musical Mardi Gras was staged in the West End in 1976, and Wyndham\u2019s theatre hosted their musical treatment of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13\u00be in 1984-86. The BBC broadcast their TV musicals Orion (based on the Ark 2 project) in 1977, and Ain\u2019t Many Angels the following year. Also in 1978 came the album Life Before Death, in which the duo wrote the music for a collection of poems performed by the psychiatrist RD Laing. In 1990 their musical version of Roald Dahl\u2019s Matilda toured UK theatres. Howard scored several notable BBC productions, among them the award-winning Shadowlands (1985) which starred Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland. He and Blaikley wrote music for The Flame Trees of Thika (1981), the English civil war drama By the Sword Divided (1983-85) and Miss Marple (1984-92). Howard also directed numerous films for the BBC. John Lennon: A Journey in the Life (1985) was a dramatised documentary to mark the fifth anniversary of Lennon\u2019s death, and starred Bernard Hill. A Penny for Your Dreams (1988) told the story of the cinema pioneer William Haggar, and Mr Abbott\u2019s Broadway (1994) was a tribute to the Broadway writer and director George Abbott. Howard won the Royal Television Society\u2019s Best Children\u2019s Factual award twice, for his BBC films Braveheart and Today I Am a Man. For The South Bank Show on ITV he made profiles of (among others) Frank Sinatra, Danny Kaye and the violinist Maxim Vengerov. He also wrote two novels, The Young Chieftain (2010) and Follow Me: A Quest in Two Worlds (2017), and ran a board games company, Sophisticated Games. He is survived by Benjamin Shorten, with whom he entered into a civil partnership in 2006. \u2022 Ken Howard, songwriter, manager and TV director, born 26 December 1939; died 24 September 2024",

      "body": "<p>Cycling is easily loved during the summer months, but its unalloyed joys tend to become stretched by the time the clocks go back. The weather and vanishing winter sun conspire to inflict a damp, cold and pretty miserable experience on you.</p> <p>You can\u2019t do much about the whims of pressure fronts or the solar system, but you can mitigate the grimness and risks of winter riding with an ever-expanding range of protective and illuminating cycling gear. Here are a few ideas to get you going.</p> <h2><strong>Front lights</strong></h2> <p>Regular front lights won\u2019t cut it for winter riding beyond the urban glow. Knog\u2019s rechargeable Blinder 900 is its most powerful device. It blasts out enough lumens (900, to be precise) to illuminate any unlit B-road or trail for up to 100 metres ahead.</p> <p>Meanwhile, old-school dynamo lights are enjoying a resurgence in adventure cycling and bikepacking, where battery issues can leave riders in the dark. They\u2019re perfect for the commute, too, putting an end to sudden rechargeable battery fails. These lights can work via a front wheel hub generator (you\u2019ll need to get the wheel rebuilt) or as a \u201ctraction\u201d dynamo that presses against the wheel. The Axa light works with either.</p>    <p><strong>Knog Blinder 900 front light, \u00a352.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://fawkes-cycles.co.uk/knog-blinder-pro-900-front-light-p33316\"><sub>fawkes-cycles.co.uk</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>Axa</strong> <strong>Nxt 60 Steady LED dynamo front light, \u00a328.22</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.santafixie.co.uk/axa-nxt-60-steady-led-dynamo-front-light-black.html\"><sub>santafixie.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Hi-vis band</strong></h2> <p>This update on the classic trouser clip is a snap-on band in hi-vis yellow. It can be worn on the upper arm while jogging, or around the lower leg while on the bike, where any trouser gathering away from grimy chains is a practical bonus. If you only wear one, pop it on your right leg to best be seen by overtaking traffic.</p>    <p><strong>B</strong><strong>Twin hi-vis band, \u00a34.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/cycling-hi-vis-armband-neon-yellow/_/R-p-515\"><sub>decathlon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Heated cycle gloves</strong></h2> <p>If your extremities run cold, whether on the road or up a mountain, heated gloves may be the ultimate luxury. This pair from bad-weather specialists Sealskinz aren\u2019t cheap, but they don\u2019t hold back on quality. They have leather palms, breathable insulation, a waterproof layer and a rechargeable battery with up to six hours of toasty time.</p>    <p><strong>Sealskinz Upwell waterproof heated cycle glove, </strong><strong>\u00a3175<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.sealskinz.com/products/waterproof-heated-cycle-glove\"><sub>sealskinz.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Wheel lights</strong></h2> <p>Spoke lights can be fiddly to fit, but these cheap-as-chips alternatives from Halfords screw on to your tyre valves in place of the caps. They light up when in motion to create a Tron-like glowing ring on each wheel, and they\u2019re only to be used in addition to front and rear lights.

Wraparound LED lighting offers a white glow-up front and a reactive red at the rear, which brightens automatically when the rider brakes. There\u2019s an easy-to-fit handlebar switch to trigger indicator lights, and a crash sensor that automatically alerts up to three emergency contacts.

Few cycle clothiers have the jacket pedigree of Rapha, which has designed this hi-vis hooded number specifically for the commute. Perfect for wet and windy mornings, it\u2019s breathable, impermeable and tastefully rather than garishly hi-vis in the pink colourway, with additional reflective flashes.

But for additional security, Garmin\u2019s Varia radar system fits on the back of a bike. It then pairs with a Garmin device or app, which is compatible with Apple devices running iOS 14.1 or later and Androids with the 5.0 operating system or higher, to offer audible alerts when vehicles approach from behind. It\u2019s also available, at a higher price, with a rear light and a camera.</p>    <p><strong>Garmin Varia rearview radar, \u00a3129.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Garmin-Varia-Radar-RVR315_232909.htm\"><sub>tredz.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Mudguards</strong></h2> <p>Mudguards come in as many varieties as bikes themselves. Swedish brand Ass Savers launched its minimalist guards years ago almost as a joke. Almost 15 years later, countless, well, asses have been spared the worst winter can throw at them. The plastic guards slide into the rear of almost any saddle and are ideal for clutter-phobes who don\u2019t want fuller or fitted guards but would quite like to avoid a drenched bottom.</p> <p>For those wanting more protection, all but the speediest road bikes come with mudguard mounting holes, and nobody regrets fitting proper mudguards to their wheels in winter. They spare you, your bike and anyone close behind you the mess of mud or oily road spray, and once fitted they stay firmly on. This set from SKS are a tried-and-tested classic. The German brand also makes a Speedrocker alternative, offering similar protection that can be strapped rather than fixed to bikes. This allows for easy removal on dry days or switching between bikes.</p>    <p><strong>Ass Saver regular mudguard, \u00a37<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.merlincycles.com/ass-savers-regular-mudguard-103566.html\"><sub>merlincycles.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>From \u00a37.64<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/ass-savers-regular-rear-mudguard-4001406/\"><sub>tweekscycles.com</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>SKS Chromoplastic mudguards, from \u00a342.38<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.SKS-Chromoplastic-Full-Length-Mudguards_15491.htm\"><sub>tredz.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Rolltop backpack</strong></h2> <p>Proviz caused a stir with its space-age reflective material when two commuting brothers launched it in London more than 15 years ago. Its early jackets were a little rough around the edges, but the brand has upped its game since, doing justice to the most reflective material known to cycling (it relies on millions of tiny reflective beads).

It\u2019s worth investing in a pair of thicker, longer leggings, or bib tights, which warm the lower organs as well as the exposed leg fronts. You\u2019ll find no shortage of premium Lycra for north of \u00a3200, but Decathlon\u2019s Van Rysel performance range includes this well-reviewed, more affordable pair.</p>    <p><strong>Van Rysel RCR Sport winter cycling tights, \u00a379.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/rcr-sport-winter-cycling-tights/_/R-p-305754\"><sub>decathlon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Snood</strong></h2> <p>An original Buff snood is the multitool of winter cycling gear, offering customisable snug protection on the coldest days.

      "bodyText": "Global heating is causing more of the planet to be burned from wildfires and probably killing an extra 12,000 people a year from breathing in smoke, new research has found. Global heating was particularly increasing the risk of death from wildfire smoke in Australia, South America, Europe and the boreal forests of Asia, one modelling study found. A separate study said between 2003 and 2019 global heating had increased the area of the planet being burned almost 16% but other human actions, including clearing forests and savannahs for roads or agriculture, had lowered the total burned area by 19%. Both studies, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, teased apart the effect that adding greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere was having on wildfires, compared with other human actions such as land clearing. The study \u2013 led by Dr Chae Yeon Park of Japan\u2019s National Institute for Environmental Studies \u2013 estimated that in the 2010s that almost 100,000 people died each year from breathing smoke from fires that contain tiny particles, known as PM2.5, that can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream. How global heating is contributing to these deaths has been difficult to understand because, while hotter temperatures and lower humidity increase the risk of fires, other direct human interventions \u2013 such as the fragmenting of forests and savannahs \u2013 reduce the area that can burn or suppress the spread of fire. To overcome the problem, the researchers looked at three models of global vegetation and fire under today\u2019s climate conditions and compared them to a model where modern-day climate change effects were removed. While the results varied, the authors from eight countries, including the UK, the US, Germany and China, found that in all cases global heating was causing a rising number of deaths from people breathing PM2.5 from wildfires. In some regions temperature increases were the main factor for increasing fire risk while in others, it was lower humidity. The authors said the health effects from wildfires could be underestimated because the \u201ctoxicity of particles originating from fire\u201d were more severe than from other sources. Prof Hilary Bambrick, director of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University, said millions of people in Australia had been exposed to dangerous and prolonged levels of pollution from smoke during the black summer fires in 2019 and 2020. \u201cThis resulted in hundreds of deaths at the time, and will likely have long-term health consequences for many,\u201d said Bambrick, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThis study highlights just one of the many ways climate change is bad for our health. Understanding impacts like these will help us to better plan for the future.\u201d A separate study, led by scientists from the UK and Belgium, found that global heating was increasing the risk of wildfires, in particular in Australia, Siberia and African savannas. Seppe Lampe, of Vrije Universiteit Brussel, said while human activities that changed the landscape were helping to lower the area of the planet being burned, \u201cthe effect of climate change continues to grow\u201d. Prof Wim Thiery, a co-author of the study at VUB, said the rate that climate change was increasing the area burned was \u201cincreasing every year\u201d.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>EARLY DOORS</strong></h2> <p>With a minimum of 25 matches <em>still to be played</em> before the 2024 winners of the biggest prize in American men\u2019s soccerball are identified, Sunday\u2019s announcement that Inter Miami will be handed the \u201chost nation\u201d spot that is up for grabs at next summer\u2019s all-singing, all-dancing and newly bloated Fifa Club World Cup came as something of a surprise. At least it did until it became apparent that it was a decision made by the tournament organisers. We implore you to fasten your seatbelts, reader, because Gianni Infantino is at it again. While the shiny-domed Fifa chief is invariably up to something when it comes to commercial opportunism and the cause of personal advancement, his declaration that Miami had \u201cqualified\u201d for the tournament via a process for which there were no obvious criteria beyond having Lionel Messi in their squad seemed a little cheeky, even by his snakebelly-low standards.</p> <p>Conveniently, Infantino happened to be in Fort Lauderdale over the weekend to see Inter Miami receive<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/inter-miami-points-record-lionel-messi\"> the MLS Supporters Shield</a>, a trophy that is awarded annually to the best team across the \u201cregular season\u201d but is a largely meaningless bauble because there are still so many playoff games to get through before the MLS Cup is won.

      "bodyText": "EARLY DOORS With a minimum of 25 matches still to be played before the 2024 winners of the biggest prize in American men\u2019s soccerball are identified, Sunday\u2019s announcement that Inter Miami will be handed the \u201chost nation\u201d spot that is up for grabs at next summer\u2019s all-singing, all-dancing and newly bloated Fifa Club World Cup came as something of a surprise. At least it did until it became apparent that it was a decision made by the tournament organisers. We implore you to fasten your seatbelts, reader, because Gianni Infantino is at it again. While the shiny-domed Fifa chief is invariably up to something when it comes to commercial opportunism and the cause of personal advancement, his declaration that Miami had \u201cqualified\u201d for the tournament via a process for which there were no obvious criteria beyond having Lionel Messi in their squad seemed a little cheeky, even by his snakebelly-low standards. Conveniently, Infantino happened to be in Fort Lauderdale over the weekend to see Inter Miami receive the MLS Supporters Shield, a trophy that is awarded annually to the best team across the \u201cregular season\u201d but is a largely meaningless bauble because there are still so many playoff games to get through before the MLS Cup is won. While they may very well go on to claim it, for now Inter Miami are nothing more than the best team in the Eastern Conference, but will still take their country\u2019s allocated spot at the Club World Cup even if they don\u2019t go on to be crowned champions of the entire USA USA USA.

Therefore, I am proud to announce that as one of the best clubs in the world, you are deserved participants in the new Fifa Club World Cup 2025 as the host club representing the United States.\u201d Due to kick off next June then, the inaugural Fifa Bigger Club World Cup will feature 31 of the best sides in the world \u2026 and Inter Miami. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Michael Butler from 8pm BST for hot Premier League minute-by-minute coverage of Nottingham Forest 2-2 Crystal Palace. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe UK Saudi ambassador spoke to the Crown Prince this morning\u201d \u2013 ah yes, it\u2019s one of the leaked WhatsApp messages from former Newcastle United minority co-owner Amanda Staveley suggesting that Saudi overlord Mohammed bin Salman was heavily involved in the takeover of the club after all.

Brown told her: \u201cI will make sure your mum is never allowed to forget what she did to my family,\u201d and added: \u201cWherever she goes, her photos will remain and follow her.\u201d</p> <p>The court heard how Brown had \u201cconspired\u201d with her sister, Sophie, and her mother, Sarah \u2013 also both ex-police officers \u2013 to create the fake profile. The webpage included the mobile number of the husband, who was then bombarded with texts and calls after it went live.</p> <p>In a victim personal statement read in court, the woman said that to describe her as feeling \u201cviolated\u201d would be an \u201cunderstatement\u201d.

On Friday, Judge Menary said this was the \u201cultimate act of brinkmanship\u201d on Brown\u2019s part and was a \u201cvery serious aggravating feature\u201d in the case.

Brown told her: \u201cI will make sure your mum is never allowed to forget what she did to my family,\u201d and added: \u201cWherever she goes, her photos will remain and follow her.\u201d The court heard how Brown had \u201cconspired\u201d with her sister, Sophie, and her mother, Sarah \u2013 also both ex-police officers \u2013 to create the fake profile. The webpage included the mobile number of the husband, who was then bombarded with texts and calls after it went live. In a victim personal statement read in court, the woman said that to describe her as feeling \u201cviolated\u201d would be an \u201cunderstatement\u201d. She said she was \u201csickened\u201d that the images were posted on a public website and shared for the sexual gratification of strangers. The woman said: \u201cI\u2019m finding it difficult to believe a woman would do that to another woman.\u201d She also said she was \u201cfearful of what [Brown] is capable of\u201d. Harry Crowson, defending, said Brown had been provided with the photographs by her mother and he said she was \u201cegged on by her family\u201d. The barrister said his client had been severely traumatised by the events of 2012, when she was shown the images as a teenager for reasons the judge said had never been properly explained. Brown, of Morley, Leeds, admitted halfway through her trial earlier this year to two counts of disclosing private images. The woman and her husband had already given evidence by the time the defendant changed her pleas. On Friday, Judge Menary said this was the \u201cultimate act of brinkmanship\u201d on Brown\u2019s part and was a \u201cvery serious aggravating feature\u201d in the case. Because of this, he gave Brown no credit for her guilty pleas.",

The Cards Against Humanity one comes closest, but there\u2019s a pretty bright line. You cannot pay someone to vote, to register to vote, to vote in a particular way in a federal election. Elon Musk is not paying anyone to vote. He\u2019s paying for leads.

But if you\u2019re talking about vote buying, the idea that you\u2019re paying someone for leads, people who might sign a petition that would indicate that they are conservative by signing a second amendment petition, that is not paying someone to vote or to register to vote.</p> <p><strong>If this were a referendum on a ballot, I think it would be different.</strong></p> <p>This is not an official document.

The products include Domino\u2019s BBQ Dip but also a number of seasonings and curry powders with the Favourit and Dunnes Store labels, as well as some Westmorland Family Butchery sausages and burgers. It is the second recall of items from the Leicester-based company in recent weeks: 70 of its products were recalled in September over concerns that those containing mustard could also include undeclared nuts. FGS said following the recall that it had carried out additional testing and had \u201cnot detected any presence of peanut content or residue\u201d, but advised retailers to remove products from sale containing the mustard ingredients. The FSA said the latest recall by FGS was a \u201cprecautionary step\u201d and that anyone returning products would receive a full refund. It added: \u201cThese products are sold under several different brand names at several different retail stores. Point of sale notices will be displayed where the products were sold.\u201d The 70 FGS products containing mustard that were recalled last month included Domino\u2019s garlic and herb dip, as well as some sandwiches and condiments from Spar convenience stores. The FSA said it had traced the contaminated mustard ingredients to a producer in India and had only identified one company, FGS, as having used these ingredients in UK food. The Guardian has contacted FGS about the latest recall.",

The ball Jota was chasing was moving much faster and was arcing off to the right; Levi Colwill, who was around five yards away, was favourite to get to it first. Evanilson, then, was denied a goalscoring opportunity; Jota was not.</p> <p>The penalty Bournemouth were awarded was clear-cut, as David Raya tripped Evanilson. Even Mikel Arteta, whose constant complaints about referees have done much to encourage Arsenal fans\u2019 persecution complex, wasn\u2019t minded to complain, even if he didn\u2019t go so far as to overtly accept the decisions were right.</p> <p>The conspiracy theory favoured by Arsenal fans seemed to be that the VAR official Jarred Gillett, an Australian, was a boyhood Liverpool fan, which is why he has never refereed a Liverpool game in the Premier League. Saliba will now be suspended for Arsenal\u2019s game against Liverpool. But even leaving aside the frankly childish idea that professional officials cannot be objective, the basic point remains that the decision reached was the correct one.</p> <p>While the Saliba red card in an indirect way went for Liverpool, the two big VAR calls at Anfield both went against them: not only the non-dismissal of Adarabioyo, but also the overturning of a penalty when Robert S\u00e1nchez was deemed to have got enough on the ball before Curtis Jones went over the top of him for it not to be a foul. The case seemed borderline and S\u00e1nchez was probably saved by the fact that his forward momentum had slowed by the time of the collision. Whether VAR should have got involved is questionable, but the call was subjective; whether a penalty or not, it would be hard to say it was definitively wrong.</p> <p>Manchester City\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/20/wolves-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">last-minute winner against Wolves</a> falls into a similar category. It could be argued that Bernardo Silva was close enough to the Wolves keeper Jos\u00e9 Sa when John Stones headed the ball goalwards to be interfering with him. He was close enough, after all, to have bumped into Sa as the corner was taken (when he was not offside), and had Stones\u2019s header been directed towards Sa\u2019s right-hand post it would have passed very close to Silva. But Silva was not in his eyeline, and the header went in the middle of the goal. When Wolves had a goal disallowed in similar circumstances against West Ham last season, their manager Gary O\u2019Neil called it \u201cone of the worst decisions I\u2019ve ever witnessed\u201d; his view was notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/20/oneil-questions-big-guy-bias-after-controversial-city-goal-sinks-wolves\">different this time</a>.

Fans know the game is in grave danger; that mega-rich owners, far richer than any previous owners, have the potential to bankrupt whole competitions through repeated legal action of questionable merit.

The best thing that has ever been donated was a Chanel bag, which we sold on eBay for slightly less than \u00a31,000. But the best item I have ever bought for myself was, without a doubt, a vodka decanter in the shape of a rooster. It\u2019s just so cool! I\u2019ve never seen anything similar and it\u2019s in such good condition. </p>    <p>I keep a list of strange donations on my phone. For a while, a stranger kept leaving brown paper bags filled with courgettes outside our back door. We had someone\u2019s collection of ceramic ducks (139 in total), a hollowed-out emu egg, a taxidermied mouse, a briefcase with money, and two plastic bags filled with matches.</p>    <p>A close second favourite of mine is a Tiffany-style lamp in the shape of a tortoise. Whoever owned these things before me has taken fantastic care of them.</p> <p>The two worst donations? During a balmy June I unearthed a pint of milk that looked ready to pop, but first place goes to a donation of ashes. They were kept, for some reason, in a decorative teapot. <strong>Eve, 25, Cambridgeshire </strong></p> <h2>\u2018He\u2019d bought my book before we met\u2019</h2> <p>In about 2011, I had finished a degree in English literature and had started training as a midwife. I went through all the books I had accumulated over three years of my literature degree, and I gave a lot to my local Cancer Research charity shop where my mum was a longtime volunteer. It included a copy of The Plague by Albert Camus. In 2013, I got together with the man who would later become my husband. In the heady early days of dating, I started leaving little notes for him on his car or on his doorstep for him to find.</p>    <p>I got a message one night saying: \u201cI think I\u2019ve found something amazing.\u201d It transpired he had seen my writing before; some years before we met, he had bought a copy of Camus\u2019s The Plague from the same charity shop. It was full of scribbles in the margins and he had noticed that the letters y and s had very pronounced curls. It wasn\u2019t until I left him the notes that he realised he had bought my book. We felt like it was this amazing connection between us before we\u2019d even met each other. We\u2019ve been together 11 years now and have two children, and the book I gave away in 2011 is a very precious possession. <strong>Sian Gossa, 35, London </strong></p> <h2>\u2018My jaw dropped\u2019</h2>    <p>My first fabulous charity shop find was in about 2002, when I was a student. It is an exquisite original Pat Albeck tin from the 1970s that was priced at an amazing 50p! I have since become a collector of her work; tins, fabric and more. I have never come across an example of this design anywhere else. It is my most prized possession, proudly displayed on my kitchen wall.</p>    <p>My second best find is a picture I used to have hanging on my bedroom wall as a child. It was given away to charity, probably in Peterborough. Then one day, purely by chance, I was walking through Northampton hospital and there it was in the window of the hospital charity shop. My jaw dropped and I instantly bought it. It now has pride of place on my daughters\u2019 bedroom wall. I am sure it is the exact one I used to own because it has been professionally framed and I recognise the colour of the card mount and the frame. I think the chances of two people choosing to frame the print in the same way are slim. <strong>Charlie, 46, </strong><strong>East Midlands</strong><strong> </strong></p> <h2>\u2018I started wondering about the rattling sound\u2019</h2> <p>About 15 years ago I was after a birthday present for my mum. She collects tea and coffee pots, so charity shops are a great place to look. I found one of these one cup-plus-pot stacked combos. I paid for it and took it home, where I started wondering about the rattling sound coming from inside the pot. Turns out it was dentures. Needless to say I gave it to her without the dentures. My mum loves to tell that story to everyone. <strong>Anja, Bristol </strong></p> <h2>\u2018I opened the book \u2013 and there was my dad\u2019</h2>    <p>About seven years ago I was volunteering in the Oxfam bookshop in Exeter. I saw a book about the Arctic convoys waiting to be sorted. My dad was on the Arctic convoys in the second world war, but he wouldn\u2019t talk about it. I knew his ship was the Northern Gem, so I looked in the index to see if there were any entries for that ship, and there were. In the book there was a picture of the Northern Gem that I had never seen \u2013 and there was my dad! I could so easily have missed it. Someone could have priced it and put it out to sell and I might never have seen it. Of course, I had to buy the book. <strong>Jane Thurnell-Read, 76, </strong><strong>Exminster</strong><strong>, Devon </strong></p> <h2>\u2018I noticed an old picture frame among all the modern ones\u2019</h2>    <p>While browsing in a Southampton charity shop, I noticed an old picture frame among all the modern ones in a box. The oil-on-board painting showed a Scottish harbour with herring boats, herring girls and fishermen on the quayside, and was signed D Martin. It was only \u00a34.50 so I bought it, took it home and hung it on my wall, vowing to take it to Scotland whenever my next visit would be. I was always intrigued about it, so when I heard the Antiques Roadshow was being held in Salisbury five years ago, I took it along for valuation. I didn\u2019t make it on to TV, but I was introduced to Frances Christie, who told me D Martin was not a well-known Scottish artist, but valued the picture at \u00a3500. I was ecstatic and a few weeks later travelled down to Lymington auction rooms to place it in their next sale. Unfortunately, the reserve was not met, so I retrieved the painting and put it back on my wall.</p> <p>Four years later, I sold the painting for \u00a3200 at Great Western Auctions in Glasgow. Although this was a lot less than the valuation, I was happy with the price. I just hope the painting went home to a Scottish collector. <strong>Sandra Kimber, 61, Southampton </strong></p>",

We had someone\u2019s collection of ceramic ducks (139 in total), a hollowed-out emu egg, a taxidermied mouse, a briefcase with money, and two plastic bags filled with matches. A close second favourite of mine is a Tiffany-style lamp in the shape of a tortoise. Whoever owned these things before me has taken fantastic care of them. The two worst donations? During a balmy June I unearthed a pint of milk that looked ready to pop, but first place goes to a donation of ashes. They were kept, for some reason, in a decorative teapot. Eve, 25, Cambridgeshire \u2018He\u2019d bought my book before we met\u2019 In about 2011, I had finished a degree in English literature and had started training as a midwife. I went through all the books I had accumulated over three years of my literature degree, and I gave a lot to my local Cancer Research charity shop where my mum was a longtime volunteer. It included a copy of The Plague by Albert Camus. In 2013, I got together with the man who would later become my husband. In the heady early days of dating, I started leaving little notes for him on his car or on his doorstep for him to find. I got a message one night saying: \u201cI think I\u2019ve found something amazing.\u201d It transpired he had seen my writing before; some years before we met, he had bought a copy of Camus\u2019s The Plague from the same charity shop. It was full of scribbles in the margins and he had noticed that the letters y and s had very pronounced curls. It wasn\u2019t until I left him the notes that he realised he had bought my book. We felt like it was this amazing connection between us before we\u2019d even met each other. We\u2019ve been together 11 years now and have two children, and the book I gave away in 2011 is a very precious possession. Sian Gossa, 35, London \u2018My jaw dropped\u2019 My first fabulous charity shop find was in about 2002, when I was a student. It is an exquisite original Pat Albeck tin from the 1970s that was priced at an amazing 50p! I have since become a collector of her work; tins, fabric and more. I have never come across an example of this design anywhere else. It is my most prized possession, proudly displayed on my kitchen wall. My second best find is a picture I used to have hanging on my bedroom wall as a child. It was given away to charity, probably in Peterborough. Then one day, purely by chance, I was walking through Northampton hospital and there it was in the window of the hospital charity shop. My jaw dropped and I instantly bought it. It now has pride of place on my daughters\u2019 bedroom wall. I am sure it is the exact one I used to own because it has been professionally framed and I recognise the colour of the card mount and the frame. I think the chances of two people choosing to frame the print in the same way are slim. Charlie, 46, East Midlands \u2018I started wondering about the rattling sound\u2019 About 15 years ago I was after a birthday present for my mum. She collects tea and coffee pots, so charity shops are a great place to look. I found one of these one cup-plus-pot stacked combos. I paid for it and took it home, where I started wondering about the rattling sound coming from inside the pot. Turns out it was dentures. Needless to say I gave it to her without the dentures. My mum loves to tell that story to everyone. Anja, Bristol \u2018I opened the book \u2013 and there was my dad\u2019 About seven years ago I was volunteering in the Oxfam bookshop in Exeter. I saw a book about the Arctic convoys waiting to be sorted. My dad was on the Arctic convoys in the second world war, but he wouldn\u2019t talk about it. I knew his ship was the Northern Gem, so I looked in the index to see if there were any entries for that ship, and there were. In the book there was a picture of the Northern Gem that I had never seen \u2013 and there was my dad! I could so easily have missed it. Someone could have priced it and put it out to sell and I might never have seen it. Of course, I had to buy the book. Jane Thurnell-Read, 76, Exminster, Devon \u2018I noticed an old picture frame among all the modern ones\u2019 While browsing in a Southampton charity shop, I noticed an old picture frame among all the modern ones in a box. The oil-on-board painting showed a Scottish harbour with herring boats, herring girls and fishermen on the quayside, and was signed D Martin. It was only \u00a34.50 so I bought it, took it home and hung it on my wall, vowing to take it to Scotland whenever my next visit would be. I was always intrigued about it, so when I heard the Antiques Roadshow was being held in Salisbury five years ago, I took it along for valuation. I didn\u2019t make it on to TV, but I was introduced to Frances Christie, who told me D Martin was not a well-known Scottish artist, but valued the picture at \u00a3500. I was ecstatic and a few weeks later travelled down to Lymington auction rooms to place it in their next sale. Unfortunately, the reserve was not met, so I retrieved the painting and put it back on my wall. Four years later, I sold the painting for \u00a3200 at Great Western Auctions in Glasgow. Although this was a lot less than the valuation, I was happy with the price. I just hope the painting went home to a Scottish collector. Sandra Kimber, 61, Southampton",

Volkswagen has been forced to pay customers \u00a321.5m in compensation on top of a fine of \u00a35.4m for failing to treat struggling customers fairly, including repossessing vehicles from people who had attempted suicide or were caring for sick relatives. The UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said 110,000 customers had suffered detriment because of the unfair actions of Volkswagen Financial Services (VWFS), which is wholly owned by the German carmaker. Goldman Sachs has predicted that UK interest rates are on course to fall to 2.75% by next Autumn as the Bank of England reduces the cost of borrowing at each of its nine next meetings. Economists at Goldman Sachs said their assessment of the long-term level of interest rates consistent with achieving the Government\u2019s 2% inflation target meant the markets were under-estimating the likely extent of the action by Threadneedle Street\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee. In a research note, Goldman said: \u201cOur findings suggest that Bank Rate remains notably restrictive and \u2013 together with rapidly falling inflation and dovish MPC commentary \u2013 reinforces our view that the Bank of England will ultimately lower rates more than priced.\u201d China\u2019s banks have lowered their key lending rates, as Beijing tries to stimulate its economy and hit its growth targets. Gold has hit a new alltime high, of $2,740 per ounce, lifted by geopolitical fears and the possibility that Donald Trump wins the presidential election. The number of UK homes being sold is up almost a third, year on year, so far this month, although the traditional autumn price bump has failed to emerge due to buyers being spoilt for choice, Rightmove has reported. The owner of TikTok has sacked an intern for allegedly sabotaging an internal artificial intelligence project. Transport for London (TfL) could be forced to pay back millions of pounds in low emission zone fines issued to Dutch lorry drivers after agreeing they had been issued unlawfully. Just in: a closely-watched survey of the US economy has deteriorated. The Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI) for the US declined by 0.5% in September 2024 to 99.7, following a 0.3% decline in August. Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, senior manager for business cycle indicators at The Conference Board, says: \u201cWeakness in factory new orders continued to be a major drag on the US LEI in September as the global manufacturing slump persists. Additionally, the yield curve remained inverted, building permits declined, and consumers\u2019 outlook for future business conditions was tepid. Gains among other LEI components were not significant enough to offset weakness among the four gauges mentioned above. Overall, the LEI continued to signal uncertainty for economic activity ahead and is consistent with The Conference Board expectation for moderate growth at the close of 2024 and into early 2025.\u201c Stocks have opened cautiously in New York at the start of the new trading week. Back in the financial markets, the oil price has rallied by around 1.5% today. Brent crude has risen by over $1 per barrel to $74.19/barrel, which recovers most of Friday\u2019s losses. The gains follow this morning\u2019s cuts to China\u2019s borrowing rates, which could lead to higher demand for energy, and the head of Saudi Aramco saying he remains \u2018bullish\u2019 China\u2019s oil demand. Fears of supply disruption due to the crisis in the Middle East are also a factor. In another boardroom shake-up, Disney has named that banker James P. Gorman as its next chairman. Gorman, the executive chair of Morgan Stanley, will take up the role on 2nd January next year. Top of Gorman\u2019s to-do list will be to finalise the choice of Disney\u2019s next chief executive, to succeed Bob Iger. He is currently chair of the Disney Board\u2019s Succession Planning Committee, which is working to pick the next CEO \u2013 although a decision is still more than a year away! Gorman says: \u201cA critical priority before us is to appoint a new CEO, which we now expect to announce in early 2026. This timing reflects the progress the Succession Planning Committee and the Board are making, and will allow ample time for a successful transition before the conclusion of Bob Iger\u2019s contract in December 2026.\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2019s economists have also had a look at the path of UK interest rates. They estimate that the short-term neutral rate (i.e. r*) may be anywhere between 3.75% to 5%, with the medium-term neutral rate (i.e. R*) hovering around 2.25% to 3.75%. What does this mean for policy? Well, they say: Bank Rate remains restrictive. Based on the above estimates, our suite of policy rules suggests that Bank Rate should be closer to 4.25% \u2013 in line with our average estimate for the short-term neutral rate. This implies that Bank Rate has much further to fall given our expectations of inflation, growth, and unemployment. GSK is investing \u00a350m in a five-year partnership with the University of Cambridge and university hospitals, where scientists and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) experts will work together and apply new techniques. This includes single cell technologies to understand how genes are expressed in individual cells, to provide \u201cthe right treatment for the right patient\u201d. Bringing together patient data and AI/ML, the researchers will focus on hard-to-treat diseases which affect the kidneys and lung. Kidney disease affects 850 million people, 10% of the world\u2019s population, while chronic respiratory diseases affect 545 million people. The ambition is to more precisely treat immune-related diseases with existing therapies and develop new ones more quickly. Tony Wood, GSK\u2019s chief scientific officer, said: \u201cBy bringing together Cambridge\u2019s expertise and our own internal capabilities, including understanding of the immune system and the use of AI to accelerate drug development, we have an opportunity to help patients struggling with complex disease.\u201d This comes ahead of GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley co-chairing the Life Sciences Council on Tuesday, a forum for discussion where ministers and pharma bosses meet. The company also has a collaboration with the University of Oxford, focused on neurological diseases. Banks are already anticipating cuts to UK interest rates, by making their savings rates less generous. The average savings rate on accounts requiring notice to be given before the account can be unlocked was 4.21% at the start of this month, its lowest level since October 2023 new data from Moneyfacts today shows. The average notice Isa rate fell to 4.03% \u2013 also the lowest level since October 2023. Moneyfacts also reports that average mortgage rates are flat today, saying: The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.41%. This is unchanged from the previous working day. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.09%. This is unchanged from the previous working day. Goldman Sachs\u2019 forecasts implies that the Bank of England will cut UK interest rates by a quarter of one percentage point at its next nine meetings. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year, so a 25 basis point cut at each one would bring Bank Rate down to 2.75% by November 2025. Goldman Sachs have cut their forecast for UK interest rates, and now predict that Bank rate will have fallen to 2.75% by next November. The forecast comes in a new research note in which Goldman tries to estimate r* \u2013 the neutral real rate of interest which is expansionary nor contractionary while the economy is at full employment with inflation at target. Goldman\u2019s analysis has concluded that r* has trended down strongly in recent decades and has risen moderately since the Covid-19 pandemic. Their estimates suggest r* is around 0.75%, which implies a nominal neutral rate of around 2.75% with inflation at the 2% target. Goldman\u2019s economists suggest rates will fall to 2.75% by November 2025, down from 5% today. Goldman says: Our findings suggest that Bank Rate remains notably restrictive and\u2014together with rapidly falling inflation and dovish MPC commentary\u2014reinforces our view that the BoE will ultimately lower rates more than priced. We remain comfortable with our forecast for consecutive 25bp cuts and lower our terminal Bank Rate forecast to 2.75% in November 2025 (from 3% in September 2025), notably below current market pricing. The money markets are today indicating there\u2019s a 98% chance that the Bank cuts rates at its next meeting in November, from 5% to 4.75%. By next November, the markets suggests rates could be 3.75% or lower \u2013 ahead of Goldman\u2019s new forecast. Ocado Group is lining up Adam Warby, a former IBM and Microsoft executive, to be its next chairman, reports the ever-well-informed Mark Kleinman of Sky News. He\u2019d succeed Rick Haythornthwaite, who is also now the chair of NatWest. UK consumer confidence has improved this month, as falling inflation helps households, in an encouraging sign ahead of next week\u2019s budget. S&amp;P Global\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) has risen this month, closer to July\u2019s 37-month high The CSI hit 47.3 in October, up from 46.0 in September. That\u2019s the second-highest reading in over three years, exceeded only by July\u2019s post-general election bounce. Maryam Baluch, economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says: \u201cConsumer confidence is showing signs of reviving again after being hit by gloomy talk surrounding the Budget, which pulled sentiment off the recent post-election high seen in July. Confidence is being supported first and foremost by the strong labour market, with the survey showing both job security and income from employment improving at some of the fastest rates seen since data were first collected in 2009. An easing of inflation worries, combined with expectations of a further lowering of interest rates, has also helped allay worries over the cost of living. Households remain cautious in their spending, and report a further fall in savings to underscore how \u2013 despite both now heading lower \u2013 inflation and interest rates continue to squeeze household finances. However, attitudes towards making major purchases, such as cars or large domestic appliances, which is a good indicator of overall consumer spending, is running at one of the highest levels seen over the past three years, in a further sign of better things to come.\u201d The FCA alaso reports that a third Volkswagen customer was let down after taking out car finance and immediately falling behind on the payments. The customer, described as \u201cyoung\u201d and living with her parents, told Volkswagen she had lost her job owing to mental health issues; having returned to work, she wished to set up a payment arrangement to clear the outstanding balance. VWFS, though, terminated the agreement and started the repossession process. The customer\u2019s mother managed to sell the car through a third-party sale, hoping to raise more money than if Volkswagen sold it at auction. But VWFS refused to allow the remaining balance to be repaid in a payment arrangement, and insisted it was repaid in full. That bill included a \u00a3252 charged described as a \u201csundry debit\u201d and an \u201cadjustment\u201d, but was actually a repossession fee. The FCA\u2019s investigation has found that Volkswagen\u2019s staff took a rigid approach to problems, and didn\u2019t give customers options to tackle their debts if they fell behind on their car payments. That included charging customers a repossession fee of \u00a3252, irrespective of their circumstances, which only ended in September 2022. The FCA says: This may have compounded such customers\u2019 financial difficulty with little consideration of how these fees would be paid. Moreover, VWFS did not consistently highlight repossession fees to customers at the time of termination, including in writing. Volkswagen Financial Services has apologised for the failings identified by the FCA, saying (via Reuters): \u201cWe are in the process of concluding our remediation efforts as we continue to provide goodwill payments to affected customers and apologise for any detriment caused.\u201d Volkswagen Finance would have been fined \u00a37,710,885, but it has received a 30% discount in return for agreeing to resolve the problems identified by the FCA. The financial penalty must be paid in full by VWFS no later than 4 November. German carmaker Volkswagen\u2019s financial services arm has been fined by UK competition regulators for mistreating customers in financial difficulties. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited \u00a35,397,600 for failing to treat its over 100,000 customers in financial difficulty fairly. VWFS has agreed to pay over \u00a321.5m in redress to around 110,000 customers who may have suffered harm because of its failings. VWFS is one of the UK\u2019s largest motor finance providers, and provides a range of products to help customers buy several well-known motor brands, including Volkswagen, Skoda and Porsche. The FCA has found that it failed to treat customers in financial difficulty fairly and communicate information to them in a clear and fair way, if they fell behind on their repayments. The FCA says: This included in some instances (a) exacerbating stress and anxiety for customers who were already struggling with their mental well-being; (b) failing to understand individual customer circumstances resulting in cars being taken away from customers, some of whom used their cars for work; (c) further distress and upset caused to vulnerable customers who may have felt unsupported and unheard; and (d) forgoing other priority payments due to demands to pay arrears on car finance. The FCA\u2019s ruling cites one customer who fell into arrears, and explained their complex and worsening physical and mental health difficulties to VWFS. They received no empathy, but were \u201csarcastically\u201d reminded how many days are in a month by VWFS\u2019s agents, the FCS says. In a second case, a customer took out car finance but later could not afford the repayments. They were told it would cost them \u00a320,000 to give the car back. Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, says: \u201cFor many, a car is not a nice to have but a necessity for work or for family life. Volkswagen Finance made tough personal situations worse by failing to consider what those in difficulty might need. It is right it compensates those who suffered. This fine and redress should send clear signals to lenders that they need to properly support those in financial difficulty.\u201d In the UK property market, more houses are available for sale this autumn, but there\u2019s little movement on price. Rightmove has reported this morning that the number of sales being agreed has risen by 29% this month, year-on-year, in \u201ca strong rebound from the weaker market a year ago\u201d. But the average asking price has only risen by 0.3% this month, to \u00a3371,958, much lower than the average 1.3% monthly increase at this time of year. Rightmove reckons underlying buyer demand remains strong, as 17% more people are contacting estate agents than a year ago. But uncertainty caused by the Autumn Budget could be weighing on the market, with \u201csome buyers may be waiting for Budget clarity and cheaper mortgage rates before acting\u201d, they suggest. Rightmove\u2019s Tim Bannister says: \u201cSales activity has not only bounced back from the low of last year but has continued an upward trajectory. There is also a healthy level of underlying buyer demand as people continue to plan their next move.\u201d Shares in precious metals producer Fresnillo have jumped 4% in early trading, tracking the gold price higher. That puts Fresnillo on the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. News of China\u2019s rate cuts are helping the mining sector too, with Antofagasta (+1.9%) and Glencore (+1.4%) among the risers. Gold is continuing to rally, and has hit a new alltime high early this morning. The spot price of gold is up 0.4%, or around $10 per ounce, to $2,732.73 per ounce, meaning it has now risen by over 32% during 2024. Analysts say the conflict in the Middle East, and uncertainty over the US presidential election, are pushing investors into safe haven assets such as gold. Expectations of further interest rate cuts from major central banks are also supporting the price of gold (which doesn\u2019t pay a yield to investors). Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explains that several factors are pushing up the gold price, including the possibility that Donald Trump wins next month\u2019s presidential election: \u201cGeopolitical instability, sluggish economic growth in key regions, a shift in central bank policies towards lower interest rates, and most recently, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election have all contributed.\u201d \u201cRumours that Donald Trump may be on the verge of winning the election have further fuelled demand for gold, driving it to historical highs. Faced with the possibility of a second term for the Republican candidate, markets are turning to gold, the ultimate safe-haven asset.\u201d Over in German, wholesale inflation has fallen by more than expected. German industrial producers lowered the prices of their products by 0.5% during September, meaning they were 1.4% lower than a year ago. The main reason for the drop in the PPI rate was a decline in energy prices. They were 6.6% cheaper in September 2024 than in September 2023, including 14.4% drop in prices of mineral oil products. Falling producer prices should feed though to consumer prices in the shops, and could give the European Central Bank confidence to cut interest rates again in December. The head of oil giant Saudi Aramco has declared that his company is fairly bullish on China and oil demand, especially following Beijing\u2019s stimulus package. Speaking on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week conference, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said: \u201cWe see more demand for jet fuel and naphtha especially for crude-to-chemical projects.\u201d Prices of iron ore futures have risen, partly thanks to today\u2019s lending rate cuts in China. The most-traded January iron ore contract on China\u2019s Dalian Commodity Exchange gained 1.5% to trad at 770 yuan (\u00a383) per metric tonne. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Banks in China have cut borrowing costs in the latest attempt to stimuluate growth across the Chinese economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) has announced today that its two benchmark lending rates are being cut, by a quarter of one percent. China\u2019s one-year loan prime rate \u2013 a reference for loans to businesses and consumers \u2013 has fallen to 3.1% from 3.35%. The five-year LPR \u2013 the benchmark for mortgages \u2013 has been cut from 3.85% to 3.6%. The LPR rates are set by a group of China\u2019s major banks, and today\u2019s reductions show they are passing on last month\u2019s interest rate cut from the PBOC. Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered says: \u201cThe larger cuts confirm the PBOC\u2019s stance of easing monetary policy more quickly, and echo the Politburo\u2019s statement of cutting rates more forcefully.\u201d Some stocks rallied after the cuts were announced, with the Shenzhen SE Composite index gaining around 1.4% today. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, says: Sure, the rate cut wasn\u2019t a shocker, but the market is banking on the idea that the combined impact of all these recent measures could at least stem the economic bleeding. However, the reality seems to be that the Chinese Communist Party is desperately trying to harness the wealth effect from local equities to keep morale high. It\u2019s a classic case of \u201chope floats\u201d until the actual economic recovery kicks in\u2014whenever that might be. Just look at Friday when Xi Jinping sent PBoC Governor Pan Gongsheng to pump some life into the markets with a pep talk, and guess what? It worked. Mainland and Hong Kong-listed stocks surged, the kind of response Beijing was banking on. It\u2019s the latest in a flurry of attempt to stimulate the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after growth slowed to an 18-month low last week. Last month, China announced wide-ranging measures including interest rate cuts and more liquidity for the banking system. Beijing is attempting a difficult balancing act \u2013 trying to revive growth while also implementing structural reforms, and managing financial stability risk. China\u2019s property sector remains in a slump, with sales down sharply this year despite efforts to boost sentiment. And while cutting lending rates may provide some help, it will be difficult unless Chinese consumers feel confident enough to borrow \u2013 at a time where consumer confidence is near an all-time low\u2026.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve lived overseas for 12 years, the vast majority of my adult life. I visit Australia every year (global pandemics permitting) but I\u2019m no longer allowed to vote. I consider Melbourne my home town and brag about it relentlessly but my accent has become hopelessly mangled. And though my nationality is the first line of my standard bio \u2013 <em>Mikaella is an Australian writer based in Berlin</em> \u2013 it\u2019s rarely apparent in my actual writing.</p> <p>My fiction already has a strange, hybrid quality; I write novels with my wife, Onjuli Datta, our two voices twining around one another with more than a decade\u2019s worth of practice to create a shared language I step into as easily as my own. Onjuli is British, as is the heroine of our first novel, but, if we were taking turns, I skipped mine.</p> <p>Our second novel, Feast While You Can, takes place in an unnamed but clearly European country, in a fictional town of our own devising. And while there ares many of my qualities in our heroine Angelina \u2013 her brash ruthlessness, her gleeful lesbianism, a streak of optimism so vivid it becomes occasionally dangerous \u2013 my Australianess is not one of them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/07/gina-chick-alone-australia-winner-three-things-interview\">Three things with Gina Chick: \u2018I have many blades of various shape, size and degrees of lethality\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If in our first novel, the lack of Australia was an accident of plot (there is a passing mention of Sydney, like a hasty wave out the window for my homeland readers), in the second it was more deliberate. It felt wrong to write about an ancient and supernatural evil in Australia without engaging deeply and empathetically with Indigenous Australians, who have lived on this land for the past 65,000 years. I didn\u2019t feel equipped to write a story that draws from mythological monsters or the all-too-real monsters of invasion and colonisation, and it\u2019s not my story to tell.</p> <p>Writing fiction, a great job where you get to sit at your computer and make things up all day, demands a kernel of truth. If you\u2019re going to make lying your job, it warns, you\u2019d better be talking about something real. \u201cWrite what you know\u201d is a hoary chestnut of advice, so old and ubiquitous that it has suffered multiple waves of backlash (the science fiction writer Joe Haldeman called it \u201cthe reason there exist so many mediocre novels about English professors contemplating adultery\u201d).</p> <p>But it\u2019s good advice in any genre. A world doesn\u2019t have to be real for you to know it; a character\u2019s identity doesn\u2019t have to align absolutely with yours to see from their eyes.</p> <p>Similarly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to live in Australia to write beautifully and incisively about our country. Think about our expat classics (Shirley Hazzard, Christina Stead, Kate Jennings), our contemporary geniuses (Tara June Winch, Jessica Stanley). You don\u2019t have to hunt for Australian writers who have kept their connection taut so they write about Australia and Australians with joy, anger, humour, tenderness, sarcasm.</p> <p>There\u2019s an expat joke in Berlin that while the city is full of Australians, we tend to avoid one another. I always feel at my most Australian when I\u2019m the only Australian in a room. More and more, I sense that I\u2019m out of touch. My siblings use slang I don\u2019t know. I lose track of local politics. I mix up suburbs, streets, directions. I worry that I don\u2019t really remember Melbourne, only my favourite stories about it. Sometimes I tell an anecdote and then sit up late feverishly factchecking myself, scrolling Google Maps to find an old and beloved route.</p> <p>Writing anything is an exercise in vulnerability but the fear of writing Australia and getting it wrong, feeling it ring false or hollow, losing that sense of deep intimacy with character and place that the best writing offers, is also embarrassing and invalidating. If I can\u2019t write Australia, can I call myself Australian at all?</p> <p>I can\u2019t avoid writing about Australia forever \u2013 not least because my cowardice has become interesting to me. Australians are starting to crop up in my next projects, a perspective here, an idea there, a character who elbows her way into the narrative and demands a point of view. And I have hope, because in the last round of copy edits for Feast While You Can, I noticed something: in the way the characters talked, in the landscape that flickered behind our Italian mountains, in a community that drives you crazy and makes you fiercely protective at the same time, in a huge and sprawling family with their door always open. It was subtle but unmistakable. It was an Australian accent.</p> <p>\u2022 Mikaella Clements is an Australian writer based in Berlin<strong>. </strong>Her next novel co-written with Onjuli Datta, Feast While You Can, is published by Simon &amp; Schuster on 30 October</p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve lived overseas for 12 years, the vast majority of my adult life. I visit Australia every year (global pandemics permitting) but I\u2019m no longer allowed to vote. I consider Melbourne my home town and brag about it relentlessly but my accent has become hopelessly mangled. And though my nationality is the first line of my standard bio \u2013 Mikaella is an Australian writer based in Berlin \u2013 it\u2019s rarely apparent in my actual writing. My fiction already has a strange, hybrid quality; I write novels with my wife, Onjuli Datta, our two voices twining around one another with more than a decade\u2019s worth of practice to create a shared language I step into as easily as my own. Onjuli is British, as is the heroine of our first novel, but, if we were taking turns, I skipped mine. Our second novel, Feast While You Can, takes place in an unnamed but clearly European country, in a fictional town of our own devising. And while there ares many of my qualities in our heroine Angelina \u2013 her brash ruthlessness, her gleeful lesbianism, a streak of optimism so vivid it becomes occasionally dangerous \u2013 my Australianess is not one of them. If in our first novel, the lack of Australia was an accident of plot (there is a passing mention of Sydney, like a hasty wave out the window for my homeland readers), in the second it was more deliberate. It felt wrong to write about an ancient and supernatural evil in Australia without engaging deeply and empathetically with Indigenous Australians, who have lived on this land for the past 65,000 years. I didn\u2019t feel equipped to write a story that draws from mythological monsters or the all-too-real monsters of invasion and colonisation, and it\u2019s not my story to tell. Writing fiction, a great job where you get to sit at your computer and make things up all day, demands a kernel of truth. If you\u2019re going to make lying your job, it warns, you\u2019d better be talking about something real. \u201cWrite what you know\u201d is a hoary chestnut of advice, so old and ubiquitous that it has suffered multiple waves of backlash (the science fiction writer Joe Haldeman called it \u201cthe reason there exist so many mediocre novels about English professors contemplating adultery\u201d). But it\u2019s good advice in any genre. A world doesn\u2019t have to be real for you to know it; a character\u2019s identity doesn\u2019t have to align absolutely with yours to see from their eyes. Similarly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to live in Australia to write beautifully and incisively about our country. Think about our expat classics (Shirley Hazzard, Christina Stead, Kate Jennings), our contemporary geniuses (Tara June Winch, Jessica Stanley). You don\u2019t have to hunt for Australian writers who have kept their connection taut so they write about Australia and Australians with joy, anger, humour, tenderness, sarcasm. There\u2019s an expat joke in Berlin that while the city is full of Australians, we tend to avoid one another. I always feel at my most Australian when I\u2019m the only Australian in a room. More and more, I sense that I\u2019m out of touch. My siblings use slang I don\u2019t know. I lose track of local politics. I mix up suburbs, streets, directions. I worry that I don\u2019t really remember Melbourne, only my favourite stories about it. Sometimes I tell an anecdote and then sit up late feverishly factchecking myself, scrolling Google Maps to find an old and beloved route. Writing anything is an exercise in vulnerability but the fear of writing Australia and getting it wrong, feeling it ring false or hollow, losing that sense of deep intimacy with character and place that the best writing offers, is also embarrassing and invalidating. If I can\u2019t write Australia, can I call myself Australian at all? I can\u2019t avoid writing about Australia forever \u2013 not least because my cowardice has become interesting to me. Australians are starting to crop up in my next projects, a perspective here, an idea there, a character who elbows her way into the narrative and demands a point of view. And I have hope, because in the last round of copy edits for Feast While You Can, I noticed something: in the way the characters talked, in the landscape that flickered behind our Italian mountains, in a community that drives you crazy and makes you fiercely protective at the same time, in a huge and sprawling family with their door always open. It was subtle but unmistakable. It was an Australian accent. \u2022 Mikaella Clements is an Australian writer based in Berlin. Her next novel co-written with Onjuli Datta, Feast While You Can, is published by Simon &amp; Schuster on 30 October",

Having flown from Melbourne to Los Angeles with a vague interest in the rapper\u2019s antisemitic remarks, Safran \u2013 a Jewish Australian comedian-journalist with a history of outlandish stunts, often mentioned in the same breath as Louis Theroux and Jon Ronson \u2013 arrived outside one of West\u2019s properties, a mansion in Calabasas, California.

He calls this period \u201ca writer\u2019s retreat\u201d; others would just call it trespassing. Safran initially had no plans to squat in West\u2019s house \u2013 but, once he realises it is possible, the idea \u201cticks a lot of boxes when it comes to my personal interests: Nazis, hip-hop, book writing and snooping\u201d. After stocking up on camping gear, he treks to the property, slips in an unlocked door and spends a strange week trying to better understand West\u2019s psyche, all the while sleeping in the rapper\u2019s bed and raiding the pantry.</p>    <p>Safran isn\u2019t that worried about how West might react if or when he finds out a 52-year-old stranger from Australia squatted in his house and wrote a book about it. \u201cI just pray that he has bigger fish to fry,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s obviously something wrong with me that I do this stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Safran\u2019s glib summary of Squat makes sense if you\u2019re familiar with his shtick: \u201cKanye West had come out in support of Hitler and I\u2019m me.\u201d If you aren\u2019t, Safran has, in the name of good telly \u2013 and in the name of poking at cultural, political, religious and ethnic divides: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/16716504\">tried to join the Ku Klux Kla</a>; \u201cmarried\u201d a Muslim relative of Osama bin Laden; got crucified in the Philippines; wore blackface in the streets of Chicago; enlisted a Muslim cleric to put a fatwa on the Australian television host Rove McManus; and underwent an exorcism.</p> <p>We meet at Safran\u2019s synagogue in Melbourne, where he\u2019s finishing an irreverent shoot in his \u201cYe-mulke\u201d: a yarmulke made of an old Yeezy sneaker, West\u2019s former fashion line with Adidas. That collaboration ended when West\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/02/kanye-west-suspended-from-twitter-after-posting-swastika-inside-the-star-of-david\">multiple antisemitic outbursts</a> became too much for the label, as well as many other companies. West <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/28/kanye-west-claims-he-lost-2bn-in-one-day-amid-backlash-to-antisemitic-comments\">claimed his personal wealth crashed $2bn in a single day</a>. He<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/26/kanye-west-apologises-to-jewish-community-for-2022-antisemitic-remarks\"> subsequently apologised</a> \u201cto the Jewish community\u201d in Hebrew \u2013 then released a track stating that he couldn\u2019t be antisemitic because he once \u201cfucked a Jewish bitch\u201d.</p>    <p>But, as Safran points out, even this part of the story is knottier than it seems: the Adidas founders, Adolf and Rudolf Dassler, were members of the Nazi party and the company supplied shoes to the Wehrmacht before the factory was repurposed to make armaments.<strong> </strong>These are the \u201ctangles\u201d he likes, stories that are far more complicated than they first appear.<strong> </strong>\u201cAnother writer might think, \u2018God, I wish Kanye was white, as that would make it easier to write about him being racist,\u2019\u201d Safran says. \u201cI\u2019m the opposite \u2013 it is more interesting <em>because</em> he is Black.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>After Safran stashes the<strong> </strong>Ye-mulke in his car, we head across the road for coffee. The server recognises him immediately; <em> </em>he tells us that he works at the church across the road from Safran\u2019s synagogue.</p> <p>\u201cHey, if you\u2019d like to start a really exciting holy war,\u201d Safran says, leaning in conspiratorily. \u201cI know the rabbi.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s remarkable how outlandish some of Safran\u2019s efforts still are, 20 years on. Take the episode of John Safran\u2019s Race Relations, his TV series about dating across cultures: he visits an Israeli sperm bank to make a donation but gets his Palestinian boom mic operator to masturbate into the cup instead. He then travels to the West Bank to donate his own sperm \u2013 their shared <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuvvfnjgZlM\">attempt to create \u201cJalestinian\u201d children</a> who would, presumably, heal divides. It was shocking in 2009 and it is shocking now.</p>    <p>\u201cYou know, I blame society for me breaking into Kanye West\u2019s mansion,\u201d he says now, faux-serious. \u201cThe signs were there. You could have stopped me.\u201d</p> <p>Safran has been a hip-hop fan since childhood (\u201cI was possibly more into Public Enemy than the members of Public Enemy,\u201d he writes), but he only became interested in West after the antisemitic outbursts. Why would the biggest rapper in the world go on Alex Jones\u2019s show with a balaclava and a Bible to say \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that I love about Hitler\u201d? But Squat is about more than just West: it is also about the broader rise of antisemitism, the shared histories of Jewish Americans and Black Americans and also Safran\u2019s own Jewishness.</p> <p>While the book opens with a pro-Palestinian rally in Sydney, which Safran attended because <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-10/nsw-police-respond-rally-jewish-community-sydney-opera-house/102955090\">NSW police had advised Jews not to go</a>, Squat took shape long before Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel on 7 October and the war in Gaza. Safran has been attending rallies in Australia for the last year but he couldn\u2019t find a way to include this in Squat without it feeling \u201ctacked on\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to be interesting to have a book that\u2019s coming into this sideways \u2013 looking at identity and how people pressure you to [explain], why are you a Jew?\u201d he says.</p> <p>His week in West\u2019s mansion is not a fun one. He\u2019s unnerved by the decor, which includes a room containing a mysterious pile of human-sized ragdolls. He sleeps poorly, in the rapper\u2019s bed, and is terrified about being caught \u2013 by nosy neighbours, police or even West himself. He cooks up some old pasta using a bucket of rainwater.

      "bodyText": "How would you try to track down Kanye West? If you are John Safran, you just go to knock on his door. Having flown from Melbourne to Los Angeles with a vague interest in the rapper\u2019s antisemitic remarks, Safran \u2013 a Jewish Australian comedian-journalist with a history of outlandish stunts, often mentioned in the same breath as Louis Theroux and Jon Ronson \u2013 arrived outside one of West\u2019s properties, a mansion in Calabasas, California. He poked around until he found an old water bill addressed to West and, having gotten his bearings, set about meeting his neighbours. \u201cIs it fun living next to West?\u201d Safran asks Ernie across the road. \u201cNo, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d Ernie says, rattling off a laundry list of quibbles over planning permissions and cars blocking traffic. But Gregg doesn\u2019t mind him so much: West\u2019s people invited his family to one of his church services, which \u201cwas really, really nice\u201d. West hasn\u2019t been seen there for a while, it turns out \u2013 and neither have his security guards. This is the kernel of Safran\u2019s latest book, Squat, a freewheeling account of the week he spent squatting in West\u2019s mansion. He calls this period \u201ca writer\u2019s retreat\u201d; others would just call it trespassing. Safran initially had no plans to squat in West\u2019s house \u2013 but, once he realises it is possible, the idea \u201cticks a lot of boxes when it comes to my personal interests: Nazis, hip-hop, book writing and snooping\u201d. After stocking up on camping gear, he treks to the property, slips in an unlocked door and spends a strange week trying to better understand West\u2019s psyche, all the while sleeping in the rapper\u2019s bed and raiding the pantry. Safran isn\u2019t that worried about how West might react if or when he finds out a 52-year-old stranger from Australia squatted in his house and wrote a book about it. \u201cI just pray that he has bigger fish to fry,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s obviously something wrong with me that I do this stuff.\u201d Safran\u2019s glib summary of Squat makes sense if you\u2019re familiar with his shtick: \u201cKanye West had come out in support of Hitler and I\u2019m me.\u201d If you aren\u2019t, Safran has, in the name of good telly \u2013 and in the name of poking at cultural, political, religious and ethnic divides: tried to join the Ku Klux Kla; \u201cmarried\u201d a Muslim relative of Osama bin Laden; got crucified in the Philippines; wore blackface in the streets of Chicago; enlisted a Muslim cleric to put a fatwa on the Australian television host Rove McManus; and underwent an exorcism. We meet at Safran\u2019s synagogue in Melbourne, where he\u2019s finishing an irreverent shoot in his \u201cYe-mulke\u201d: a yarmulke made of an old Yeezy sneaker, West\u2019s former fashion line with Adidas. That collaboration ended when West\u2019s multiple antisemitic outbursts became too much for the label, as well as many other companies. West claimed his personal wealth crashed $2bn in a single day. He subsequently apologised \u201cto the Jewish community\u201d in Hebrew \u2013 then released a track stating that he couldn\u2019t be antisemitic because he once \u201cfucked a Jewish bitch\u201d. But, as Safran points out, even this part of the story is knottier than it seems: the Adidas founders, Adolf and Rudolf Dassler, were members of the Nazi party and the company supplied shoes to the Wehrmacht before the factory was repurposed to make armaments. These are the \u201ctangles\u201d he likes, stories that are far more complicated than they first appear. \u201cAnother writer might think, \u2018God, I wish Kanye was white, as that would make it easier to write about him being racist,\u2019\u201d Safran says. \u201cI\u2019m the opposite \u2013 it is more interesting because he is Black.\u201d *** After Safran stashes the Ye-mulke in his car, we head across the road for coffee. The server recognises him immediately; he tells us that he works at the church across the road from Safran\u2019s synagogue. \u201cHey, if you\u2019d like to start a really exciting holy war,\u201d Safran says, leaning in conspiratorily. \u201cI know the rabbi.\u201d It\u2019s remarkable how outlandish some of Safran\u2019s efforts still are, 20 years on. Take the episode of John Safran\u2019s Race Relations, his TV series about dating across cultures: he visits an Israeli sperm bank to make a donation but gets his Palestinian boom mic operator to masturbate into the cup instead. He then travels to the West Bank to donate his own sperm \u2013 their shared attempt to create \u201cJalestinian\u201d children who would, presumably, heal divides. It was shocking in 2009 and it is shocking now. \u201cYou know, I blame society for me breaking into Kanye West\u2019s mansion,\u201d he says now, faux-serious. \u201cThe signs were there. You could have stopped me.\u201d Safran has been a hip-hop fan since childhood (\u201cI was possibly more into Public Enemy than the members of Public Enemy,\u201d he writes), but he only became interested in West after the antisemitic outbursts. Why would the biggest rapper in the world go on Alex Jones\u2019s show with a balaclava and a Bible to say \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that I love about Hitler\u201d? But Squat is about more than just West: it is also about the broader rise of antisemitism, the shared histories of Jewish Americans and Black Americans and also Safran\u2019s own Jewishness. While the book opens with a pro-Palestinian rally in Sydney, which Safran attended because NSW police had advised Jews not to go, Squat took shape long before Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel on 7 October and the war in Gaza. Safran has been attending rallies in Australia for the last year but he couldn\u2019t find a way to include this in Squat without it feeling \u201ctacked on\u201d. \u201cIt is going to be interesting to have a book that\u2019s coming into this sideways \u2013 looking at identity and how people pressure you to [explain], why are you a Jew?\u201d he says. His week in West\u2019s mansion is not a fun one. He\u2019s unnerved by the decor, which includes a room containing a mysterious pile of human-sized ragdolls. He sleeps poorly, in the rapper\u2019s bed, and is terrified about being caught \u2013 by nosy neighbours, police or even West himself. He cooks up some old pasta using a bucket of rainwater. (That water bill he found? Unpaid.) He starts accidentally injuring himself in weird ways until his exhausted brain decides he\u2019s cursed. \u201cAm I no longer the guy who interviews the cranks?\u201d he frets. \u201cHave I become the crank?\u201d There is a sense that maybe Safran\u2019s weird line of work is finally getting to him. \u201cI realise I\u2019d be short-changing myself if I justified this trespassing as nihilistic thrill-seeking,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf I wanted that, I\u2019d train surf. No. Kanye is playing with my family story for his art.\u201d *** Safran grew up in a culturally Jewish home in Melbourne.

Wayne Coco Wharton was in the Australian capital on Monday for what he called a day of resistance against the visit, and calling for the acknowledgment of massacres and violent dispossession in Canberra. Wharton said he wanted to give the king an international criminal court notice for genocidal crimes but said he had been barred from getting close to the monarch. \u201cThis is resistance,\u201d he said, calling himself \u201can adversary on behalf of sovereign nations\u201d. \u201cI tried to explain to the authorities, I was trying to serve a document on the king of England,\u201d the Kooma man told Guardian Australia. He said Britain had failed to acknowledge the country\u2019s history and its legacy. \u201cAll the advantage, all the wealth \u2026 is through the direct results of massacres, wars and genocide of First Nations people.\u201d Thorpe \u2013 a Gunnai, Gunditjmara and Djab Wurrung woman \u2013 said in a statement she had met and was supported by traditional owners and that she had backing from First Nations people around the country. \u201cThis morning before the event in Parliament, I met with and was supported by Ngambri Ngunnawal Traditional Custodians from that Country, and I have the support from Blak Sovereign Movement Elders from around the whole country,\u201d she said. \u201cI take the lead from the Blak Sovereign Movement. \u201cThe King is not our Sovereign, he\u2019s not our King. I have been requesting meetings with him, but was ignored. Today I felt it was right to speak up on behalf and the Blak Sovereign Movement to call out genocide and the invasion and theft of our lands, waters and skies by the Crown.\u201d",

According to Tony Barry, a former senior Liberal staffer who is now a director at the political consultancy outfit RedBridge, even older voters are increasingly voicing concerns about housing affordability, expressing unprompted in focus groups a desire for their children and grandchildren to live nearby. \u201cHousing attainability is the great political faultline in Australian politics and every political party\u2019s response needs to be carefully calibrated or voters will see right through it because of its salience as an issue,\u201d Barry said. So far, he said, Labor had been able to wedge the Liberal party on the issue. The former Labor campaigner and Socially Democratic podcast host Stephen Donnelly said Allan\u2019s announcement was both \u201cgood public policy and smart politics\u201d. \u201cDo the Liberals embrace Labor\u2019s plan for higher-density housing around transport hubs \u2013 which is what a whole generation of Melburnians locked out of the market are desperate for \u2013 or do they keep taking the path of protecting the status quo?\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>It is a weekday afternoon and I am at a pilates studio on Sydney\u2019s north shore, face contorted and limbs asunder, staring down my impending demise. An abhorrently cheerful voice radiates from a screen at the front of the room: \u201cYou got this!\u201d I grunt in response.</p> <p>If you live anywhere within 30km of a Lululemon, you might be familiar with the epidemic known as reformer pilates: an exercise where lithe people in matching sets mount a machine halfway between a bondage device and a medieval pillory to spend the better part of an hour performing increasingly excruciating positions in springs and straps.</p> <p>But something is different about the studio I am at. It is called Pronto, it is one of 15 branches across Australia (including three that opened in Sydney this year), and it prides itself on being teacher-less: instead of following a human instructor, members swipe in for a 45-minute virtual session featuring pre-recorded demonstrations by a digital teacher. The lesson is beamed from TVs dotted around the room; there are eight reformer machines all up and, unlike a traditional studio, no mirrors.<strong> </strong></p> <p>It is the only studio I have encountered to do away with live instructors.<strong> </strong>What it lacks in personalised attention it promises to make up for with a vaguely futuristic vision of exercise and a sharp price drop. Classes here average out to between $5 and $11<strong> </strong>while<strong> </strong> human-led studios can cost anywhere from $15 to $35 a class, depending on the length and frequency of membership.<strong> </strong>Is the trade-off worth it?<strong> </strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul>    <p>Last time I was on one of these machines my entire body caved into a gap and I had to be physically rescued by the instructor. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! This happens so often!\u201d she said, in the same tone you might use to lie about Santa to a child. That was six months ago. Now there is no instructor to save me. If I fall I may well be trapped in the reformer like a dazed cockroach. </p> <p>We begin simply enough: with a warm-up stretch. Because I am so brave, I will admit that I cannot touch my toes \u2013 an existential failing that some have attributed to my disproportionately long legs. \u201cI want you to follow my voice,\u201d the virtual teacher intones. I am listening. I am poised. I am resting my hands on my shins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/30/burlesque-dancing-classes-australia-review-evana-de-lune-jennifer-wong-comedian\">My first time at a burlesque class: \u2018Could I thrust with a force that could kill a man?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I move on to the reformer. Instantly, the soundtrack transitions from a mellow muzak to tropical house. I feel as though I am in an episode of Love Island or maybe a YouTube video circa 2012. Unfortunately I am in neither of these things. I am in pain because I have been doing stomach crunches for the past 10,000 millennia (30 seconds) and now I am being told to pulse.</p> <p>There is a soothing quality to the digital instructor\u2019s voice, like an early childhood educator or a cult leader. It is almost hypnotic. I could see myself appreciating the timbre if I was five years old or someone with a weak spiritual constitution. Instead I am a person who wants defined calves \u2013 which is how I find myself suddenly supine, legs burning as I press my body in and out from the machine. </p> <p>I know my form is less than ideal. By this time in a regular session I\u2019d be lolling and panting dramatically. \u201cPlease,\u201d I would telegraph with my eyes. \u201cCome and adjust my sweaty limbs so I may continue through this class without getting a hernia.\u201d Here though, I only have myself to blame. \u201cCan you lift your heels any higher?\u201d the virtual voice practically beams. \u201cNo!!!\u201d I scream silently. \u201cThat looks great!\u201d she says, without missing a beat. I am probably risking an injury but at least I am getting a compliment. It is a Faustian bargain I am willing to take.</p>    <p>Thirty minutes in, and the unrelenting praise has worn me down.<strong> </strong>I can feel myself submitting to the digital instructor\u2019s unbridled cheer. \u201cGet closer to your knees!\u201d Yes, master. \u201cHold for four!\u201d Certainly, your excellency. \u201cYou got this!\u201d Thank you, my liege.</p> <p>Midway through a shoulder set, arms extended in exaltation, I start thinking back to each of the pilates teachers who have shaped me: the one who played only Phoebe Bridgers remixes; the one who kept misusing the word \u201cyummy\u201d to mean \u201cagonising\u201d; the one who I saw at a party but didn\u2019t recognise me so we simply stared at each other while opening and closing our mouths like goldfish.</p>    <p>Slowly, these memories begin fading away. All that remains are the virtual instructor\u2019s directives. I entered this class supposing that, without supervision, I could sneak in a break or two. But \u2013 much like the beep test \u2013 the digital voice is the voice of God. I find myself desperate to impress this stupid, anonymous screen.</p> <p>The class ends the same way it opened: with a stretch. I bend a little deeper until my legs might snap like taffy. I am a broken man. But I am also cash-strapped and masochistic. On the way home, I book into another session. </p> <ul> <li><p><em>Michael Sun </em><em>was a guest of Pronto</em></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "It is a weekday afternoon and I am at a pilates studio on Sydney\u2019s north shore, face contorted and limbs asunder, staring down my impending demise. An abhorrently cheerful voice radiates from a screen at the front of the room: \u201cYou got this!\u201d I grunt in response. If you live anywhere within 30km of a Lululemon, you might be familiar with the epidemic known as reformer pilates: an exercise where lithe people in matching sets mount a machine halfway between a bondage device and a medieval pillory to spend the better part of an hour performing increasingly excruciating positions in springs and straps. But something is different about the studio I am at. It is called Pronto, it is one of 15 branches across Australia (including three that opened in Sydney this year), and it prides itself on being teacher-less: instead of following a human instructor, members swipe in for a 45-minute virtual session featuring pre-recorded demonstrations by a digital teacher. The lesson is beamed from TVs dotted around the room; there are eight reformer machines all up and, unlike a traditional studio, no mirrors. It is the only studio I have encountered to do away with live instructors. What it lacks in personalised attention it promises to make up for with a vaguely futuristic vision of exercise and a sharp price drop. Classes here average out to between $5 and $11 while human-led studios can cost anywhere from $15 to $35 a class, depending on the length and frequency of membership. Is the trade-off worth it? Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Last time I was on one of these machines my entire body caved into a gap and I had to be physically rescued by the instructor. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! This happens so often!\u201d she said, in the same tone you might use to lie about Santa to a child. That was six months ago. Now there is no instructor to save me. If I fall I may well be trapped in the reformer like a dazed cockroach. We begin simply enough: with a warm-up stretch. Because I am so brave, I will admit that I cannot touch my toes \u2013 an existential failing that some have attributed to my disproportionately long legs. \u201cI want you to follow my voice,\u201d the virtual teacher intones. I am listening. I am poised. I am resting my hands on my shins. I move on to the reformer. Instantly, the soundtrack transitions from a mellow muzak to tropical house. I feel as though I am in an episode of Love Island or maybe a YouTube video circa 2012. Unfortunately I am in neither of these things. I am in pain because I have been doing stomach crunches for the past 10,000 millennia (30 seconds) and now I am being told to pulse. There is a soothing quality to the digital instructor\u2019s voice, like an early childhood educator or a cult leader. It is almost hypnotic. I could see myself appreciating the timbre if I was five years old or someone with a weak spiritual constitution. Instead I am a person who wants defined calves \u2013 which is how I find myself suddenly supine, legs burning as I press my body in and out from the machine. I know my form is less than ideal. By this time in a regular session I\u2019d be lolling and panting dramatically. \u201cPlease,\u201d I would telegraph with my eyes. \u201cCome and adjust my sweaty limbs so I may continue through this class without getting a hernia.\u201d Here though, I only have myself to blame. \u201cCan you lift your heels any higher?\u201d the virtual voice practically beams. \u201cNo!!!\u201d I scream silently. \u201cThat looks great!\u201d she says, without missing a beat. I am probably risking an injury but at least I am getting a compliment. It is a Faustian bargain I am willing to take. Thirty minutes in, and the unrelenting praise has worn me down. I can feel myself submitting to the digital instructor\u2019s unbridled cheer. \u201cGet closer to your knees!\u201d Yes, master. \u201cHold for four!\u201d Certainly, your excellency. \u201cYou got this!\u201d Thank you, my liege. Midway through a shoulder set, arms extended in exaltation, I start thinking back to each of the pilates teachers who have shaped me: the one who played only Phoebe Bridgers remixes; the one who kept misusing the word \u201cyummy\u201d to mean \u201cagonising\u201d; the one who I saw at a party but didn\u2019t recognise me so we simply stared at each other while opening and closing our mouths like goldfish. Slowly, these memories begin fading away. All that remains are the virtual instructor\u2019s directives. I entered this class supposing that, without supervision, I could sneak in a break or two. But \u2013 much like the beep test \u2013 the digital voice is the voice of God. I find myself desperate to impress this stupid, anonymous screen. The class ends the same way it opened: with a stretch. I bend a little deeper until my legs might snap like taffy. I am a broken man. But I am also cash-strapped and masochistic. On the way home, I book into another session. Michael Sun was a guest of Pronto",

His relationship with the Gallagher brothers stretches back to 1993, when Oasis supported the Verve on tour prior to the release of their debut single Supersonic. The Verve later supported Oasis, and in the liner notes of (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory, Cast No Shadow \u201cis dedicated to the genius of Richard Ashcroft\u201d. Ashcroft can \u2013 barely \u2013 be heard singing backing vocals on maximalist nine-minute Oasis epic All Around the World, from 1997\u2019s Be Here Now. Later, Liam Gallagher appeared on a version of Ashcroft\u2019s single C\u2019mon People (We\u2019re Making It Now), recorded for 2021 acoustic album Acoustic Hymns Vol 1.",

I\u2019m not here to shake a narrative, or to swing a seat, I believe I can win. \u201cYou need someone with an accent in Canberra. You need someone with dark skin, an immigrant, someone from a minority, who is independent and can speak freely, in Canberra, representing this area.\u201d Ouf is the second independent to declare candidacy for a Labor seat in western Sydney after Dr Ziad Basyouny announced he would challenge Tony Burke for Watson. Blaxland, just like Watson, is a safe Labor seat, held by the party since its inception in 1949 and most famously represented by the former prime minister Paul Keating from 1969 to 1996. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email It includes Bankstown, Auburn, Lidcombe and South Granville, historically working-class suburbs which now have large migrant communitiesincluding Lebanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and Nepalese residents. Jason Clare, the education minister, has held the seat since 2007 and won nearly 65% of the vote in 2022 but Ouf believes it\u2019s the kind of seat Labor is going to lose soon. \u201cLabor\u2019s time in western Sydney has run out. And if they can\u2019t see it, they are delusional.\u201d Ouf, a 45-year-old pharmacist and immigrant from Egypt, decided to run for council as an independent after finding no local swimming facilities for his disabled son. He says the local area lacks the amenities its residents need, a sentiment he claims is echoed by the many customers at his pharmacy, which is in the heart of Auburn. And he says there is enough anger with Clare that an independent could defeat him. \u201cThey would tell me they didn\u2019t know their local members or councillors, and that we needed so much help. Our unemployment rate is sky high, our young people have no support, and the cost of living bites here more than anywhere else. \u201cThis area has not grown in the past 10 years, we have seen no progress. Where are the services and infrastructure? Where are the new schools? Where are the projects and initiatives? We have been ignored here.\u201d His confidence comes from his success in the council elections, where he attracted more votes than Labor in the South Granville ward. He says he has built a team of \u201clocal community experts\u201d who helped propel him over the line, alongside a base of more than 180 volunteers. \u201cWe are well prepared for the next election, we already have a team and system in place. We know what we need to do, because we already did it.\u201d Ouf says his victory in the council election was built on \u201cdoor-knocking and grassroots engagement\u201d. \u201cWe worked all hours of the day, talking to people, handing out flyers, putting up posters. We have a well-oiled machine and it is ready to go again.\u201d His challenge comes as Labor faces increasing pressure in similar seats amid frustration at its response to the war in Gaza. Ouf says the Middle East conflict was a personal \u201cturning point\u201d but is just one part of his \u201cmulti-issue\u201d campaign which also includes the cost of living, housing affordability, education and healthcare. \u201cPalestine is just one of maybe 10 triggers for the local community here. There is frustration and anger at this but it won\u2019t win the election alone. We are focused on local issues.\u201d The Muslim Vote, a grassroots organisation aiming to topple Labor ministers, was approached by Guardian Australia for comment and says it welcomes Ouf\u2019s candidacy. Ben Raue, an electoral analyst, says Ouf\u2019s success at council level makes him \u201cdefinitely someone to watch\u201d and shows he has a winning election machine. \u201cJust having a machine of supporters is something you can build on, and he does seem to be the right kind of candidate to challenge for Blaxland,\u201d Raue says. \u201cHe did very well in the council election, and that reflects well on his team, but ultimately, a federal seat is much bigger than a council ward \u2026 \u201cClearly, there\u2019s a moment right now where Labor is a bit vulnerable, and this is an interesting test case. \u201cPolitics changes over time, and new groups pop up. And I think this is a moment where, say it\u2019s like Blaxland or Watson are the ones worth watching.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Those of us looking for signs of the end of television will surely have seen the grim news this weekend that ITV plans to generate new ideas for television shows using artificial intelligence. According to the Telegraph, the broadcaster is willing to pay someone \u00a395,000 a year to get AI to come up with \u201cTV shows, films and digital-first content\u201d.</p> <p>Which does sound a death knell, doesn\u2019t it? For a while now, broadcasters around the world have coveted AI as a cheap way of creating entertainment \u2013 in fact, much of last year\u2019s Writers Guild of America strike revolved around seeking assurances that commissioners wouldn\u2019t just hop on ChatGPT and churn out hundreds of scripts. But ITV has become one of the first to stick its head above the parapet and declare that it is actually going to do it.</p> <p>Obviously, the response to this has been instant and brutal. Jack Rooke, creator of Big Boys, has said: \u201cITV are neglecting to realise their most successful scripted projects have always been born out of real-life human experience \u2026 ITV and their channel executives should be further investing in creative writing talent to continue developing mainstream stories for audiences, as opposed to cost-cutting in dehumanising ways.\u201d Meanwhile, Lisa McGee, creator of Derry Girls, called the move \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cincredibly depressing\u201d, and Liam Williams of Ladhood urged writers to join a union to protect themselves against advances like this.</p>    <p>But aside from the people who stand to lose their livelihoods, it\u2019s just depressing for viewers, isn\u2019t it? We live in a world that\u2019s filled to the brim with high-quality entertainment. Given the choice between every great show ever made and some derivative half-baked format that\u2019s been burped out by a computer, you\u2019re always going to pick the former, aren\u2019t you?</p> <p>Great art \u2013 art made by humans \u2013 evolves. Look at television 70 years ago, then look at it now. It\u2019s completely different, and that is thanks to writers and directors and creatives constantly, subtly nudging at the peripheries of the form. The history of television is a history of experiments. The ones that succeed help to change the entire medium. By its very nature, AI cannot do this. All AI does is chew up and vomit back an amalgam of existing work. While the use of artificial intelligence might be an experiment, the content it comes up with is anything but. It\u2019s a mushed-up mixture of everything that came before it. Using AI to create new show ideas might be cheap, but it seems like the quickest way for the medium to stagnate to death.</p> <p>That said, AI might actually be considered a minor step up from ITV\u2019s idea-generating format at the moment, which appears to be some sort of elaborate tombola system. Tomorrow, for example, it is broadcasting shows about a TikToker doing challenges with her dad and an hour-long advertorial for Marks &amp; Spencer so transparent that the shop\u2019s name is in the title. If this is the best it can do, perhaps getting ChatGPT in the game wouldn\u2019t be too bad.</p> <p>In fact, you know what? I just did it now. I asked ChatGPT to come up with three new ITV travelogue ideas, and it gave me:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Uncharted Isles With </strong><strong>Joe Lycett</strong>: \u201cJoe could try his hand at traditional Faroese activities, like sheep herding and rowing in traditional boats, all while weaving in his trademark humour\u201d;</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hidden Trails With </strong><strong>Emilia Fox</strong>: \u201cEmilia Fox, with her calm, intellectual presence, would explore the ancient, mountainous region of Svaneti in Georgia\u201d;</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lost Highways With </strong><strong>Reggie Yates</strong>: \u201cReggie Yates is no stranger to confronting challenging topics and unusual destinations, so he would be an ideal choice to visit the strange, alien-like landscapes of Socotra, Yemen.</p></li> </ul> <p>Maybe you want gameshows? I asked ChatGPT and it came up with:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Shop\u2019n\u2019Swap With </strong><strong>Scarlett Moffatt</strong>: \u201cThe contestants\u2019 challenge is to head into a bustling marketplace or car boot sale to trade, swap or bargain their way to amassing the most valuable collection by the end of the show\u201d;</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mind the Gap </strong><strong>With </strong><strong>Natalie Cassidy</strong>: \u201cA fast-paced trivia and puzzle show set in a fictional train station.\u201d</p></li> </ul> <p>You\u2019d watch that, right?

The second question, Fujitsu were well aware of why we were requesting lots and lots of data for [financial] redress.

      "bodyText": "Fujitsu has begun forcing the Post Office to disclose whether Horizon data requests will be used to investigate a branch owner-operator for \u201cany impropriety\u201d, prompting objections from the state-owned body\u2019s executives. The development emerged in documents shown to the public inquiry into how hundreds of branch owner-operators were wrongfully pursued through the courts based on evidence from Horizon that was later found to be unreliable. The documents show that Fujitsu \u2013 which developed the IT system, still runs it for the Post Office and controls access to all transactional records from branches \u2013 added two new questions to its data request form in May. The inquiry heard last week that Fujitsu made it a mandatory, non-negotiable requirement for the Post Office to provide the additional information when making a request for audit record query (ARQ) data. The first question, at the start of the form, asked whether the use of the data would be \u201crelated to the investigation of, or action taken or intended to be taken, by the Post Office against a postmaster or post office worker in connection with potential fraud, theft, breach of contract or any other impropriety which is suspected to have occurred at relevant post office branches\u201d. The second question asked whether the data would be used to help a branch owner-operator or post office worker achieve financial redress through one of the compensation schemes being run by Post Office and the government. The counsel for the inquiry asked Simon Oldnall, the branch technology director responsible for the IT systems at the Post Office, about the Post Office\u2019s opposition to the new questions. \u201cFujitsu effectively unilaterally imposed these questions on the Post Office,\u201d Oldnall said. \u201cWe felt particularly the first question was very, very broad. The second question, Fujitsu were well aware of why we were requesting lots and lots of data for [financial] redress. Overall we didn\u2019t think the mandatory changes were necessary.\u201d Asked by counsel what the Post Office found so objectionable about the questions, Oldnall said: \u201cThe Post Office doesn\u2019t take action against postmasters, so it doesn\u2019t really stand even as a question. It felt very broadly worded and not relevant to how Post Office operates today.\u201d The enforced change instituted by Fujitsu came at the same time as a spat between the Post Office and the software company over the use of IT data to support a criminal case against a post office owner. The issue was rapidly escalated to Paul Patterson, the chief executive of Fujitsu Europe, who wrote directly to the Post Office chief executive, Nick Read. Patterson wrote in May this year that he had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the Post Office continuing to pursue enforcement against branch operators \u201cand expects Fujitsu to support such actions\u201d. Read responded that there had been a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d and that the contact had been to prompt Fujitsu to cooperate with a police investigation. Patterson said that the nature of how the request had been made by the investigations team had been \u201centirely inappropriate\u201d, and said the Post Office continued to have \u201csignificant cultural issues\u201d. It has also emerged that the Post Office is exploring an eventual resumption of the practice of taking branch owner-operators to court for the civil recovery of losses. On Tuesday last week, the inquiry was shown another document, titled Loss Recovery Update, from this summer. Under the \u201coptions and recommendations\u201d section, the Post Office highlighted the \u201csignificant financial risk\u201d of continuing to write off shortfalls in branches instead of pursuing them. It also said that the current practice of not pursuing a shortfall unless a post office operator is in agreement could lead to \u201can environment likely to embed improper financial behaviours/practices in the network of postmasters, if there is no sanction or consequence for failing to follow the proper policies or procedures\u201d. Horizon data would be required to pursue financial shortfalls from post office operators. Oldnall, who said he was aware of the document and of the \u201cactivity\u201d around a change in loss recovery strategy, said that in order for data to be used for such purposes he would have to \u201ccommission a piece of work\u201d internally. The inquiry will break this week and next, but will continue hearing evidence from Monday 4 November.",

      "body": "<p>As a singer-songwriter who was as devoted to social change as she was to her craft, Barbara Dane, who has died aged 97, is a singularly inspiring figure in American music. Amid a crop of reissues and a new film, I spoke to her just last week over the phone as she was cared for in a home hospice in Oakland, California, due to heart disease. As a singer, songwriter and activist over almost 80 years, finding kinship with everyone from Bob Dylan to Louis Armstrong, she demonstrated formidable quantities of courage and compassion, as documented in that new film, The 9 Lives of Barbara Dane.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the end,\u201d Dane said when I tentatively asked how she is. \u201cI struggle to breathe. My time ain\u2019t long.\u201d In US folk and blues circles, Dane was venerated for breaking down racial and gender barriers and never compromising. \u201cShe\u2019s always been a role model and a hero of mine \u2013 musically and politically,\u201d Bonnie Raitt, one of Dane\u2019s many famous admirers, has said. A Dylan blurb graces the cover of her 2022 autobiography: \u201cBarbara is someone who is willing to follow her conscience. She is, if the term must be used, a hero.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0YrT_KDIxo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T0YrT_KDIxo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>In the UK, her star is rather lower: she is best known for Northern soul anthem I\u2019m on My Way, recently reissued as a 7in. Dane made the 1960 recording with industry mavericks Lee Hazlewood and Lester Sill. \u201cIt was very straightforward,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I heard the finished record, he\u2019d gone and added horns and transformed it into a dance tune. It got me some airplay but I never gave it much thought until I heard how crazy they were for it in England. Then Samsung used it to soundtrack a commercial and I got paid royalties for the first time \u2013 Lee and Lester never paid me royalties.\u201d</p> <p>Dane was born and raised in Detroit, the eldest child of a pharmacist who publicly admonished nine-year-old Barbara for serving a soda to a Black man in his drugstore. The humiliation of her and the customer set Dane on a lifelong path fighting racism and injustice. A teenage communist, she began singing folk, then blues (\u201cfemale blues singers wrote and sang about their lives with such feeling and directness\u201d). In her remarkable autobiography, This Bell Still Rings: My Life of Defiance and Song, Dane recalls encounters with Woody Guthrie, Big Bill Broonzy, Pete Seeger, Earl Hines, Jack Teagarden, Count Basie, to name but a few.</p>    <p>Dane released her debut album, Trouble In Mind, in 1957 \u2013 \u201cBessie Smith in stereo\u201d declared British jazz critic Leonard Feather \u2013 and, in 1959, Louis Armstrong, having shared the stage with her, invited Barbara to join him on a TV special. \u201cDid you get that chick? She\u2019s a gasser!\u201d Armstrong would declare to Time magazine.</p> <p>Relocating to New York City made Dane the unintentional godmother of Greenwich Village\u2019s burgeoning folk scene. Inevitably, she befriended Dylan: \u201cHe used to turn up on stage uninvited when I was singing!\u201d she said. Dylan would play her his new songs, \u201can enormous talent hidden inside an endearing young scallywag\u201d. An actor plays Dane in forthcoming Dylan biopic<strong> </strong>A Complete Unknown but she disdains celebrity. \u201cBob was hungry for fame and that never interested me.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Dane focused on activism: vocal in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements. In 1966, she was one of the first US artists to tour post-revolutionary Cuba, then sang in North Vietnam as the war raged. All the while Dane continued to champion Black artists, recording with Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins then launching psych-soul band the Chambers Brothers at Newport folk festival: the 1966 album Barbara Dane and the Chambers Brothers is possibly the first US album cover to feature a white woman and Black men as equals.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chambers Brothers were great talents,\u201d Dane said. \u201cEarly on in LA, I suggested they join me in Mississippi singing freedom songs for the movement but, as they were originally from Mississippi, there was no way they were going back there. A wise decision on their part.\u201d</p>    <p>While many of her contemporaries went on to earn fortunes, Dane slipped into the shadows of American music. Partly this was due to her contempt for the music industry \u2013 she turned down Albert Grossman, powerhouse manager of Dylan, when he emphasised she should leave politics behind. Her love of vintage blues and trad jazz made Dane appear old fashioned once rock dominated. She also admits to self-sabotaging: in 1960, when both Capitol and Atlantic offered her deals, she opted for Capitol, so missing out on joining America\u2019s then premier blues and jazz label. Appearances singing on hugely popular TV variety shows hosted by Ed Sullivan and Johnny Carson went awry.

      "bodyText": "As a singer-songwriter who was as devoted to social change as she was to her craft, Barbara Dane, who has died aged 97, is a singularly inspiring figure in American music. Amid a crop of reissues and a new film, I spoke to her just last week over the phone as she was cared for in a home hospice in Oakland, California, due to heart disease. As a singer, songwriter and activist over almost 80 years, finding kinship with everyone from Bob Dylan to Louis Armstrong, she demonstrated formidable quantities of courage and compassion, as documented in that new film, The 9 Lives of Barbara Dane. \u201cThis is the end,\u201d Dane said when I tentatively asked how she is. \u201cI struggle to breathe. My time ain\u2019t long.\u201d In US folk and blues circles, Dane was venerated for breaking down racial and gender barriers and never compromising. \u201cShe\u2019s always been a role model and a hero of mine \u2013 musically and politically,\u201d Bonnie Raitt, one of Dane\u2019s many famous admirers, has said. A Dylan blurb graces the cover of her 2022 autobiography: \u201cBarbara is someone who is willing to follow her conscience. She is, if the term must be used, a hero.\u201d In the UK, her star is rather lower: she is best known for Northern soul anthem I\u2019m on My Way, recently reissued as a 7in. Dane made the 1960 recording with industry mavericks Lee Hazlewood and Lester Sill. \u201cIt was very straightforward,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I heard the finished record, he\u2019d gone and added horns and transformed it into a dance tune. It got me some airplay but I never gave it much thought until I heard how crazy they were for it in England. Then Samsung used it to soundtrack a commercial and I got paid royalties for the first time \u2013 Lee and Lester never paid me royalties.\u201d Dane was born and raised in Detroit, the eldest child of a pharmacist who publicly admonished nine-year-old Barbara for serving a soda to a Black man in his drugstore. The humiliation of her and the customer set Dane on a lifelong path fighting racism and injustice. A teenage communist, she began singing folk, then blues (\u201cfemale blues singers wrote and sang about their lives with such feeling and directness\u201d). In her remarkable autobiography, This Bell Still Rings: My Life of Defiance and Song, Dane recalls encounters with Woody Guthrie, Big Bill Broonzy, Pete Seeger, Earl Hines, Jack Teagarden, Count Basie, to name but a few. Dane released her debut album, Trouble In Mind, in 1957 \u2013 \u201cBessie Smith in stereo\u201d declared British jazz critic Leonard Feather \u2013 and, in 1959, Louis Armstrong, having shared the stage with her, invited Barbara to join him on a TV special. \u201cDid you get that chick? She\u2019s a gasser!\u201d Armstrong would declare to Time magazine. Relocating to New York City made Dane the unintentional godmother of Greenwich Village\u2019s burgeoning folk scene. Inevitably, she befriended Dylan: \u201cHe used to turn up on stage uninvited when I was singing!\u201d she said. Dylan would play her his new songs, \u201can enormous talent hidden inside an endearing young scallywag\u201d. An actor plays Dane in forthcoming Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown but she disdains celebrity. \u201cBob was hungry for fame and that never interested me.\u201d Instead, Dane focused on activism: vocal in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements. In 1966, she was one of the first US artists to tour post-revolutionary Cuba, then sang in North Vietnam as the war raged. All the while Dane continued to champion Black artists, recording with Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins then launching psych-soul band the Chambers Brothers at Newport folk festival: the 1966 album Barbara Dane and the Chambers Brothers is possibly the first US album cover to feature a white woman and Black men as equals. \u201cThe Chambers Brothers were great talents,\u201d Dane said. \u201cEarly on in LA, I suggested they join me in Mississippi singing freedom songs for the movement but, as they were originally from Mississippi, there was no way they were going back there. A wise decision on their part.\u201d While many of her contemporaries went on to earn fortunes, Dane slipped into the shadows of American music. Partly this was due to her contempt for the music industry \u2013 she turned down Albert Grossman, powerhouse manager of Dylan, when he emphasised she should leave politics behind. Her love of vintage blues and trad jazz made Dane appear old fashioned once rock dominated. She also admits to self-sabotaging: in 1960, when both Capitol and Atlantic offered her deals, she opted for Capitol, so missing out on joining America\u2019s then premier blues and jazz label. Appearances singing on hugely popular TV variety shows hosted by Ed Sullivan and Johnny Carson went awry. Her political beliefs meant Dane was blacklisted by the Hootenanny folk TV show, then bumped off goodwill tours with Armstrong and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee by the state department. \u201cHaving a brassy blond woman openly criticising the USA all over Africa, Asia and Europe was never going to happen,\u201d she noted. In 1970, Dane founded Paredon Records, a label that allowed her to release albums alongside music she embraced from across the globe. Her 1973 album I Hate the Capitalist System is brilliantly blunt, an overlooked gem, with Working Class Woman being a trenchant protest song. The album feels ever more relevant now. \u201cCapitalism has made things worse than they were then, sure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s increased economic insecurity and that\u2019s why we find people turning to Trump and conspiracy theories and religion, the stuff that gives them easy answers. As a Marxist, I believe that a period of socialism has to follow. If I\u2019m wrong, well, I won\u2019t be here but our world can\u2019t survive. Capitalism and climate change have created a crisis.\u201d She lived longer than most of her contemporaries, and Dane recalled comedian Lenny Bruce and folk singer Phil Ochs \u2013 both radical artists who died young \u2013 with affection. \u201cLenny was dedicated to outing all the hypocrites and they made him pay for it. Phil was bipolar.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. The UN human rights office (OHCHR) has said that Israel may be causing the \u201cdestruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza\u2019s northernmost governorate through death and displacement\u201d with its latest military campaign there. The Israel Defense Forces had made life in north Gaza \u201cimpossible\u201d for Palestinians, many of whom were already facing starvation, while also ordering their displacement and preventing supplies from entering, OHCHR said in a statement. Israel had \u201ccontinued to relentlessly bomb and attack the area\u201d making it \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d for civilians to flee, the body wrote, adding that it had received reports of civilians being deliberately targeted. It added: \u201cMany Palestinians in the north have also expressed fears that, should they flee, they will never be allowed to return to their homes in north Gaza.\u201d Meanwhile, Doctors Without Borders condemned Israel\u2019s siege on the last remaining hospitals in Gaza, saying: \u201cThis is purely and simply a collective punishment imposed on Palestinians in Gaza, who must choose between being forcibly displaced from the north or killed. We fear that this will not stop.\u201d What have been recent targets of Israeli airstrikes? Several Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured late on Sunday when Israeli airstrikes hit two schools housing displaced people in Jabaliya, the area in northern Gaza that Israel has placed under siege for more than two weeks. What\u2019s the latest with Israel\u2019s invasion of southern Lebanon? Israeli forces have \u201cdeliberately demolished an observation tower and perimeter fence of a UN position in Marwahin\u201d, the UN peacekeeping mission said on Sunday. What\u2019s the situation with Iran and the wider region? The US government is investigating an unauthorised release of classified documents that assess Israel\u2019s plans to attack Iran. Musk pledges $1m each day in apparent bid to galvanize Republican voters Elon Musk said on Saturday that America Pac, the Donald Trump-allied political action committee he founded, will give $1m every day until the presidential election to someone who signs his petition, which appears to be a way to incentivize Republicans in battleground states to register to vote. \u201cWe are going to be awarding $1m randomly to people who have signed the petition,\u201d Musk said at a town hall event in Pennsylvania. Wait, is that legal? Several legal experts said the petition may violate federal election laws that prohibit paying or offering to pay for someone to register to vote. Election updates: Trump goes to McDonald\u2019s while Harris celebrates 60th birthday Donald Trump visited a McDonald\u2019s franchise in Pennsylvania on Sunday, working the drive-thru and manning the fryer. The former president took a moment to boast about his time in office and sarcastically congratulated Kamala Harris on her 60th birthday. Harris celebrated her birthday at two churches in Georgia, continuing her campaign\u2019s \u201csouls to the polls\u201d push to reach Black voters through religious communities. Both campaigns are focused on rallying support from voters in the battleground states, 16 days before a presidential election that is still on a knife-edge. What are the polls saying? The election is basically deadlocked. Harris has tiny polling leads in Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Trump has tiny polling leads in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, but the races remain far too close to predict with any certainty. In other news \u2026 Russian strikes on Kharkiv wounded nine people and cut power to part of the city, local officials and police said. New Mexico state police said on Sunday that at least two people have died as a result of flash floods. Search and rescue missions are under way.

      "body": "<h2>Slegers steadies ship at Arsenal</h2> <p>The issues that plagued Arsenal under Jonas Eidevall will not go away overnight, but two wins from two under interim manager Ren\u00e9e Slegers will do a lot for the confidence of the team. \u201cIt is what we wanted, we knew we had these two games ahead of us and we wanted to win them both and we have to be happy with it,\u201d said Slegers. A 2-0 win at West Ham, a team that beat them in the corresponding fixture last season, will feel cathartic for Arsenal. It took until the 71st minute for them to break the deadlock and the goal came via a penalty. That opened the game up enough for the visiting team to grab a late second. The difficulties Arsenal have had breaking down low blocks remains, though. There are positives \u2013 the introduction of four substitutes around the hour mark made the difference, a sign that Slegers will not sit and wait for something to happen when things are not working. <strong>SW</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/20/west-ham-arsenal-womens-super-league-match-report\">West Ham 0-2 Arsenal</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Parris makes her point to United, and England</h2> <p>There appeared to be no love lost between Nikita Parris and Manchester United as the England forward equalised against her former club for Brighton in Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw and then celebrated passionately, running towards the technical areas to do so. Parris said before the game that she wanted to give the England head coach, Sarina Wiegman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/18/nikita-parris-brighton-sarina-wiegman-england-manchester-united\">a selection headache</a> but it will have been her former manager, Marc Skinner, whose head was throbbing after seeing his team concede a goal in the league for the first time this season. It was Parris\u2019 second goal in three league starts for Brighton. The result ended United\u2019s 100% winning start to the campaign but they remain unbeaten and will have been encouraged by yet another strong performance from the England midfielder Grace Clinton, who attacked the near post to open the scoring from Celin Bizet\u2019s cross before later striking the crossbar. <strong>TG</strong></p> <h2>More Hemp heroics inspire City</h2> <p>Lauren Hemp continued to prove her importance to Manchester City as they came from behind to beat Aston Villa 2-1 on Sunday. Following Gabi Nunes\u2019 first-half opener, the City winger equalised with a composed volley from 12 yards out. She then provided the assist for Jill Roord\u2019s winning strike by skipping past three Villa defenders and playing a short pass. Hemp has now created 20 chances in the WSL this season, more than any other player. \u201cShe was everywhere today, she just gives such energy,\u201d said City\u2019s manager, Gareth Taylor. \u201cWhen she has that mindset of doing everything with and without the ball, she\u2019s such a role model for every player we have and of course the girls managed the game really well.\u201d <strong>EH</strong></p>    <h2>\u2018Ghost goal\u2019 not enough to spook Chelsea</h2> <p>Tottenham\u2019s \u201cghost goal\u201d was not enough to beat Chelsea, despite a strong first-half performance on Sunday. Chelsea, who took the lead through Maika Hamano on 10 minutes, were pegged back almost immediately when Amanda Nild\u00e9n\u2019s cross-shot was judged to have crossed the line by the assistant referee. Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, who caught the ball and seemingly palmed it down on to her goalline, protested in vain, earning a yellow card for her troubles. Yet the replays appeared to support her case. The controversy wasn\u2019t enough to stop the defending champions, however, as they overpowered Spurs in the second half, with Johanna Rytting Kaneryd scoring a brace to seal a victory over their London rivals. Chelsea\u2019s manager Sonia Bompastor said afterwards: \u201cI just feel like if the technology is on and available for the men\u2019s game, why don\u2019t we have the same?\u201d <strong>XA</strong></p> <h2>Beard berates his \u2018lucky\u2019 Liverpool</h2> <p>Liverpool\u2019s manager, Matt Beard, strongly criticised his side\u2019s work rate and a lack of bravery after they were held to a 1-1 draw at home by their newly-promoted visitors Crystal Palace. Katie Stengel\u2019s goal against her former club helped Palace earn their point, adding to the home fans\u2019 frustration, and although Olivia Smith hit the post Liverpool could have few complaints about the scoreline. Palace head coach, Laura Kaminski, was right in suggesting her team \u201ccould have got more\u201d than a point, while a frustrated Beard said: \u201cI feel Palace wanted it more, we were lucky to get a point to be blunt and honest. Palace deserved to take all three. We were pulling out of tackles. I can forgive misplaced passes, I can forgive mistakes but what I can\u2019t forgive is obviously the work rate. You\u2019ve got to have that [work rate] in abundance and we just didn\u2019t have that. We just weren\u2019t brave enough and we were lucky in the end.\u201d The result extended Liverpool\u2019s wait for a first win at their new home, which they are ground-sharing at St Helens. <strong>TG</strong></p> <h2>Toothless Toffees left frustrated</h2> <p>Everton were left to rue a series of missed chances after falling to a narrow 1-0 defeat to Leicester at the King Power Stadium on Sunday. The visitors created several opportunities following Yuka Momiki\u2019s 10th-minute strike but failed to make the most of them. Justine Vanhaevermaet and Toni Payne both came agonisingly close to equalising in the latter stages but missed the target by a matter of inches. Before the match Everton\u2019s manager, Brian S\u00f8rensen, emphasised the importance of converting chances, but he was left downcast at full time. \u201cWe did everything we could except put the ball into the goal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe create, create, create and we can\u2019t put it in so I\u2019m super-disappointed.

VWFS provides finance across Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi, Skoda and Porsche, and made profits of \u00a3276m in 2023 while funding 400,000 vehicles worth more than \u00a310bn in the year.</p> <p>However, the FCA detailed a litany of failures by VWFS after it looked into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/fears-of-crisis-in-uk-car-finance-market-as-owners-seek-payments-help\">treatment of customers in financial difficulty</a>. The action covers the period from 2017 to July 2023, including the Covid pandemic and the subsequent cost of living crisis, when many households were facing severe financial difficulties through no fault of their own.</p> <p>The FCA is also looking into separate complaints that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/30/fleecing-the-man-off-the-street-car-dealers-investigated-over-high-interest-rates\">car dealers overcharged customers</a>.</p> <p>Under UK consumer laws, lenders have a duty to treat customers fairly when they say they are struggling to make repayments. However, the consequences of VW\u2019s actions included \u201cexacerbating stress and anxiety for customers who were already struggling with their mental wellbeing\u201d and taking cars away from people who relied upon them for work.</p> <p>In one example, a parent told the company of a customer\u2019s suicide attempt \u201cowing to stress and financial struggles\u201d on top of a battle over child custody. He said VW\u2019s treatment was making the situation worse, including sending a threatening letter two weeks after a suicide attempt.</p> <p>Agents displayed a \u201clack of empathy\u201d in phone communications, including one who sarcastically reminded the customer of the number of days in a month, and another who put him through to departments that could not help him. The company acknowledged that he was vulnerable only after chasing him for 11 months.</p> <p>Another customer asked for breathing space while going through a divorce and self-isolating during the pandemic while helping to care for a relative with cancer. \u201cVWFS did not engage with that email in any substantive way,\u201d the FCA said.</p> <p>VWFS avoided a higher fine of \u00a37.7m as it co-operated with the investigation. It has also implemented a new debt-collection model.</p> <p>Therese Chambers, a joint executive director at the FCA, said that for many people, \u201ca car is not a \u2018nice to have\u2019 but a necessity for work or for family life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cVolkswagen Finance made tough personal situations worse by failing to consider what those in difficulty might need,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is right it compensates those who suffered. This fine and redress should send clear signals to lenders that they need to properly support those in financial difficulty.\u201d</p> <p>A VWFS spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise our shortcomings in these past cases and have made significant adjustments over recent years to ensure that we are always delivering the right level of service.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the process of concluding our remediation efforts as we continue to provide goodwill payments to affected customers and apologise for any detriment caused.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on 116 123 and the <a href=\"https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/\">domestic abuse helpline</a> is 0808 2000 247.

The vast majority of new cars in the UK are bought using some form of finance, and much of it is offered through \u201ccaptive\u201d companies owned by carmakers. Such companies owned by the likes of Ford, Stellantis and Volkswagen are major UK lenders, and tend to be very profitable. VWFS provides finance across Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi, Skoda and Porsche, and made profits of \u00a3276m in 2023 while funding 400,000 vehicles worth more than \u00a310bn in the year. However, the FCA detailed a litany of failures by VWFS after it looked into the treatment of customers in financial difficulty. The action covers the period from 2017 to July 2023, including the Covid pandemic and the subsequent cost of living crisis, when many households were facing severe financial difficulties through no fault of their own. The FCA is also looking into separate complaints that car dealers overcharged customers. Under UK consumer laws, lenders have a duty to treat customers fairly when they say they are struggling to make repayments. However, the consequences of VW\u2019s actions included \u201cexacerbating stress and anxiety for customers who were already struggling with their mental wellbeing\u201d and taking cars away from people who relied upon them for work. In one example, a parent told the company of a customer\u2019s suicide attempt \u201cowing to stress and financial struggles\u201d on top of a battle over child custody. He said VW\u2019s treatment was making the situation worse, including sending a threatening letter two weeks after a suicide attempt. Agents displayed a \u201clack of empathy\u201d in phone communications, including one who sarcastically reminded the customer of the number of days in a month, and another who put him through to departments that could not help him. The company acknowledged that he was vulnerable only after chasing him for 11 months. Another customer asked for breathing space while going through a divorce and self-isolating during the pandemic while helping to care for a relative with cancer. \u201cVWFS did not engage with that email in any substantive way,\u201d the FCA said. VWFS avoided a higher fine of \u00a37.7m as it co-operated with the investigation. It has also implemented a new debt-collection model. Therese Chambers, a joint executive director at the FCA, said that for many people, \u201ca car is not a \u2018nice to have\u2019 but a necessity for work or for family life\u201d. \u201cVolkswagen Finance made tough personal situations worse by failing to consider what those in difficulty might need,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is right it compensates those who suffered. This fine and redress should send clear signals to lenders that they need to properly support those in financial difficulty.\u201d A VWFS spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise our shortcomings in these past cases and have made significant adjustments over recent years to ensure that we are always delivering the right level of service. \u201cWe are in the process of concluding our remediation efforts as we continue to provide goodwill payments to affected customers and apologise for any detriment caused.\u201d In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is at 988 and the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). Other international helplines can be found via www.befrienders.org",

      "bodyText": "A helicopter crashed Sunday after hitting a radio tower in Houston, killing four people on board, including a child, fire officials said. Houston authorities said the aircraft, an R44 helicopter, went down just before 8pm in Houston\u2019s Second Ward, east of the city\u2019s downtown, after apparently taking off from Ellington Field about 15 miles away. The identities of the victims and their ages have not yet been released. The tower into which the helicopter crashed is near the intersection of Engelke and Ennis streets, the Houston fire department said in a post on the social media platform X. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) notice published four days before the Sunday night\u2019s crash warned that at least some of the lights on the radio tower in question were inoperable, according to an X post from Pat Cavlin, a reporter for the Houston news outlet KHOU. A post by X user Jay Marroquin says it contains a home security camera video that shows the moment the crash occurred. The video shows a tower with a light blinking at the top, though there do not appear to be any other lights visible. The helicopter is flying several feet under that blinking light when it strikes the tower, according to the video. Houston city council member Mario Castillo added in a separate X post that the helicopter that crashed was used for private tours. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it would investigate the helicopter crash. The NTSB process could take up to two years to complete, though a preliminary report with any available facts about the crash is expected within a few weeks. Local media outlets reported a large amount of emergency personnel responded to the scene. Police and fire officials urged residents near the crash site to call 911 if they find anything on their property that could help investigators. The Associated Press contributed reporting",

Several clubs in Italy and Spain made enquiries but Genoa acted decisively to sign him in the summer of 2023. Retegui bagged seven goals in his first Serie A season.</p> \n<p>Still, there was little consensus regarding his talent.

Retegui failed to score in four appearances before Italy limply exited Euro 2024 in the last 16.</p> \n<p>So did Gianluca Scamacca, with whom he alternated at centre-forward. A player whose subsequent injury opened up the next big opportunity of Retegui\u2019s career.</p> \n<p>On 4 August, Scamacca ruptured the cruciate ligament in his left knee during a friendly for Atalanta against Parma. Four days later, Retegui signed for the Bergamese club. An intermediary came to get him in the middle of training for Genoa: \u201cThey said: get your things, we need to go to Milan for a medical.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another snap decision. Another good one. Not everyone was convinced Retegui would be a natural fit at Atalanta, who paid a reported \u20ac22m plus bonuses. Scamacca is a target man, whose associative back-to-goal play was essential to a team that finished fourth in Serie A and won the Europa League last season. Retegui is a completely different mould of centre-forward: one who lives to get into the penalty box.</p> \n<p>Atalanta would need to reshape their entire attacking approach to get the most from his talents. For another team that might seem like a tough ask so close to the start of a new season. Perhaps not for one coached by Gian Piero Gasperini.</p> \n<p>The manager\u2019s extraordinary capacity for retooling has long since ceased to be a local secret. Atalanta have gone through at least three distinct eras in the eight years since Gasperini took charge, from a top-four team built around Papu G\u00f3mez and Franck Kessi\u00e9, to Champions League quarter-finalists powered by Duv\u00e1n Zapata, Luis Muriel and Josip Ilicic, and now the club\u2019s first-ever European trophy, earned by new heroes including Scamacca, Teun Koopmeiners and Ademola Lookman.</p> \n<p>Still, this summer presented him with unwelcome challenges even before Scamacca went down. Centre-back Giorgio Scalvini suffered his own cruciate ligament injury at the end of last season, Koopmeiners was sold to Juventus, and Lookman missed the start of the campaign amid reports that he, too, was lobbying for a transfer.</p> \n<p>Integrating Retegui could have been one more headache. Instead, the striker made it look easy. After a cameo off the bench in Atalanta\u2019s Super Cup defeat to Real Madrid, Retegui started Atalanta\u2019s Serie A opener against Lecce and scored twice in a 4-0 win. He struck again in the next game, away to Torino.</p> \n<p>Not everything was perfect. Atalanta lost that second match before being trounced 4-0 by Inter. Yet Retegui bagged another goal immediately afterwards in a 3-2 win over Fiorentina and, though he did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/19/atalanta-arsenal-champions-league-match-report\">miss a penalty</a> in his Champions League debut against Arsenal, the way fans sang his name afterwards spoke volumes.</p> \n<p>Their appreciation has only deepened since. Retegui struck again as Atalanta won 2-0 away to Venezia on Sunday, his eighth goal in eight games \u2013 enough to make him Serie A\u2019s top scorer.</p> \n<p>This one was a blend of opportunism and finesse. Retegui punished Antonio Candela\u2019s lack of urgency to claim a bouncing ball outside the box, before lifting a close-range chip over a goalkeeper who had extended himself to full height.</p> \n<p>Among the most impressive aspects of Retegui\u2019s fast start has been the variety of ways in which he has connected ball with net. He has already scored three headers, more than Scamacca managed in the entire last campaign. The other five goals include strikes off both his left boot and his right. There have even been a pair of assists.</p> \n<p>\u201cRetegui is showing great value,\u201d said Gasperini at full time on Sunday. \u201cHe still has margins for growth but technically he is doing really well \u2026 he arrived here very determined and the few things we\u2019ve asked him to do he has put into practice on the pitch right away.\u201d</p> \n<p>How much of the credit is due to the manager? Gasperini has adapted his tactics, developing a 3-4-2-1 in which Lookman and Charles De Ketelaere share the wide spaces with Atalanta\u2019s wing-backs, allowing Retegui to focus his abundant energies on getting into the box. Yet the striker has also seized his opportunity more confidently than many might have predicted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"029b1009-94f9-4ea9-abca-0aa9bed55cf7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Genoa 2-2 Bologna, Como 1-1 Parma, Milan 1-0 Udinese, Juventus 1-0 Lazio, Empoli 0-1 Napoli, Venezia 0-2 Atalanta, Lecce 0-6 Fiorentina, Cagliari 3-2 Torino, Roma 0-1 Inter</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Monday:</b> Verona v Monza</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>We had seen already last season how he could trouble defenders, bullish physicality and direct running combined with excellent instincts close to goal.

His form has carried over to the national team, for whom he scored against both Belgium and Israel in Nations League games this month.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very serious lad,\u201d said the Italy manager Luciano Spalletti last week. \u201cInside the box, he is lethal.

When Roberto Mancini phoned to ask if he would consider representing the Italian national team last March, the striker \u201cdidn\u2019t have to think about it. I just said yes right away\u201d. Born and raised in Argentina, he had never lived in Italy nor did he speak the language, yet within days he marked his international debut with a goal against England in Naples. A choice that shifted his whole life\u2019s trajectory. Twenty-three years old and playing for Tigre on loan from Boca Juniors, Retegui was hardly at the forefront of most European scouts\u2019 minds.

Playing for the Azzurri \u2013 and scoring, as he also did in his second international game, against Malta, days later \u2013 opened up a whole new market. Several clubs in Italy and Spain made enquiries but Genoa acted decisively to sign him in the summer of 2023. Retegui bagged seven goals in his first Serie A season. Still, there was little consensus regarding his talent. Retegui had found the net once for every 318 minutes that he played, neither a spectacular return nor a disgraceful one for a player adjusting to life on a new continent, with a club that had only just bounced back from the second tier. He continued to feature regularly for Italy, but was that more a reflection of his performances or the country\u2019s lack of options? Mancini lamented a shortage of attacking talent before he quit and took the Saudi Arabia job last August. Retegui failed to score in four appearances before Italy limply exited Euro 2024 in the last 16. So did Gianluca Scamacca, with whom he alternated at centre-forward. A player whose subsequent injury opened up the next big opportunity of Retegui\u2019s career. On 4 August, Scamacca ruptured the cruciate ligament in his left knee during a friendly for Atalanta against Parma. Four days later, Retegui signed for the Bergamese club. An intermediary came to get him in the middle of training for Genoa: \u201cThey said: get your things, we need to go to Milan for a medical.\u201d Another snap decision. Another good one. Not everyone was convinced Retegui would be a natural fit at Atalanta, who paid a reported \u20ac22m plus bonuses. Scamacca is a target man, whose associative back-to-goal play was essential to a team that finished fourth in Serie A and won the Europa League last season. Retegui is a completely different mould of centre-forward: one who lives to get into the penalty box. Atalanta would need to reshape their entire attacking approach to get the most from his talents. For another team that might seem like a tough ask so close to the start of a new season. Perhaps not for one coached by Gian Piero Gasperini. The manager\u2019s extraordinary capacity for retooling has long since ceased to be a local secret. Atalanta have gone through at least three distinct eras in the eight years since Gasperini took charge, from a top-four team built around Papu G\u00f3mez and Franck Kessi\u00e9, to Champions League quarter-finalists powered by Duv\u00e1n Zapata, Luis Muriel and Josip Ilicic, and now the club\u2019s first-ever European trophy, earned by new heroes including Scamacca, Teun Koopmeiners and Ademola Lookman.

      "bodyText": "Transport for London (TfL) could be forced to pay back millions of pounds in low emission zone fines issued to Dutch lorry drivers after agreeing they had been issued unlawfully. The body said it had agreed to settle a claim regarding the Ulez fines after a company representing dozens of Dutch haulage companies launched a legal challenge into the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) and low emission zone (Lez) fines earlier this year. The settlement comes as TfL is under increased scrutiny over its Ulez charging policy and several European governments have accused it of wrongly fining hundreds of thousands of EU citizens after illegally obtaining their details. The company, Transport in Nood BV (TNBV), launched a judicial review against TfL in the high court this year after claiming that as much as \u20ac7.5m (\u00a36.25m) in Ulez and Lez fines could have been wrongly issued to the Dutch companies it represents. Antonio Oliveira, the owner of TNBV, said at the time that the fines would bankrupt some of the companies, with one transporter of flowers racking up nearly 400 fines, totalling \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3330,000). The Ulez, which was doubled in size in August last year to cover all 32 London boroughs, requires vehicles that do not comply with emissions standards to pay a \u00a312.50 daily charge, or else face a fine of up to \u00a3180 for non-payment. The Lez also applies across London and charges highly polluting heavy goods vehicles for travelling in the city, hitting companies that fail to pay with fines of up to \u00a33,000. TNBV launched the judicial review on the grounds that the fines were unlawfully denominated in euros, which goes against UK legislation indicating that all fines should be given in pounds. It claimed that an excessively high exchange rate was used to calculate the levies, including drivers being charged \u20ac3,600 (\u00a33,200) for Lez fines, when the maximum penalty should be \u00a33,000. It also found that a 5% administrative fee was being added to each fine by TfL\u2019s contractor Euro Parking Collection (EPC). TNBV said TfL had conceded that these fines should have been sent in pounds and no charges should have been added. A TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWe have agreed to settle a claim, which relates solely to a number of penalty charges issued to haulage companies based in the Netherlands. This agreement is subject to approval by the court.\u201d Despite the decision to settle, the two organisations are still in dispute over the amount that should be refunded, with TfL looking to only refund the additional 5% fee on each fine, rather than the full fines. The level of refunds will be decided at the next high court hearing, scheduled for 5 November. The settlement comes as TfL and EPC are under increased pressure over how they administer fines to individuals and businesses based on the continent. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that TfL has been accused by five EU countries of illegally obtaining the names and addresses of their citizens in order to issue more than 320,000 penalties. Since Brexit, the UK has been banned from automatic access to personal details of EU residents, but transport authorities in Belgium, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands allege that TfL obtained these details illegally through EPC. These claims came after some EU residents were hit with bills of up to \u00a311,000 after being caught in the London clean air zones. TfL said at the time that despite an absence of individual data-sharing agreements with EU countries, \u201clocal laws\u201d allowed authorities to share vehicle owner information with the UK for the enforcement of traffic regulations. Commenting on the Dutch settlement, Oliveira said: \u201cWe had long suspected that something was not right \u2026 EPC has been adding an illegal surcharge of at least 5% to every fine they have ever issued. \u201cThis discovery highlights the importance of collectively challenging such practices as a group.

Now not only with weapons and shells but also with personnel.\u201d</p> <p>The centre claimed the footage had been shot by a Russian soldier in recent days. It did not say how it had obtained the clip, and the location is unknown.</p> <p>Asked about the North Korean troops during a conference call with reporters on Monday, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: \u201cWe are seeing a lot of contradictory information. South Koreans say one thing, then the Pentagon says it has no confirmation of such statements. There is a lot of contradictory information. It must be treated as such.\u201d</p> <p>Putin and Kim have not disclosed details of their deal, agreed during the Russian president\u2019s visit to Pyongyang in June. The countries have also denied that North Korea has provided Russia with ammunition and missiles.</p> <p>Those denials have been challenged by Ukrainian, South Korean and US officials. On Friday, South Korean intelligence said North Korea had provided Russia with more than 13,000 containers of artillery shells, missiles, anti-tank rockets and other lethal weapons since August.</p> <p>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said North Korean involvement in the war would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the threat level and instability in the region.</p> <p>Speaking during his nightly video address on Sunday, Zelenskyy said satellite and video evidence of North Korean troops proved that another country had effectively entered the war and demanded a robust response from Kyiv\u2019s allies.</p> <p>\u201cI am grateful to those leaders and representatives of states who do not close their eyes and speak frankly about this cooperation for the sake of a larger war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect a normal, honest, strong reaction from our partners on this.\u201d</p> <p>North Korea has not commented on reports it is sending troops to fight alongside Russia.</p>",

      "bodyText": "South Korea has summoned the Russian ambassador to Seoul to protest \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d about the reported dispatch of thousands of North Korean troops to help Russia in its war against Ukraine. The first vice-foreign minister, Kim Hong-kyun, told the Russian envoy, Georgy Zinoviev, that the participation of North Korean troops in the war violated UN resolutions and demanded their immediate withdrawal, South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday. \u201cWe condemn North Korea\u2019s illegal military cooperation, including its dispatch of troops to Russia, in the strongest terms,\u201d Kim said, adding that the deployment posed a serious threat to the security of South Korea and other countries. \u201cWe will respond jointly with the international community by mobilising all available means against acts that threaten our core security interests.\u201d The decision to call in Zinoviev reflects mounting anger in South Korea, Ukraine and the US over the apparent deployment of North Korean troops as part of a secret military deal struck this year by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. South Korea\u2019s national intelligence service said last week that North Korea had sent an initial contingent of 1,500 special forces personnel to the Russian far east for training at local military bases, adding that they were expected to go on active service in the war in Ukraine. On Friday, the spy agency had said North Korea planned to send about 12,000 special forces to support Russia, possibly to make up for substantial losses of Russian troops and a lack of replacements. It also released satellite images it said showed the first deployment of elite North Korean soldiers being moved by Russian military vessels to Vladivostok between 8 and 13 October. \u201cNorth Korea transported its special forces to Russia via a Russian navy transport ship, confirming the start of North Korea\u2019s military participation,\u201d it said. The White House could not confirm reports that North Korean troops were fighting for Russia, but a national security council spokesperson said that if true it would \u201cmark a dangerous development in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine\u201d. Ukrainian officials on Monday released a video purporting to show dozens of North Korean recruits lining up to collect Russian military fatigues. The video, published by the Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security \u2013 part of the Ukrainian culture and information ministry \u2013 appears to show the soldiers waiting to pick up bags, clothes and other items from Russian service personnel. \u201cWe received this video from our own sources,\u201d Ihor Solovey, the head of the centre, told Associated Press, adding that he was unable to provide additional verification due to security concerns. \u201cThe video clearly shows North Korean citizens being given Russian uniforms under the direction of the Russian military,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Ukraine, this video is important because it is the first video evidence that shows North Korea participating in the war on the side of Russia. Now not only with weapons and shells but also with personnel.\u201d The centre claimed the footage had been shot by a Russian soldier in recent days. It did not say how it had obtained the clip, and the location is unknown. Asked about the North Korean troops during a conference call with reporters on Monday, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: \u201cWe are seeing a lot of contradictory information. South Koreans say one thing, then the Pentagon says it has no confirmation of such statements. There is a lot of contradictory information. It must be treated as such.\u201d Putin and Kim have not disclosed details of their deal, agreed during the Russian president\u2019s visit to Pyongyang in June. The countries have also denied that North Korea has provided Russia with ammunition and missiles. Those denials have been challenged by Ukrainian, South Korean and US officials. On Friday, South Korean intelligence said North Korea had provided Russia with more than 13,000 containers of artillery shells, missiles, anti-tank rockets and other lethal weapons since August. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said North Korean involvement in the war would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the threat level and instability in the region. Speaking during his nightly video address on Sunday, Zelenskyy said satellite and video evidence of North Korean troops proved that another country had effectively entered the war and demanded a robust response from Kyiv\u2019s allies. \u201cI am grateful to those leaders and representatives of states who do not close their eyes and speak frankly about this cooperation for the sake of a larger war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect a normal, honest, strong reaction from our partners on this.\u201d North Korea has not commented on reports it is sending troops to fight alongside Russia.",

And in two groups \u2013 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander and Native American or Alaska Native \u2013 working-age people (ages 25 to 64) had the greatest increase in mortality of any age group. It\u2019s \u201creally devastating, because these are individuals who could be contributing to our society and, more importantly, contributing to their families\u201d, said Utibe Essien, an assistant professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, a primary care physician and one of the co-authors of the study. \u201cThe disparities happen in this working-age population where the implications are so much longer-lasting \u2013 that, to me, was the shocking thing,\u201d said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study.

Working-age Americans saw a 20% increase in mortality rates during the pandemic, while older Americans\u2019 mortality rate increased by 13%. But among younger populations, the effects were starkly unequal.

      "body": "<p>Build it and they will come. That had been the message coming out of Bayern Munich\u2019s corridors of power over the international break, from Vincent Kompany, Max Eberl and the higher-ups. If there had been a fortnight\u2019s worth of heel-kicking it was just that; not stewing, not sulking, but a belief that Bayern were ready to unload on an opponent, with the excellence and exhilaration of their play so far this season bound to reach critical mass.</p> \n<p>Even for a club constantly walled in by hyperbole and overreaction, the description of the team\u2019s pre-international break run of three games without a win as Kompany\u2019s first \u201cmini-crisis\u201d had felt faintly ludicrous. For starters, they were still unbeaten in the Bundesliga and top of the table. The mood suggested a determination to correct course, rather than recrimination and fury. \u201cFor me it isn\u2019t a matter of belief,\u201d Kompany told Bild after Saturday\u2019s 4-0 win over Stuttgart. \u201cIt is about what the analysis showed. That we were dominant, that we had many, many, many more chances than the opponents.\u201d Their winless run was hardly against nobodies either, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/28/bayern-munich-bayer-leverkusen-bundesliga-match-report\">against champions Leverkusen</a>, then Aston Villa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/02/aston-villa-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">on a Champions League night for the ages</a> and lastly in-form Eintracht Frankfurt.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/european-roundup-mainz-fans-fury-jurgen-klopp-red-bull-bundesliga\">\u2018Have you forgotten everything?\u2019 Mainz fans\u2019 fury at Klopp\u2019s Red Bull move</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bayern should have won all three but didn\u2019t. If outside chatter suggested a team that were too open and sporadically vulnerable, the mood inside the club was markedly different. There was no internal call to trust the process because there was no need to. \u201cObjectively,\u201d Kompany insisted, \u201cit would be so stupid to change everything.\u201d</p> \n<p>Those words could have easily applied to Harry Kane as well. If Bayern cut an unusually relaxed posture as a club right now \u2013 and there is no better way of summing up Kompany\u2019s influence \u2013 the discourse around the England captain has been a little different. He didn\u2019t score during the winless run, a topic of constant media focus in Germany, and Bayern would have undoubtedly preferred him to have given international duty a miss for some much-needed recovery. Yet Kane has been doing what he always has, playing himself into form when others say a break is required. His strike from outside the box just before the hour against Stuttgart was his first goal in 393 minutes, and the avalanche that followed was inevitable. His 23-minute hat-trick sealed the deal long before Kingsley Coman garnished the dish with his first Bundesliga goal in two days under a year.</p> \n<p>Stuttgart were never an adversary to be cowed by the challenge. Quite apart from the extent of Sebastian Hoeness\u2019s familiarity with the subject, they are just not that sort of team. Hoeness turned their fortunes around last season not by defensive resolve and opportunism, but by boldness and dominance. He knew exactly what could happen in Saturday evening\u2019s <em>Top-Spiel</em>, and wouldn\u2019t let it submerge their season. Even in last season\u2019s dreamworld, Stuttgart had been here before. They were treated to one of Bayern\u2019s better performances of 2023-24, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/17/european-roundup-harry-kane-doubles-up-as-bayern-munich-keep-up-chase\">beaten 3-0 at the Allianz Arena</a> last December, but the severity of the scoreline is the only thing that those two corresponding matches 10 months apart really share in common.</p> \n<p>After a week in which Germany\u2019s sporting media <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/16/astounding-intense-schadenfreude-in-germany-over-tuchel-and-england\">has tittered into its sleeve</a> about England appointing one of their countrymen in Thomas Tuchel to chase the 2026 World Cup (and in which English football culture has largely aimed not to analyse too closely what went awry for Tuchel during his chaotic spell in Bavaria), Bayern\u2019s current incarnation typed in bold and underlined exactly how different they are in the early months of Kompany\u2019s reign. In that December 2023 win, a brace from Kane led Tuchel\u2019s Bayern out of the traps, just as happened here. But the pragmatic Tuchel had let Stuttgart be themselves. The visitors had 63% of possession in that game, with Bayern ruthlessly picking them off with their quality and verve.</p> \n<p>Kompany\u2019s team? They would never let Stuttgart play on their own terms. The only surprise is that it took such a long period for Bayern to make the breakthrough, perhaps with a touch of the luck that had eluded them for most of the game\u2019s first hour. Kane said afterwards that \u201cnine times out of 10, the goalkeeper probably saves\u201d his opener, with Alexander N\u00fcbel getting a hand on the long-range effort but not managing to keep it out.</p> \n<p>With N\u00fcbel still contracted to Bayern beyond his loan at Stuttgart and a possible successor to Manuel Neuer, some in Germany have wondered if Kane was throwing a little shade in support of one of his senior colleagues. It seems unlikely. We cannot judge Kane on traditional Bayern terms of engagement, just as we cannot with Kompany. This is a coach who will leave out Jo\u00e3o Palhinha if he wants, despite Bayern taking three transfer windows to snare him as a priority target (though having come on for the injured Aleksandar Pavlovic early on, and the youth product likely out for several weeks with a collarbone injury, more opportunity is on the way). If Bayern are to return to greatness, it will be led by men who have their own way of doing things.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"55ebc281-7883-4280-a051-552055f89ec0\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dortmund 2-1 St Pauli, Hoffenheim 3-1 Bochum, Freiburg 3-1 Augsburg, Leverkusen 2-1 Frankfurt, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 3-2 Heidenheim, Mainz 0-2 Leipzig, Bayern Munich 4-0 Stuttgart, Holstein Kiel 0-2 Union Berlin, Wolfsburg 2-4 Werder Bremen</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 RB Leipzig also remain unbeaten, and level on points with Bayern, after a 2-0 win at Mainz in which Xavi Simons scored a sublime opener and produced his best performance of the season. It is remarkable that Marco Rose\u2019s team have thrived thus far without their key man really looking himself, though the sporting director, Rouven Schr\u00f6der, emphasised after the game that \u201cthe quality of the squad is extremely high and we have many potential starters,\u201d underlining their confidence.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Even if they share different outlooks, how Borussia Dortmund would like some of that confidence right now. They squeezed past St Pauli on Friday thanks to a late Serhou Guirassy header (and how they rely on the Guinea striker already), and again Nuri Sahin complained about his team\u2019s defending, even though it took Eric Smith\u2019s wonder strike to breach them. \u201cThe way we defend really annoys me,\u201d he told Dazn. \u201cWe\u2019ve already conceded [poor] goals against Celtic and Union. It\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 It was an intense weekend for Leverkusen\u2019s Victor Boniface. He began it by missing a penalty against Frankfurt, then scored the second-half winner as Leverkusen came back from a goal down. Boniface was then involved in a car accident which left the Mercedes he was travelling in written off. Though he fortunately escaped serious injury, there is doubt over whether he will play Wednesday\u2019s Champions League game at Brest.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Over at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Gerardo Seoane is just about keeping the wolf from the door, with Tim Kleindienst coming through for him by scoring twice as the architect of a 3-2 win over his old club Heidenheim (Kleindienst didn\u2019t celebrate). It has been an incredible few weeks for the striker, having made his Germany debut 10 days ago at the age of 29. Seoane needs him more than ever, having been booed on to the touchline at the start by some fans, with the sporting director Roland Virkus warning that \u201cwe can\u2019t sit back because we played a good game\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/625\"> \n <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table

Bayern should have won all three but didn\u2019t. If outside chatter suggested a team that were too open and sporadically vulnerable, the mood inside the club was markedly different. There was no internal call to trust the process because there was no need to. \u201cObjectively,\u201d Kompany insisted, \u201cit would be so stupid to change everything.\u201d Those words could have easily applied to Harry Kane as well. If Bayern cut an unusually relaxed posture as a club right now \u2013 and there is no better way of summing up Kompany\u2019s influence \u2013 the discourse around the England captain has been a little different. He didn\u2019t score during the winless run, a topic of constant media focus in Germany, and Bayern would have undoubtedly preferred him to have given international duty a miss for some much-needed recovery. Yet Kane has been doing what he always has, playing himself into form when others say a break is required. His strike from outside the box just before the hour against Stuttgart was his first goal in 393 minutes, and the avalanche that followed was inevitable. His 23-minute hat-trick sealed the deal long before Kingsley Coman garnished the dish with his first Bundesliga goal in two days under a year. Stuttgart were never an adversary to be cowed by the challenge. Quite apart from the extent of Sebastian Hoeness\u2019s familiarity with the subject, they are just not that sort of team. Hoeness turned their fortunes around last season not by defensive resolve and opportunism, but by boldness and dominance. He knew exactly what could happen in Saturday evening\u2019s Top-Spiel, and wouldn\u2019t let it submerge their season. Even in last season\u2019s dreamworld, Stuttgart had been here before. They were treated to one of Bayern\u2019s better performances of 2023-24, beaten 3-0 at the Allianz Arena last December, but the severity of the scoreline is the only thing that those two corresponding matches 10 months apart really share in common. After a week in which Germany\u2019s sporting media has tittered into its sleeve about England appointing one of their countrymen in Thomas Tuchel to chase the 2026 World Cup (and in which English football culture has largely aimed not to analyse too closely what went awry for Tuchel during his chaotic spell in Bavaria), Bayern\u2019s current incarnation typed in bold and underlined exactly how different they are in the early months of Kompany\u2019s reign. In that December 2023 win, a brace from Kane led Tuchel\u2019s Bayern out of the traps, just as happened here. But the pragmatic Tuchel had let Stuttgart be themselves. The visitors had 63% of possession in that game, with Bayern ruthlessly picking them off with their quality and verve. Kompany\u2019s team? They would never let Stuttgart play on their own terms. The only surprise is that it took such a long period for Bayern to make the breakthrough, perhaps with a touch of the luck that had eluded them for most of the game\u2019s first hour. Kane said afterwards that \u201cnine times out of 10, the goalkeeper probably saves\u201d his opener, with Alexander N\u00fcbel getting a hand on the long-range effort but not managing to keep it out. With N\u00fcbel still contracted to Bayern beyond his loan at Stuttgart and a possible successor to Manuel Neuer, some in Germany have wondered if Kane was throwing a little shade in support of one of his senior colleagues. It seems unlikely. We cannot judge Kane on traditional Bayern terms of engagement, just as we cannot with Kompany. This is a coach who will leave out Jo\u00e3o Palhinha if he wants, despite Bayern taking three transfer windows to snare him as a priority target (though having come on for the injured Aleksandar Pavlovic early on, and the youth product likely out for several weeks with a collarbone injury, more opportunity is on the way). If Bayern are to return to greatness, it will be led by men who have their own way of doing things. Talking points \u2022 RB Leipzig also remain unbeaten, and level on points with Bayern, after a 2-0 win at Mainz in which Xavi Simons scored a sublime opener and produced his best performance of the season. It is remarkable that Marco Rose\u2019s team have thrived thus far without their key man really looking himself, though the sporting director, Rouven Schr\u00f6der, emphasised after the game that \u201cthe quality of the squad is extremely high and we have many potential starters,\u201d underlining their confidence. \u2022 Even if they share different outlooks, how Borussia Dortmund would like some of that confidence right now. They squeezed past St Pauli on Friday thanks to a late Serhou Guirassy header (and how they rely on the Guinea striker already), and again Nuri Sahin complained about his team\u2019s defending, even though it took Eric Smith\u2019s wonder strike to breach them. \u201cThe way we defend really annoys me,\u201d he told Dazn. \u201cWe\u2019ve already conceded [poor] goals against Celtic and Union. It\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d \u2022 It was an intense weekend for Leverkusen\u2019s Victor Boniface. He began it by missing a penalty against Frankfurt, then scored the second-half winner as Leverkusen came back from a goal down. Boniface was then involved in a car accident which left the Mercedes he was travelling in written off. Though he fortunately escaped serious injury, there is doubt over whether he will play Wednesday\u2019s Champions League game at Brest. \u2022 Over at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Gerardo Seoane is just about keeping the wolf from the door, with Tim Kleindienst coming through for him by scoring twice as the architect of a 3-2 win over his old club Heidenheim (Kleindienst didn\u2019t celebrate). It has been an incredible few weeks for the striker, having made his Germany debut 10 days ago at the age of 29. Seoane needs him more than ever, having been booed on to the touchline at the start by some fans, with the sporting director Roland Virkus warning that \u201cwe can\u2019t sit back because we played a good game\u201d.",

But Adkins\u2019 first pregnancy had gone so smoothly, she didn\u2019t even use an epidural when she gave birth. Her next pregnancy, she expected, would be similar.</p> \n<p>But in April 2023, 12 weeks into her second pregnancy, an ultrasound scan shattered that hope.</p> \n<p>The ultrasound indicated a litany of issues with the fetus, whom Adkins and her husband had taken to calling \u201cSpooky\u201d, since Adkins\u2019 due date was Halloween. Spooky, Adkins learned, showed multiple signs of a chromosomal disorder as well as dangerously severe swelling. Together, these conditions usually lead to a miscarriage or death shortly after delivery, Adkins\u2019 doctors told her. And if the pregnancy continued, Adkins herself was at risk of developing life-threatening pre-eclampsia and swelling.</p> \n<p>As the mother of a toddler son, Adkins was not willing to take that chance.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that you understand, until you are in that situation, how scary and how awful that actually is,\u201d Adkins said during a recent interview at a coffee shop outside Boise.</p> \n<p>Under Idaho law, abortions are permitted in medical emergencies. But although Adkins\u2019 health was in jeopardy, her doctors didn\u2019t believe her case was enough of an emergency to legally end the pregnancy. They were too afraid of Idaho\u2019s ban to even refer<strong> </strong>her to an out-of-state abortion clinic.</p> \n<p>So<strong> </strong>Adkins and her husband frantically called clinics in Washington, Oregon and Utah, trying to find somewhere within driving distance that was not booked up for weeks with other patients fleeing the<strong> </strong>abortion bans now blanketing the US. The couple also scrambled for financial support to pay for the procedure and travel. If they had to shoulder all those costs on their own, the family would be at risk of being unable to afford their mortgage.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about all these logistics when all you want to think about is grieving the loss of a baby that you really wanted,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cNone of us feel good about making that decision. But it is a loving choice that we should be able to make for our family.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adkins is far from the only woman to come forward to say she was denied a medically necessary abortion in the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and paved the way for more than a dozen states to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state\">ban almost all abortions</a>. Although these bans technically permit the procedure in emergencies, their exceptions are worded so vaguely that doctors across the country say it\u2019s not clear when they can legally intervene. Fearful of the criminal consequences of violating bans, doctors<strong> </strong>are forced to wait and watch as patients get sicker and sicker \u2013 and then attempt to pull them back from the brink of death.</p> \n<p>As the home of what may be the strictest abortion ban in the country, Idaho is a cautionary tale about what can happen when the right to abortion disappears: droves of doctors have fled the state, which already had rising rates of maternal and infant mortality, and the state has become a laboratory for testing other laws meant to limit<strong> </strong>support for<strong> </strong>abortion patients. </p> \n<p>\u201cThose opposed to abortion access and reproductive healthcare access have had a playbook for a really long time, and Idaho is a textbook example of their playbook,\u201d said Jessica Waters, an American University professor who studies reproductive rights. \u201cEverything that\u2019s happening in Idaho is a playbook, I think, for what could happen in the rest of the country.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>What a Trump administration could mean for abortion nationally</strong></h2> \n<p>If Donald Trump wins the presidency in November, even<strong> </strong>abortion access for<strong> </strong>women in blue states may be under threat. Although Trump \u2013 who appointed three of the justices who overturned Roe \u2013 recently claimed that he would veto a national ban, he has repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue. And a Trump administration would not need Congress to wreak havoc on abortion access nationwide or to in effect ban the procedure.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/project-2025-abortion\">Project 2025</a>, the controversial policy playbook for a future conservative administration, proposes using the Comstock Act, an 1873 anti-vice law that outlaws the mailing of abortion-related materials, to ban people from shipping abortion pills. These pills currently account for about two-thirds of US abortions; they can also be used to safely self-induce an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.</p> \n<p>Some anti-abortion activists believe the Comstock Act can do even more: if enacted to its fullest extent, it could not only ban pills but the very equipment that clinics need to do their jobs.</p> \n<p>Without ever involving Congress, Trump could use the Comstock Act to implement a nationwide de facto abortion ban. And if he doesn\u2019t, the courts could: anti-abortion activists have begun to seed lawsuits throughout the country that cite Comstock, while the supreme court\u2019s far-right justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/26/us-supreme-court-abortion-pill-case-mifepristone\">both brought up the 151-year-old law</a> in recent arguments.</p> \n<p>Trump could also<strong> </strong>step back from enforcing a federal law that protects access to emergency abortions. Over the last year, Idaho has been at the center of the debate over this law, a debate that recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/apr/24/us-supreme-court-abortion-rights-emtala\">made its way to the US</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/apr/24/us-supreme-court-abortion-rights-emtala\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/apr/24/us-supreme-court-abortion-rights-emtala\">supreme court</a>.</p> \n<p>The law \u2013 the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or Emtala \u2013 requires hospitals to stabilize patients who show up at their doors in the midst of a medical emergency or transport them to a hospital that can do so. But Idaho\u2019s abortion ban only permits abortions in medical emergencies when a patient\u2019s life is at stake \u2013 an exception, the Biden administration argued to the supreme court, that is so narrow it violates Emtala. Idaho pushed back, arguing in part that the federal government can\u2019t compel doctors to offer care that is illegal under state law.</p> \n<p>The supreme court essentially punted on whether Emtala extends to emergency abortions. The justices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/27/supreme-court-allows-emergency-abortions-idaho\">restored a lower court order</a> that lets Idaho doctors perform a broader range of emergency abortions, but left the door open to reconsider Emtala in the future.</p> \n<p>Without a Democrat in the White House to fight it, Idaho\u2019s interpretation of Emtala could end up becoming a widespread standard.</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018These are not normal conversations\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Many doctors have left Idaho rather than work under its ban. In the 15 months after Idaho\u2019s ban took effect, 22% of Idaho obstetricians stopped working in the state, according to a report by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative and the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare. Three <a href=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/04/22/idaho-doctor-who-worked-at-closed-maternity-ward-says-abortion-ban-harmed-recruiting/#:~:text=Caldwell's%20West%20Valley%20Medical%20Center,abortion%20ban%20in%20August%202022.\">labor and delivery wards have closed</a>. More than half of the state\u2019s nine maternal fetal medicine specialists have left or stopped working in the state full-time.</p> \n<p>Dr Kylie Cooper is one of them.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was a very real concern of mine that a situation would come up that somebody requires abortion care that I cannot provide, or that I am providing and at risk of being charged with a felony and going to prison,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI lost a lot of sleep over it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cooper and her husband tried to game out the logistics of Cooper being arrested. Would she go to jail immediately? Could she get bail? What would that mean for their small children? Eventually, Cooper thought: \u201cWhat are we even doing?</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are not normal conversations. These are not conversations that I ever anticipated having in my medical career, in my life,\u201d she continued. \u201cThinking about myself and my family and my future patients, we made the really difficult decision to leave the state because of the bans.\u201d</p> \n<p>She now works in Minnesota.</p> \n<p>In interviews by the Guardian<strong> </strong>with nearly a dozen Idaho-based OB-GYNs and family medicine physicians \u2013 two specialties that tend to handle pregnancy \u2013 over the last year, every one said that they had considered leaving the state, if not the country. Experts are still trying to calculate the impact of abortion bans on infant and maternal mortality, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/24/texas-abortion-ban-infant-deaths\">one study linked a Texas abortion ban</a> to a 13% increase in the number of infants who died in their first year of life.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/us-elections-2024/stakes-carousel\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At least two women, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death\">Amber Nicole Thurman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/candi-miller-abortion-ban-death-georgia\">Candi Miller</a>, died after being unable to access legal abortions in their home state of Georgia, which bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, according to recent reporting by ProPublica. Experts deemed both of their deaths \u201cpreventable\u201d.</p> \n<p>Idaho has also sought to limit access to abortion in other ways. In 2023, the state created the crime of \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d when it passed a law banning people from taking minors across state lines for legal abortions if their parents had not consented. That same year, Idaho\u2019s Republican attorney general, Ra\u00fal Labrador, issued a legal opinion claiming that Idaho law blocked medical professionals from even referring people for legal out-of-state abortions.</p> \n<p>Separately, Idaho professors and teachers\u2019 unions sued over a law that makes it a crime to use public funds to \u201cpromote\u201d or \u201ccounsel in favor of abortion\u201d. .</p> \n<p>Courts have since blocked the abortion trafficking law and the attorney general\u2019s legal opinion from taking effect, while dismissing the teachers\u2019 lawsuit after Labrador said academic speech about abortion was not prohibited under Idaho law. However, <a href=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/08/26/helping-a-minor-travel-for-an-abortion-some-states-have-made-it-a-crime/#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20Idaho%20became%20the%20first%20state%20to%20outlaw%20%E2%80%9Cabortion,abortion%20medication%20without%20parental%20permission.\">four other states</a> have since introduced abortion trafficking legislation. One of those states, Tennessee, has passed it.</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s scary and it\u2019s disappointing\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Rebekka Schaffner lay on an exam bed in an Idaho clinic, pale pink and blue straps curving over her pregnant stomach, as she listened to the rapid \u201cwhoosh\u201d-ing of her in-utero baby\u2019s heart.</p> \n<p>Because Schaffner\u2019s pregnancy is high risk, the 34-year-old mother regularly undergoes tests to check that all is well. The threat of Idaho\u2019s abortion ban, and how it may affect her life if the pregnancy goes wrong, weighs on Schaffner. She\u2019s already felt the effects of the ban \u2013 twice.</p> \n<p>Last year, Schaffner had a miscarriage that left fetal remains inside her body, she said. Before Roe fell, doctors might have treated Schaffner with a routine procedure known as a dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C \u2013 but Schaffner said they were too fearful of Idaho\u2019s ban to perform the procedure. She ended up in the hospital with an infection, Schaffer said. \u201cHad they handled it properly prior, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten sick,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Dr Loren Colson, a family medicine doctor in Boise, Idaho, said that abortion laws are so confusing, some medical providers are unwilling to treat miscarriages. When his own wife had a miscarriage, Colson said,<strong> </strong>a pharmacist refused to fill a prescription to treat it.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if it does seem clear cut, some people are like: \u2018If the punishment is jail time, I\u2019m just not going to do this,\u2019\u201d Colson said. When he\u2019s working with patients, \u201cif there\u2019s any concern that a patient might need an abortion or might need a D&amp;C for stabilizing care, we don\u2019t even come close to that line. We send them out to Seattle or even Utah, [which] has better laws.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Schaffner realized she was pregnant again, she became profoundly anxious. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to potentially end up having another miscarriage and be right back in that position again, of being told what I could and couldn\u2019t do, what was available to me,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Twenty weeks into her pregnancy, Schaffner\u2019s cervix started to dilate, she said. Her doctors stitched her cervix closed to keep her from delivering too early, but the procedure carried a small risk of breaking Schaffner\u2019s water too early. Had that happened \u2013 a condition known as premature prelabor rupture of membranes, or PPROM \u2013 Schaffner\u2019s pregnancy would have been in effect over, because there would be no way for her to deliver a healthy baby.</p> \n<p>Complications from untreated PPROM can be deadly, but since Roe fell, many women have been denied treatment for the<strong> </strong>condition. When one Texan woman, Amanda Zurawski, developed PPROM, she was unable to get an abortion, contracted sepsis and ended up spending three days in the ICU. Other women have suffered life-threatening blood loss after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/state-abortion-bans-doctor-care-pregnancy\">doctors delayed treating their miscarriages</a>.</p> \n<p>Should she develop PPROM, Schaffner said, she planned to go out of state for care.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary and it\u2019s disappointing, knowing that if something went wrong in the process of trying to save the baby, that there wasn\u2019t anything else they could do,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have to be sent to another state to have my daughter and lose her.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adkins was ultimately able to get an abortion at a clinic in Oregon, a six-hour drive away from her home in the Boise area, in April 2023. An abortion fund helped her cover the costs, but being away from her home state and the providers who knew her was<strong> </strong>wrenching. As she spoke, Adkins started to cry. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly cruel side-effect of these bans, to put bereaved parents through a loss like that.\u201d</p> \n<p>In September 2023, Adkins became one of four women to sue Idaho over being denied a medically necessary abortion. Her lawsuit urges the state to clarify the scope of its medical exceptions, but it has not yet gone to trial. A similar lawsuit, in Texas, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/31/texas-abortion-ban-medical-exceptions-supreme-court-ruling\">shut down in May</a> by the state\u2019s supreme court.</p> \n<p>Adkins has since given birth to a second child. Afterward, Adkins got an IUD.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow that the stakes are extremely high with this election, we decided to take a little bit firmer stance on how we were going to prevent pregnancy from happening,\u201d said<strong> </strong>Adkins, as she nursed her infant. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of access to care I\u2019m going to have.\u201d</p>",

As the home of what may be the strictest abortion ban in the country, Idaho is a cautionary tale about what can happen when the right to abortion disappears: droves of doctors have fled the state, which already had rising rates of maternal and infant mortality, and the state has become a laboratory for testing other laws meant to limit support for abortion patients. \u201cThose opposed to abortion access and reproductive healthcare access have had a playbook for a really long time, and Idaho is a textbook example of their playbook,\u201d said Jessica Waters, an American University professor who studies reproductive rights. \u201cEverything that\u2019s happening in Idaho is a playbook, I think, for what could happen in the rest of the country.\u201d What a Trump administration could mean for abortion nationally If Donald Trump wins the presidency in November, even abortion access for women in blue states may be under threat. Although Trump \u2013 who appointed three of the justices who overturned Roe \u2013 recently claimed that he would veto a national ban, he has repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue. And a Trump administration would not need Congress to wreak havoc on abortion access nationwide or to in effect ban the procedure. Project 2025, the controversial policy playbook for a future conservative administration, proposes using the Comstock Act, an 1873 anti-vice law that outlaws the mailing of abortion-related materials, to ban people from shipping abortion pills. These pills currently account for about two-thirds of US abortions; they can also be used to safely self-induce an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Some anti-abortion activists believe the Comstock Act can do even more: if enacted to its fullest extent, it could not only ban pills but the very equipment that clinics need to do their jobs. Without ever involving Congress, Trump could use the Comstock Act to implement a nationwide de facto abortion ban. And if he doesn\u2019t, the courts could: anti-abortion activists have begun to seed lawsuits throughout the country that cite Comstock, while the supreme court\u2019s far-right justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, both brought up the 151-year-old law in recent arguments. Trump could also step back from enforcing a federal law that protects access to emergency abortions. Over the last year, Idaho has been at the center of the debate over this law, a debate that recently made its way to the US supreme court. The law \u2013 the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or Emtala \u2013 requires hospitals to stabilize patients who show up at their doors in the midst of a medical emergency or transport them to a hospital that can do so. But Idaho\u2019s abortion ban only permits abortions in medical emergencies when a patient\u2019s life is at stake \u2013 an exception, the Biden administration argued to the supreme court, that is so narrow it violates Emtala. Idaho pushed back, arguing in part that the federal government can\u2019t compel doctors to offer care that is illegal under state law. The supreme court essentially punted on whether Emtala extends to emergency abortions. The justices restored a lower court order that lets Idaho doctors perform a broader range of emergency abortions, but left the door open to reconsider Emtala in the future. Without a Democrat in the White House to fight it, Idaho\u2019s interpretation of Emtala could end up becoming a widespread standard. \u2018These are not normal conversations\u2019 Many doctors have left Idaho rather than work under its ban. In the 15 months after Idaho\u2019s ban took effect, 22% of Idaho obstetricians stopped working in the state, according to a report by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative and the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare. Three labor and delivery wards have closed. More than half of the state\u2019s nine maternal fetal medicine specialists have left or stopped working in the state full-time. Dr Kylie Cooper is one of them. \u201cIt was a very real concern of mine that a situation would come up that somebody requires abortion care that I cannot provide, or that I am providing and at risk of being charged with a felony and going to prison,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI lost a lot of sleep over it.\u201d Cooper and her husband tried to game out the logistics of Cooper being arrested. Would she go to jail immediately? Could she get bail? What would that mean for their small children? Eventually, Cooper thought: \u201cWhat are we even doing? \u201cThese are not normal conversations. These are not conversations that I ever anticipated having in my medical career, in my life,\u201d she continued. \u201cThinking about myself and my family and my future patients, we made the really difficult decision to leave the state because of the bans.\u201d She now works in Minnesota. In interviews by the Guardian with nearly a dozen Idaho-based OB-GYNs and family medicine physicians \u2013 two specialties that tend to handle pregnancy \u2013 over the last year, every one said that they had considered leaving the state, if not the country. Experts are still trying to calculate the impact of abortion bans on infant and maternal mortality, but one study linked a Texas abortion ban to a 13% increase in the number of infants who died in their first year of life. At least two women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, died after being unable to access legal abortions in their home state of Georgia, which bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, according to recent reporting by ProPublica. Experts deemed both of their deaths \u201cpreventable\u201d. Idaho has also sought to limit access to abortion in other ways. In 2023, the state created the crime of \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d when it passed a law banning people from taking minors across state lines for legal abortions if their parents had not consented. That same year, Idaho\u2019s Republican attorney general, Ra\u00fal Labrador, issued a legal opinion claiming that Idaho law blocked medical professionals from even referring people for legal out-of-state abortions. Separately, Idaho professors and teachers\u2019 unions sued over a law that makes it a crime to use public funds to \u201cpromote\u201d or \u201ccounsel in favor of abortion\u201d. . Courts have since blocked the abortion trafficking law and the attorney general\u2019s legal opinion from taking effect, while dismissing the teachers\u2019 lawsuit after Labrador said academic speech about abortion was not prohibited under Idaho law. However, four other states have since introduced abortion trafficking legislation. One of those states, Tennessee, has passed it. \u2018It\u2019s scary and it\u2019s disappointing\u2019 Rebekka Schaffner lay on an exam bed in an Idaho clinic, pale pink and blue straps curving over her pregnant stomach, as she listened to the rapid \u201cwhoosh\u201d-ing of her in-utero baby\u2019s heart. Because Schaffner\u2019s pregnancy is high risk, the 34-year-old mother regularly undergoes tests to check that all is well. The threat of Idaho\u2019s abortion ban, and how it may affect her life if the pregnancy goes wrong, weighs on Schaffner. She\u2019s already felt the effects of the ban \u2013 twice. Last year, Schaffner had a miscarriage that left fetal remains inside her body, she said. Before Roe fell, doctors might have treated Schaffner with a routine procedure known as a dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C \u2013 but Schaffner said they were too fearful of Idaho\u2019s ban to perform the procedure. She ended up in the hospital with an infection, Schaffer said. \u201cHad they handled it properly prior, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten sick,\u201d she said. Dr Loren Colson, a family medicine doctor in Boise, Idaho, said that abortion laws are so confusing, some medical providers are unwilling to treat miscarriages. When his own wife had a miscarriage, Colson said, a pharmacist refused to fill a prescription to treat it. \u201cEven if it does seem clear cut, some people are like: \u2018If the punishment is jail time, I\u2019m just not going to do this,\u2019\u201d Colson said. When he\u2019s working with patients, \u201cif there\u2019s any concern that a patient might need an abortion or might need a D&amp;C for stabilizing care, we don\u2019t even come close to that line. We send them out to Seattle or even Utah, [which] has better laws.\u201d When Schaffner realized she was pregnant again, she became profoundly anxious. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to potentially end up having another miscarriage and be right back in that position again, of being told what I could and couldn\u2019t do, what was available to me,\u201d she said. Twenty weeks into her pregnancy, Schaffner\u2019s cervix started to dilate, she said. Her doctors stitched her cervix closed to keep her from delivering too early, but the procedure carried a small risk of breaking Schaffner\u2019s water too early. Had that happened \u2013 a condition known as premature prelabor rupture of membranes, or PPROM \u2013 Schaffner\u2019s pregnancy would have been in effect over, because there would be no way for her to deliver a healthy baby. Complications from untreated PPROM can be deadly, but since Roe fell, many women have been denied treatment for the condition. When one Texan woman, Amanda Zurawski, developed PPROM, she was unable to get an abortion, contracted sepsis and ended up spending three days in the ICU. Other women have suffered life-threatening blood loss after doctors delayed treating their miscarriages. Should she develop PPROM, Schaffner said, she planned to go out of state for care. \u201cIt\u2019s scary and it\u2019s disappointing, knowing that if something went wrong in the process of trying to save the baby, that there wasn\u2019t anything else they could do,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have to be sent to another state to have my daughter and lose her.\u201d Adkins was ultimately able to get an abortion at a clinic in Oregon, a six-hour drive away from her home in the Boise area, in April 2023. An abortion fund helped her cover the costs, but being away from her home state and the providers who knew her was wrenching. As she spoke, Adkins started to cry. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly cruel side-effect of these bans, to put bereaved parents through a loss like that.\u201d In September 2023, Adkins became one of four women to sue Idaho over being denied a medically necessary abortion. Her lawsuit urges the state to clarify the scope of its medical exceptions, but it has not yet gone to trial. A similar lawsuit, in Texas, was shut down in May by the state\u2019s supreme court. Adkins has since given birth to a second child. Afterward, Adkins got an IUD. \u201cNow that the stakes are extremely high with this election, we decided to take a little bit firmer stance on how we were going to prevent pregnancy from happening,\u201d said Adkins, as she nursed her infant. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of access to care I\u2019m going to have.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The pop culture of past generations weighs like a dark cloud on the youth of today. Teenagers may have their own subcultures but the mainstream is all nostalgia. The big films are sequels, remakes or long-running sagas. The most watched shows on Netflix are 90s sitcoms, or paeans to the past like Stranger Things. The main stage at Glastonbury is full of OAPs performing tribute acts to their youth. The top music story of 2024 is the return of Oasis, a band whose songwriter was born during the Wilson administration.</p> <p>This is all a function of the internet, which makes the past ever-present in easily accessible form, leaving little space for the new or innovative. In a slightly more subtle way it\u2019s doing the same thing to politics, with more severe consequences than Champagne Supernova being played incessantly on the radio.</p> <p>This is most visible in the decline of the Conservatives, who have essentially become a boomer Facebook group in the guise of a political party. Their leadership contest has already seen calls for the return of grammar schools (most of which closed before anyone under the age of 60 could have attended one) as well as the standard attacks on \u201cmilitant trade union barons\u201d, as if they were still all bolshie miners rather than mostly female graduates in the public sector. At party conference, leadership hopeful Kemi Badenoch suggested that statutory maternity pay (introduced in 1987) and the minimum wage (1999) were among the innovations putting an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/29/maternity-pay-is-excessive-says-tory-leadership-hopeful-kemi-badenoch\">undue burden on businesses</a>.</p> <p>Most of all there is the worship of St Margaret, with the leadership candidates falling over each other in their haste to condemn Keir Starmer for moving her portrait from one room in Downing Street to another, and Robert Jenrick <a href=\"https://x.com/jessicaelgot/status/1841102812500910439\">revealing</a> his daughter\u2019s middle name is Thatcher. It\u2019s not quite as bad as the 2022 contest, when Liz Truss literally <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/liz-truss-prime-minister-thatcher-cabinet-treasury-b2160608.html\">dressed up as the former prime minister</a> while recreating her most famous photoshoots, but it\u2019s not far off.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Our most transformative prime ministers have departed from a stale consensus and tried a different approach</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This doesn\u2019t just matter because of the fusty vibes it gives the party but because they\u2019re tied to supporting a rhetorical agenda that no longer makes sense. The political challenges of the future lie around climate change, AI and the rising cost of public services. The Conservatives are talking about grammar schools, right to buy, and bringing back national service. It feels like we\u2019re only a speech or two away from calling for the return of \u201cproper binmen\u201d, as per the nostalgia-drenched Facebook meme.</p> <p>It\u2019s hardly surprising, given all this, that, according to the pollster YouGov, just 13% of people under the age of 50 voted Tory at the election, compared with 42% of pensioners. This age split is not typical: as recently as 2015 the party got 34% among under-50s. It\u2019s hard to see how they can recover without breaking free from this backwards-looking politics, but they daren\u2019t risk alienating their remaining base, who are still voting for them because they remember the winter of discontent.</p> <p>Labour aren\u2019t, yet, as badly trapped by the past, and did much better with younger voters (though they didn\u2019t win a majority of votes in any age group). But they are at risk of turning Tony Blair into their own Thatcher-like totem.</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s policy agenda has important differences from Blair\u2019s. For a start it\u2019s more statist, as we can see&nbsp;with the renationalisation of the railway lines that aren\u2019t already back in public ownership, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/25/great-british-energy-ed-miliband-labour-clean-power\">Ed Miliband\u2019s creation of the state-owned GB Energy</a>. The prime&nbsp;minister\u2019s personal politics are to the left of his&nbsp;predecessor\u2019s.</p> <p>But Starmer made sure to get Blair\u2019s personal blessing at a conference held by the latter\u2019s thinktank before the election, and has subsequently hired a load of Blair-era advisers. His effective number two in Downing Street is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pat-mcfadden\">Pat McFadden</a>, who was Blair\u2019s political secretary. His director of communications, Matthew Doyle, was the deputy director under Blair. His new \u201cadviser on effective delivery\u201d, Michael Barber, made his name running Blair\u2019s delivery unit.

      "bodyText": "The pop culture of past generations weighs like a dark cloud on the youth of today. Teenagers may have their own subcultures but the mainstream is all nostalgia. The big films are sequels, remakes or long-running sagas. The most watched shows on Netflix are 90s sitcoms, or paeans to the past like Stranger Things. The main stage at Glastonbury is full of OAPs performing tribute acts to their youth. The top music story of 2024 is the return of Oasis, a band whose songwriter was born during the Wilson administration. This is all a function of the internet, which makes the past ever-present in easily accessible form, leaving little space for the new or innovative. In a slightly more subtle way it\u2019s doing the same thing to politics, with more severe consequences than Champagne Supernova being played incessantly on the radio. This is most visible in the decline of the Conservatives, who have essentially become a boomer Facebook group in the guise of a political party. Their leadership contest has already seen calls for the return of grammar schools (most of which closed before anyone under the age of 60 could have attended one) as well as the standard attacks on \u201cmilitant trade union barons\u201d, as if they were still all bolshie miners rather than mostly female graduates in the public sector. At party conference, leadership hopeful Kemi Badenoch suggested that statutory maternity pay (introduced in 1987) and the minimum wage (1999) were among the innovations putting an undue burden on businesses. Most of all there is the worship of St Margaret, with the leadership candidates falling over each other in their haste to condemn Keir Starmer for moving her portrait from one room in Downing Street to another, and Robert Jenrick revealing his daughter\u2019s middle name is Thatcher. It\u2019s not quite as bad as the 2022 contest, when Liz Truss literally dressed up as the former prime minister while recreating her most famous photoshoots, but it\u2019s not far off. This doesn\u2019t just matter because of the fusty vibes it gives the party but because they\u2019re tied to supporting a rhetorical agenda that no longer makes sense. The political challenges of the future lie around climate change, AI and the rising cost of public services. The Conservatives are talking about grammar schools, right to buy, and bringing back national service. It feels like we\u2019re only a speech or two away from calling for the return of \u201cproper binmen\u201d, as per the nostalgia-drenched Facebook meme. It\u2019s hardly surprising, given all this, that, according to the pollster YouGov, just 13% of people under the age of 50 voted Tory at the election, compared with 42% of pensioners. This age split is not typical: as recently as 2015 the party got 34% among under-50s. It\u2019s hard to see how they can recover without breaking free from this backwards-looking politics, but they daren\u2019t risk alienating their remaining base, who are still voting for them because they remember the winter of discontent. Labour aren\u2019t, yet, as badly trapped by the past, and did much better with younger voters (though they didn\u2019t win a majority of votes in any age group). But they are at risk of turning Tony Blair into their own Thatcher-like totem. Starmer\u2019s policy agenda has important differences from Blair\u2019s. For a start it\u2019s more statist, as we can see with the renationalisation of the railway lines that aren\u2019t already back in public ownership, and Ed Miliband\u2019s creation of the state-owned GB Energy. The prime minister\u2019s personal politics are to the left of his predecessor\u2019s. But Starmer made sure to get Blair\u2019s personal blessing at a conference held by the latter\u2019s thinktank before the election, and has subsequently hired a load of Blair-era advisers. His effective number two in Downing Street is Pat McFadden, who was Blair\u2019s political secretary. His director of communications, Matthew Doyle, was the deputy director under Blair. His new \u201cadviser on effective delivery\u201d, Michael Barber, made his name running Blair\u2019s delivery unit. A whole swathe of New Labour ministers from Alan Milburn to Jacqui Smith have been brought back as advisers or Lords ministers. There is a logic to staffing up an inexperienced team with those who served Labour\u2019s most electorally successful leader. Yet, as with the Tories, the challenges of today are not the same as 1997.

      "body": "<p>In 2017, at the end of his first year at Samford University, a private Christian university in Birmingham, Alabama, Nathan Peace realized he\u2019d never \u201cpray the gay away\u201d and he\u2019d never \u201cturn straight\u201d.</p> <p>Peace had grown up in a \u201cchurchy\u201d family in Georgia and attended Southern Baptist services his entire life. In high school, he showed up early for Bible study and participated in group prayers before marching band performances. In the 2016 election, he voted for Donald Trump. It\u2019s what he thought he had to do to be a \u201cfaithful\u201d Christian.</p> <p>But for years Peace had remained closeted, agonizing over his sexuality. As far as he knew, he could be gay or he could be a Christian \u2013 but he could never be both.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came out as gay, that was the major faith reckoning, because I grew up in a very conservative context. I did not know gay people,\u201d Peace, now 27, said. \u201cIt was in that process that I said, \u2018What is my faith? What am I doing? What is left of me after this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Peace had begun deconstructing.</p> <p>The term deconstruction has risen in popularity in recent years, particularly in evangelical Christian circles. It describes a process in which people strip back and challenge the core of their religious beliefs, often because their values are in conflict with those of their church. Those who deconstruct \u2013 sometimes called \u201cexvangelicals\u201d \u2013 may be prompted to do so by their church\u2019s treatment of LGBTQ+ people, its tolerance of racism, misogyny and sexual abuse, or its embrace of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jul/30/inside-christian-purity-guides-joshua-harris-mike-pence-rule\">purity culture</a>.</p>    <p>Deconstruction is not quick or easy. Because religion can be ingrained and habitual, the interfaith minister the Rev Karla Kamstra calls it a \u201cspiritual untangling\u201d. \u201cThe main part of that is really learning to understand what it means to let go and release and heal from the things that no longer serve your highest good,\u201d said Kamstra, author of the new book Deconstructing: Leaving Church, Finding Faith.</p> <p>The number of Americans who identify as Christian is shrinking. According to Pew Research Center, about 28% of US adults now fit the category of <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2024/01/24/religious-nones-in-america-who-they-are-and-what-they-believe/\">religious nones</a> \u2013 a group that identifies as atheist, agnostic or \u201cnothing in particular\u201d \u2013 while the number of adults who <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/how-u-s-religious-composition-has-changed-in-recent-decades/\">identify as Christian</a> has steadily declined since 2007. A third of US adults in their 30s who were <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/how-u-s-religious-composition-has-changed-in-recent-decades/#:~:text=However%2C%20among%20people%20in%20their,unaffiliated%20who%20still%20are%20today.\">raised Christian</a> no longer identify as such.</p> <p>In today\u2019s changing religious landscape, deconstructing Christians are thoughtfully, deliberately asking themselves: \u201cCan I remain in the church, or will I have to leave the faith altogether?\u201d Discovering the answer can be an emotionally wrenching process.</p> <h2>Unraveling religion</h2> <p>As freshman year came to a close, Peace sent an email to his campus minister, April Robinson: \u201cI just wanted to reach out about something I\u2019ve been struggling with,\u201d he wrote. Robinson\u2019s subsequent guidance was invaluable in the early days of his deconstruction. Together, they created a reading list so Peace could begin learning what other Christians had to say about \u201csame-sex attraction\u201d. Robinson ordered and loaned him books, and assured him that he wasn\u2019t the first to walk this path. Peace hunkered down in his dorm room to read.</p> <p>Notably, the Bible was not on Peace\u2019s reading list. As he wrestled with his sexuality in his youth, the Bible had seemed oppressive. Once he began deconstructing, he didn\u2019t touch it: it was still meaningful to him, but he wanted space to determine how to ascribe its authority in his life. Instead, he read books like God and the Gay Christian by Matthew Vines and Changing Our Mind by David Gushee.</p> <p>Robinson continued following Peace\u2019s lead. When he heard compelling cases about gay-affirming Christians, she connected him with a local pastor who helped him explore where he stood theologically. She also referred him to a therapist.</p> <p>The Southern Baptist Convention condemns homosexuality and defines marriage as \u201cthe uniting of one man and one woman in covenant commitment for a lifetime\u201d. So when Peace began deconstructing his Southern Baptist background, a world of difficult questions opened. If he was gay, what did that mean for his relationship with God? What did that mean for his politics? Questions about same-sex relationships led to questions about misogyny, which led to questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/southern-baptist-church-female-pastors-expelled\">gender roles in the Southern Baptist church</a>, like whether women should be allowed to serve as pastors. It was all entangled.</p>    <p>Deconstruction creates a sense of cognitive dissonance, according to Daryl Van Tongeren, professor of psychology at Hope College, and there are two ways to deal with it: \u201cYou either get the world to fit according to your views, or you need to change your views to fit the world.\u201d</p> <p>Religious mentors like Robinson help some navigate these diverging paths. Others find support in online communities. Kamstra, who was raised Southern Baptist, runs a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@revkarla?lang=en\">TikTok account</a> with more than 700,000 followers, where she posts about Bible study, prayer and the politics of the Christian right. The massively popular YouTube duo <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/video/watch/google-autocomplete-inverviews-rhett-and-link-answer-the-webs-new-most-searched-questions\">Rhett and Link</a> have posted and podcasted about their \u201clong, grueling, painful\u201d journeys from Christian evangelicalism, becoming something of online figureheads for deconstruction (they say they\u2019re in a \u201cgood spot\u201d now). Across comment sections, subreddits and tweet threads, individuals going through deconstruction share frustrating experiences, ask for advice and seek solace.</p> <p>After deconstructing, some leave the faith entirely. Perhaps that\u2019s why certain Christian leaders see deconstruction as a threat. Matt Chandler, a baptist pastor based in Texas, preached a sermon in 2021 <a href=\"https://relevantmagazine.com/faith/church/reminder-deconstruction-does-not-mean-deconversion/\">condemning it</a> as a \u201csexy thing to do\u201d and suggesting that those who deconstructed never had a true faith. Tim Barnett, a Christian speaker, thought it could be healthy but <a href=\"https://www.str.org/w/why-i-changed-my-mind-about-deconstruction\">now says</a> it is \u201cantithetical to the Christian worldview\u201d.</p> <p>Other leaders are more open to it. Before his death in 2023, Dr Tim Keller, founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian church in New York City, <a href=\"https://gospelinlife.com/article/reconstructing-faith/\">wrote that deconstruction</a> was a chance for Christians to \u201cemerge stronger\u201d if done \u201cconstructively\u201d. Some have spoken out about it as a <a href=\"https://www.christiancentury.org/deconstructed-faith-choi\">healthy renewal of one\u2019s faith</a> that signals where American Christianity is heading.</p> <p>Peace was reckoning with his faith and accepting his sexuality while navigating a conservative college campus, and things were growing tense with people in his life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You either get the world to fit according to your views, or you need to change your views to fit the world</p> <footer> <cite>Daryl Van Tongeren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Deconstruction is fraught with social consequences, said Terry Shoemaker, an associate teaching professor at the School of Historical, Philosophical, and Religious Studies at Arizona State University. Because religion is closely linked to family and friendships, one risks a loss of community and estrangement from loved ones.</p> <p>\u201cIt interweaves things so tightly that if you pull on one thread, that braid really starts to unravel. All other forms of identity start to come into question, because if this one thing doesn\u2019t match up, well then, maybe other things don\u2019t match up,\u201d Shoemaker said.</p> <p>One of the threads woven into Peace\u2019s braid was his politics. \u201cPart of my deconstruction was saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not the way of Jesus,\u2019\u201d Peace said of his 2016 vote for Trump. He had done what he\u2019d been taught was right, but now realized his politics caused more harm than good. \u201cAs a queer person, I don\u2019t know how I could vote for that.\u201d</p> <p>In the 2020 election, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/08/30/most-white-americans-who-regularly-attend-worship-services-voted-for-trump-in-2020/#:~:text=Trump%20expanded%20his%20support%20among,%25%20support%20in%20both%20elections).\">84% of white evangelical Christians</a> voted for Trump. Aside from Black Christians, <a href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/christian-voters-will-play-outsized-role-us-election\">practicing Christians lean Republican</a>, and evangelical Christians \u2013 including Southern Baptists \u2013 are broadly associated with restrictive, conservative stances on issues like abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. But Christians might find the label \u201cevangelical\u201d problematic, particularly with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/trump-religious-extremism-rightwing-evangelicals\">rise of the evangelical right</a>, and no longer wish to be associated with it. That can be reason enough to begin deconstructing.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more of a sociopolitical term or moniker than it is a religious one, and so some people leave religion because they don\u2019t like the label,\u201d Van Tongeren said.</p> <p>Those who land outside of religion after deconstruction have \u201cde-identified\u201d, according to Van Tongeren. But religion is sticky. \u201cWe call [it] religious residue, the idea that one\u2019s religious past lingers or continues to have an effect on them long after they\u2019ve de-identified,\u201d he said. This residue can manifest in values, politics, beliefs about God and spending habits. Those who de-identify might seek spiritual meaning outside of organized religion. \u201cSo even though people have walked away from religion, religion continues to exert an effect on them.\u201d</p> <p>Deconstructing left Peace with a sense of grief as he mourned the loss of his church and community. But he was unwilling to walk away from Christianity. In fact, it was this period of deconstruction that helped Peace keep his faith.</p> <p>\u201cI very much had a desire to take apart my faith but come up with something that was going to be much more life giving,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This rebuilding of faith is what Van Tongeren calls \u201creconstruction\u201d.</p> <p>After his freshman year, Peace spent years reading from Christians with varying beliefs, conversing with friends and mentors, and watching sermons and talks. He attended a progressive Baptist church near campus, but was thinking more long term. Really, he was looking for a place to belong.</p> <p>So in 2019, at the beginning of his senior year, Peace received a grant from the Forum for Theological Exploration and planned a visit to Washington DC with intentions to visit several Baptist churches in the area. On a whim he ended up at the National Cathedral \u2013 a cathedral of the Episcopal church. It was a Sunday.</p> <p>As he walked through the doors, the late evening sun leaked through stained glass windows, illuminating bleeding reds, vivid sapphire and blazing golds. Images of the throne of God and other scenes from the Book of Revelation were on display.</p> <p>As he settled into the wooden pews, Peace noticed another young man sitting nearby. He took it as a good sign. The organ rang out through the lofty ceilings, and as the choir\u2019s voices filled the halls, an intense feeling of comfort overcame Peace. A voice, which he identified as the Holy Spirit, whispered to him: \u201cYou\u2019re home. This is your home.\u201d</p> <p>He returned the following Sunday.</p>    <h2>Welcomed, not shunned</h2> <p>Today, Peace is a student at Yale Divinity School, studying for his master of divinity degree. When he graduates next year, he hopes to be ordained as an Episcopal priest. Finding a home within Christianity didn\u2019t end the deconstruction process for Peace. It freed him to continue.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that among my Episcopal colleagues I have the exact same theological framework,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they also don\u2019t have the same theological framework among themselves. It\u2019s a safe place to deconstruct.\u201d</p> <p>In 1974, the American Episcopal church ordained its first female priests, and in 2003, it elected its first out gay bishop. By 2012, it was the largest US Protestant denomination to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/07/11/156597630/episcopal-church-oks-same-sex-blessings-largest-u-s-denomination-to-do-so#:~:text=With%20a%20vote%20Tuesday%20evening,as%20CNN's%20Belief%20blog%20writes.\">officially approve</a> same-sex relationships, and it has since taken up progressive stances on environmental issues, gun rights and immigration. But members still <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/religious-denomination/episcopal-church/political-ideology/\">range across the political spectrum</a> \u2013 31% are conservative, 37% are moderate, and 29% are liberal, per Pew.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I sort of wonder, why didn\u2019t I just get out? But I can\u2019t. Where would I go?</p> <footer> <cite>Nathan Peace</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Peace, there\u2019s something special about being in community with people who aren\u2019t exactly like him, whom he can learn from and be challenged by. Time away from the Bible has helped him learn to feel welcomed by it, not shunned. He also loves knowing that on any given Sunday, he can walk into an Episcopal church and hear the recitation of the Nicene Creed.<em> </em>He can read and rely on the Book of Common Prayer. In part, this communal confession and clear statement of belief is what drew him to the Episcopal church.</p> <p>\u201cBelief is not mine and my own. Belief is ours,\u201d Peace said. \u201cIf the person next to me can say something with conviction, then somehow, some way, by the spirit of God, that can count for the two of us.\u201d</p> <p>Now, when he talks about God, the Bible and his faith, Peace brightens. He tearfully explains the kinship he feels to the Apostle Peter in John 6, for he too can imagine his place nowhere but in companionship with Jesus. He laughs when he explains that it\u2019s OK to take issue with biblical passages, like 1 Corinthians and Philemon, both of which he finds concerning. He\u2019s solemn as he describes how seriously he takes prayer. Before deconstruction, it would have been much harder to articulate these feelings.</p> <p>Peace sometimes wonders if it would have been easier to leave Christianity altogether.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many times when I deal with family, deal with the community that raised me, that I sort of wonder, why didn\u2019t I just get out?\u201d Peace said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. I look at Jesus and I say, \u2018Where would I go?\u2019 I don\u2019t know where I would go.\u201d</p>",

It describes a process in which people strip back and challenge the core of their religious beliefs, often because their values are in conflict with those of their church. Those who deconstruct \u2013 sometimes called \u201cexvangelicals\u201d \u2013 may be prompted to do so by their church\u2019s treatment of LGBTQ+ people, its tolerance of racism, misogyny and sexual abuse, or its embrace of purity culture.

A third of US adults in their 30s who were raised Christian no longer identify as such. In today\u2019s changing religious landscape, deconstructing Christians are thoughtfully, deliberately asking themselves: \u201cCan I remain in the church, or will I have to leave the faith altogether?\u201d Discovering the answer can be an emotionally wrenching process.

He attended a progressive Baptist church near campus, but was thinking more long term. Really, he was looking for a place to belong. So in 2019, at the beginning of his senior year, Peace received a grant from the Forum for Theological Exploration and planned a visit to Washington DC with intentions to visit several Baptist churches in the area. On a whim he ended up at the National Cathedral \u2013 a cathedral of the Episcopal church. It was a Sunday. As he walked through the doors, the late evening sun leaked through stained glass windows, illuminating bleeding reds, vivid sapphire and blazing golds. Images of the throne of God and other scenes from the Book of Revelation were on display. As he settled into the wooden pews, Peace noticed another young man sitting nearby. He took it as a good sign. The organ rang out through the lofty ceilings, and as the choir\u2019s voices filled the halls, an intense feeling of comfort overcame Peace. A voice, which he identified as the Holy Spirit, whispered to him: \u201cYou\u2019re home. This is your home.\u201d He returned the following Sunday. Welcomed, not shunned Today, Peace is a student at Yale Divinity School, studying for his master of divinity degree. When he graduates next year, he hopes to be ordained as an Episcopal priest. Finding a home within Christianity didn\u2019t end the deconstruction process for Peace. It freed him to continue. \u201cI can\u2019t say that among my Episcopal colleagues I have the exact same theological framework,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they also don\u2019t have the same theological framework among themselves. It\u2019s a safe place to deconstruct.\u201d In 1974, the American Episcopal church ordained its first female priests, and in 2003, it elected its first out gay bishop. By 2012, it was the largest US Protestant denomination to officially approve same-sex relationships, and it has since taken up progressive stances on environmental issues, gun rights and immigration. But members still range across the political spectrum \u2013 31% are conservative, 37% are moderate, and 29% are liberal, per Pew. For Peace, there\u2019s something special about being in community with people who aren\u2019t exactly like him, whom he can learn from and be challenged by. Time away from the Bible has helped him learn to feel welcomed by it, not shunned. He also loves knowing that on any given Sunday, he can walk into an Episcopal church and hear the recitation of the Nicene Creed. He can read and rely on the Book of Common Prayer. In part, this communal confession and clear statement of belief is what drew him to the Episcopal church. \u201cBelief is not mine and my own. Belief is ours,\u201d Peace said. \u201cIf the person next to me can say something with conviction, then somehow, some way, by the spirit of God, that can count for the two of us.\u201d Now, when he talks about God, the Bible and his faith, Peace brightens. He tearfully explains the kinship he feels to the Apostle Peter in John 6, for he too can imagine his place nowhere but in companionship with Jesus. He laughs when he explains that it\u2019s OK to take issue with biblical passages, like 1 Corinthians and Philemon, both of which he finds concerning. He\u2019s solemn as he describes how seriously he takes prayer. Before deconstruction, it would have been much harder to articulate these feelings. Peace sometimes wonders if it would have been easier to leave Christianity altogether. \u201cThere are many times when I deal with family, deal with the community that raised me, that I sort of wonder, why didn\u2019t I just get out?\u201d Peace said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. I look at Jesus and I say, \u2018Where would I go?\u2019 I don\u2019t know where I would go.\u201d",

Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militia who follow the former warlord <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/mohamed-hamdan-dagalo-the-feared-ex-warlord-taking-on-sudan-army-hemedti\">Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo</a>, known as Hemedti.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/dec/30/survivors-give-harrowing-testimony-of-darfur-sudan-year-of-hell\">\u2018They told us \u2013 you are slaves\u2019: survivors give harrowing testimony of Darfur\u2019s year of hell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The RSF was founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia. Bashir wanted to crush a rebellion in the region of Darfur that began more than 20 years ago due to the political and economic marginalisation of the local population.</p>    <p>Initially known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/24/rsf-janjaweed-hemedti-out-to-finish-darfur-sudan-genocide-uk-cannot-stand-by\">Janjaweed</a>, the RSF quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into a semi-organised paramilitary force and gave its leaders military ranks before deploying it to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur.</p> <p>Hemedti\u2019s power struggle with Burhan can be traced back to 2019 when the RSF and regular military forces cooperated to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/12/sudanese-protesters-jubilant-after-military-leader-rapidly-replaced\">oust Bashir</a> from power. When attempts to transition to a democratic civilian-led government faltered, many analysts felt an eventual showdown between Burhan and Hemedti was inevitable.</p> <h2>What has been the human cost?</h2> <p>The conflict has plunged Sudan into what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/24/sudanese-evacuees-in-the-uk-fear-limbo-as-six-month-visas-begin-to-expire#:~:text=Up%20to%209%2C000%20people%20have,humanitarian%20nightmares%20in%20recent%20history%E2%80%9D.\">UN has described as</a> \u201cone of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history\u201d. Tens of thousands have died, millions have been displaced, and hunger and disease are rife.</p> <p>According to the most recent figures, about 26 million people face severe food insecurity. Famine has been declared in the Zamzam displacement camp in Darfur.</p> <p>About 11.3 million people have been forced to flee the fighting, including nearly 2.95 million who have fled across the country\u2019s borders. Most have gone to Chad and South Sudan, where underfunded aid agencies say they are struggling to meet basic needs. A UN appeal for $1.51bn to support Sudanese refugees and their hosts in the region through the end of the year remains just 27% funded.</p>    <p>In its latest humanitarian update, published on 1 October, the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said significant declines in vaccination rates and the destruction of health infrastructure resulting from the war mean Sudan is grappling with multiple disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, dengue fever, measles, and rubella. An estimated 3.4 million children under the age of five are at high risk of epidemic diseases, according to Unicef.</p> <p>The conflict has also robbed huge numbers of an education. More than 90% of the country\u2019s 19 million school-age children are unable to access formal education. Schools have been targeted in airstrikes, occupied by armed groups and used to store weapons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/chadrefugees-zip/giv-4559EQb7GGMFs8x2\" data-alt=\"Chad refugees chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/chadrefugees-zip/giv-4559EQb7GGMFs8x2\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>What atrocities are the warring sides accused of?</h2> <p>The UN has accused the army and the RSF of carrying out indiscriminate attacks in residential areas, committing acts of sexual violence, arbitrarily detaining and torturing civilians and recruiting child soldiers. Both parties may have committed war crimes, a UN report in February said. They have denied the claims.</p> <p>The US went a step further last year, declaring that both had carried out war crimes and that the RSF had committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.</p> <p>Some of the war\u2019s worst atrocities have been committed in Darfur, western Sudan. As many as 15,000 people were killed in the city of El Geneina in West Darfur last year by the RSF and allied Arab militias in violence targeted at the Masalit people. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the violence carried \u201chaunting echoes of the genocide that began almost 20 years ago\u201d.</p> <p>In June, pro-democracy activists said the RSF killed more than 100 people in an attack on a village in central Sudan.</p>    <h2>What is the current status of the war?</h2> <p>In recent weeks, the RSF has launched a full-scale attack on El Fasher, the only major population centre in Darfur it is yet to control. The attack follows a months-long siege. The city\u2019s last hospital was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/10/last-hospital-in-north-darfur-capital-sudan-closes-after-paramilitary-attack\">forced to close</a> after the paramilitary group stormed it in June. The RSF is also advancing in regions south of Khartoum.</p> <p>In the capital, which fell to the RSF early on in the war, the armed forces have gone on the offensive, pounding the centre and south of the city from the air this month.</p> <p>Several rounds of negotiation efforts have so far failed to end the fighting.</p> <h2>Why is Darfur at the centre of the conflict?</h2> <p>Home to about 9 million people, Darfur, the vast and largely arid swath of western and south-western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan\">Sudan</a>, has been at the centre of the conflict largely because it remains the stronghold of Hemedti. Many of the RSF\u2019s recruits are drawn from the region and from Hemedti\u2019s own Rizeigat tribe.</p> <p>For years, the RSF has terrorised communities in Darfur and much of the region is lawless: militias and other armed groups attack civilians with virtual impunity. In recent years, the RSF has invested significant resources in Darfur in an attempt to control its strategic assets, such as airstrips, mines, water sources and major roads. Analysts trace many of the roots of the latest conflict back to the appalling violence and human rights abuses in Darfur about 20 years ago. </p>",

      "bodyText": "How did the conflict begin? Fighting broke out in Khartoum, Sudan\u2019s capital, on 15 April 2023 as an escalating power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime finally turned deadly. On one side are the Sudanese armed forces who remain broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country\u2019s de facto ruler. Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militia who follow the former warlord Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. The RSF was founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia. Bashir wanted to crush a rebellion in the region of Darfur that began more than 20 years ago due to the political and economic marginalisation of the local population. Initially known as the Janjaweed, the RSF quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into a semi-organised paramilitary force and gave its leaders military ranks before deploying it to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur. Hemedti\u2019s power struggle with Burhan can be traced back to 2019 when the RSF and regular military forces cooperated to oust Bashir from power. When attempts to transition to a democratic civilian-led government faltered, many analysts felt an eventual showdown between Burhan and Hemedti was inevitable. What has been the human cost? The conflict has plunged Sudan into what the UN has described as \u201cone of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history\u201d. Tens of thousands have died, millions have been displaced, and hunger and disease are rife. According to the most recent figures, about 26 million people face severe food insecurity. Famine has been declared in the Zamzam displacement camp in Darfur. About 11.3 million people have been forced to flee the fighting, including nearly 2.95 million who have fled across the country\u2019s borders. Most have gone to Chad and South Sudan, where underfunded aid agencies say they are struggling to meet basic needs. A UN appeal for $1.51bn to support Sudanese refugees and their hosts in the region through the end of the year remains just 27% funded. In its latest humanitarian update, published on 1 October, the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said significant declines in vaccination rates and the destruction of health infrastructure resulting from the war mean Sudan is grappling with multiple disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, dengue fever, measles, and rubella. An estimated 3.4 million children under the age of five are at high risk of epidemic diseases, according to Unicef. The conflict has also robbed huge numbers of an education. More than 90% of the country\u2019s 19 million school-age children are unable to access formal education. Schools have been targeted in airstrikes, occupied by armed groups and used to store weapons. What atrocities are the warring sides accused of? The UN has accused the army and the RSF of carrying out indiscriminate attacks in residential areas, committing acts of sexual violence, arbitrarily detaining and torturing civilians and recruiting child soldiers. Both parties may have committed war crimes, a UN report in February said. They have denied the claims. The US went a step further last year, declaring that both had carried out war crimes and that the RSF had committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Some of the war\u2019s worst atrocities have been committed in Darfur, western Sudan. As many as 15,000 people were killed in the city of El Geneina in West Darfur last year by the RSF and allied Arab militias in violence targeted at the Masalit people. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the violence carried \u201chaunting echoes of the genocide that began almost 20 years ago\u201d. In June, pro-democracy activists said the RSF killed more than 100 people in an attack on a village in central Sudan. What is the current status of the war? In recent weeks, the RSF has launched a full-scale attack on El Fasher, the only major population centre in Darfur it is yet to control. The attack follows a months-long siege. The city\u2019s last hospital was forced to close after the paramilitary group stormed it in June. The RSF is also advancing in regions south of Khartoum. In the capital, which fell to the RSF early on in the war, the armed forces have gone on the offensive, pounding the centre and south of the city from the air this month. Several rounds of negotiation efforts have so far failed to end the fighting. Why is Darfur at the centre of the conflict? Home to about 9 million people, Darfur, the vast and largely arid swath of western and south-western Sudan, has been at the centre of the conflict largely because it remains the stronghold of Hemedti. Many of the RSF\u2019s recruits are drawn from the region and from Hemedti\u2019s own Rizeigat tribe. For years, the RSF has terrorised communities in Darfur and much of the region is lawless: militias and other armed groups attack civilians with virtual impunity. In recent years, the RSF has invested significant resources in Darfur in an attempt to control its strategic assets, such as airstrips, mines, water sources and major roads. Analysts trace many of the roots of the latest conflict back to the appalling violence and human rights abuses in Darfur about 20 years ago.",

And should anyone with hopes of becoming the new James Dean avoid starring as Captain America like a night out with Proxima Midnight? This ongoing debate first entered the cultural ether around the time that Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola were proclaiming loudly that all superhero movies were basically spawn of the corporate whore of Hollywood Babylon in 2019. The supposed problem was then crystallised intellectually by one Quentin Tarantino in 2022, who pointed out that most Marvel stars would be virtually unknown if they hadn\u2019t got the superhero gig. \u201cPart of the Marvel-ization of Hollywood is \u2026 you have all these actors who have become famous playing these characters,\u201d he told the 2 Bears, 1 Cave podcast while promoting Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. \u201cBut they\u2019re not movie stars. Right? Captain America is the star. Or Thor is the star ...

      "bodyText": "After they burned down his family home in northern Gaza, Israeli troops separated Ramez al-Skafi from his family and detained him. They had a particular job in mind for him, he said. For the next 11 days in early July, the 30-year-old Palestinian said he was sent into one house after another in his home district, Shuja\u2019iya, watched by his Israeli military minders. According to the account he gave the Guardian, they turned him into a human shield against booby-traps and Hamas gunmen. \u201cI tried to resist their proposal, but they started beating me and the officer told me it was not my choice to make and that I have to do whatever they want,\u201d Skafi said. \u201cHe told me that my work would be searching the houses and telling them information about the homeowners. After some extreme pressure, I was left no choice. \u201cThe next day I was told to go out on patrol with the Israeli soldiers, and I was very scared because of the tanks in front of me and the planes in the sky above me,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen [the minders] noticed my fear, they assured me: \u2018They know you are with us.\u2019\u201d Skafi was one of three Palestinians interviewed by the Guardian who said they had been used by units of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), sent far ahead of Israeli soldiers into unexplored houses and tunnels in Gaza. According to whistleblowers who spoke to the dissident veterans\u2019 group Breaking The Silence (BTS), the practice is widespread. The forcible use of Palestinian detainees to enter houses and tunnels in Gaza first came into public view in footage broadcast by Al Jazeera television in June and July. An investigation by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz in August gathered testimony from Israeli soldiers who said the Palestinians used as shields were known as \u201cshawish\u201d, a word of Turkish origin meaning \u201csergeant\u201d. The soldiers suggested that it was an institutionalised tactic approved by senior officers. \u201cIt\u2019s done with the knowledge of the brigade commander, at the least,\u201d a conscript in a combat unit said. The use of prisoners as human shields is a clear violation of the Geneva conventions and is expressly prohibited under Israeli law. The IDF has denied it employs the \u201cshawish\u201d tactic. \u201cThe orders and directives of the IDF prohibit the use of Gazan civilians captured in the field for military missions that endanger them. The protocols and orders have been clarified to the troops on the ground,\u201d the IDF said in a statement, adding that the reported claims had been \u201cforwarded to be examined by the relevant authorities\u201d. The testimony gathered by the Guardian from former Palestinian detainees is largely consistent with the reporting by Al Jazeera and Haaretz. On several occasions in the course of his detention, Skafi said he was made to hand-carry small quadcopter drones into the houses being searched so that the Israelis could see what was inside through the drones\u2019 built-in cameras. \u201cAfter I had finished filming the houses from the inside and left, they entered and they started destroying it,\u201d Skafi said. \u201cEvery day, after they\u2019d finished with me, they used to tie my hands and cover my eyes. They only took the chains off when they were giving me food or when I was allowed to go to the bathroom.\u201d Skafi said that on the sixth day of being used to clear houses in Shuja\u2019iya, his IDF captors came under fire from a Hamas gunman, leading to a gunfight and a standoff that lasted from noon until that evening. \u201cDuring that period they used me as a human shield. I was in the middle. They said to the resistance fighter: \u201cGive yourself up, or we\u2019ll kill this civilian,\u201d Skafi alleged. The IDF eventually succeeded in killing the lone Hamas fighter, he said, and forced Skafi to enter the house the militant had been using as a sniper position and photograph the body with a mobile phone. Skafi said the IDF unit using him was furious with him because the sniper position was in a house he had been sent to check earlier in the day, and Skafi was accused of helping conceal the gunman\u2019s presence. Skafi swore the man had not been there when he had searched the house, but he said his protestations did not spare him from prolonged beatings, which continued until the unit\u2019s senior officer came to him after four days of interrogation with a plate of rice, and told Skafi his account had indeed been found to be true. The same officer also told him the unit\u2019s operations in Shuja\u2019iya were wrapping up and Skafi would no longer be needed. On his 11th day in detention, his shackles were removed, and he was given a bag containing food and water and told to go home. Skafi complained to the soldiers that he was too exhausted to carry a heavy package but they said the bag would identify him as someone who had worked with the IDF so he would not be targeted by Israeli fire as he made his way back across Shuja\u2019iya to his family. The accounts provided by Skafi and other former Palestinian detainees in Gaza generally confirm the accounts given by Israeli soldiers to other media and activist groups. In one recent incident, the details of which were given to the Guardian by friends of the Israeli involved, a Palestinian \u201cshawish\u201d grabbed hold of an IDF soldier\u2019s gun and in the ensuing struggle shot the soldier in the foot, before the Palestinian was killed by other soldiers in the unit. Whistleblower testimony given to the Israeli dissident group BTS suggests the use of human shields is rife. \u201cWe had a guy who spoke Arabic in the company, and \u2026 he sent them [Palestinian detainees] to open up the houses so that if there was a bomb, they [the Palestinians] would be the ones to get blown up,\u201d one IDF soldier whistleblower told BTS, saying that one of the human shields used was a Palestinian teenager. Nadav Weiman, a former IDF sniper and now BTS director, said: \u201cFrom what we understand it was a very widely used protocol, meaning there are hundreds of Palestinians in Gaza who have been used as human shields. \u201cPalestinians are being grabbed from humanitarian corridors inside Gaza \u2026 and then they\u2019re being brought to different units inside Gaza \u2013 regular infantry units, not special forces.\u201d Weiman said. \u201cAnd then those Palestinians are being used as human shields to sweep tunnels and also houses. In some cases, they have a GoPro camera on their chest or on their head and in almost all of the cases, they are cuffed before they are taken into a tunnel or house to sweep and they are dressed in IDF uniform.\u201d Being dressed in an Israeli uniform would be a source of particular shame for Palestinian detainees, and the three interviewed by the Guardian all said they had successfully resisted pressure to wear IDF combat fatigues. But they claimed they were deliberately put in harm\u2019s way to protect soldiers. \u201cThey took us to missions with them, sending me to the houses in front of them to make sure of their safety, and then they would enter behind us, and after they left, they used to blow up the house behind them,\u201d said Ismail al-Sawalhi, a 30-year-old blacksmith and farmer from Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza. Sawalhi was detained near the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south in July and made to work as a human shield for an IDF unit for 12 days of clearing operations in Rafah. \u201cThe soldiers protected themselves with us all the time so that they would not be attacked by the resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were like toys in their hands.\u201d A 35-year-old from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, who identified himself only as Abu Said for fear of reprisals but whose identity was verified by the Guardian, said he was detained in February and used as a human shield over a period of four hours. \u201cThe Israeli soldiers put a GPS tracker on my hand and told me: \u2018If you try to run away, we will shoot you.

The use of prisoners as human shields is prohibited under article 28 of the fourth Geneva conventions, which states: \u201cThe presence of a protected person [for example a prisoner] may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.\u201d In 2002, Israel\u2019s high court issued an injunction prohibiting the IDF from using what was known as the \u201cneighbour procedure\u201d, detaining a Palestinian in an area of unrest and ordering the detainee to knock on the doors of their neighbours and oversee the clearance of their houses.

      "body": "<p>Key rightwing legal groups with ties to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and his allies have banked millions of dollars from conservative foundations and filed multiple lawsuits challenging voting rules in swing states that are already sowing distrust of election processes and pushing dangerous conspiracy theories, election watchdogs warn.</p> <p>They also warn that the groups appear to be laying the groundwork for a concerted challenge to the result of November\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">presidential election</a> if Trump is defeated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>.</p> <p>America First Legal and the Public Interest Legal Foundation together reaped more than $30m dollars from the Wisconsin-based Bradley Impact Fund and its parent, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, from 2017 through 2022, according to a financial analysis from the Center for Media and Democracy.</p> <p>Lawsuits filed by the groups, which overlap with some Republican party litigation, focus in part on conspiratorial charges of non-citizen voting, which is exceedingly rare, and bloated voter rolls, and presage more lawsuits by Trump if his presidential run fails, in an echo of his 2020 election-denialist claims, say watchdogs.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems clear that the lawsuits these rightwing groups are bringing attacking the integrity of the voting rolls, methods of voting and how the ballots are counted are an attempt to make it harder for people to vote, disenfranchise and intimidate legitimate voters, and create confusion,\u201d said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission.</p> <p>Noble added: \u201cAt the same time, they also appear to be laying the groundwork to challenge the results of the election after November 5, if Trump loses.\u201d</p> <p>In another troubling sign, Noble cited the dearth of data to support non-citizen voting claims to reject the \u201crationale for the non-citizen voting lawsuits\u201d.</p> <p>A study from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, in the wake of false claims by Trump of widespread non-citizen voting in the 2016 presidential election, revealed only 30 incidents among 23.5m ballots cast.</p> <p>Other voting watchdogs voice strong warnings about the Maga-allied legal blitzes.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing much more litigation from Trump allies this election cycle, targeted at swing states, which appears to lack evidence,\u201d warned David Becker, who runs the nonpartisan non-profit Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research.</p> <p>Becker noted, critically, that the lawsuit plaintiffs often knew about the challenged policies, including issues relating to voting lists, non-citizen voting, mail voting and military voting, years or even decades earlier, and seem to have intentionally waited until the last minute to file their lawsuits. \u201cWhile they\u2019re very unlikely to get the relief they\u2019re seeking, this could later fuel claims that the election was stolen,\u201d he said.</p>    <p>Becker\u2019s points are underscored by the litigation blitzes from Maga allies in swing states.</p> <p>The surge in litigation is exemplified in Michigan, where the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) filed a lawsuit alleging voter rolls are bloated with the names of deceased people and seeking to clean them up \u2013 moves that mirror others this year by rightwing groups and the Republican party.</p> <p>PILF\u2019s Michigan lawsuit was rejected on 1 March by a federal judge who ruled the state is \u201cconsistently among the most active states in the United States in canceling the registrations of deceased individuals\u201d and that \u201cdeceased voters are removed from Michigan\u2019s voter rolls on a regular and ongoing basis\u201d.</p> <p>PILF, which has filed similar lawsuits in several other states, received about $3m from the two Bradley foundations in the years 2017-2022. It is chaired by ex-Trump lawyer Cleta Mitchell, a board member of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Mitchell was on Trump\u2019s infamous call on 2 January 2021 with Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, where he beseeched him to \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 votes to help reverse his defeat there.</p> <p>Later in 2021, Mitchell organized a major Maga-allied project dubbed the \u201celection-integrity network\u201d, which promoted voting conspiracies and election-denialist claims about 2020, and has remained a key figure in the right\u2019s legal efforts this year.</p> <p>Soon after Pilf\u2019s lawsuit was dismissed, the Republican National Committee filed a similar suit in Michigan that Jocelyn Benson, the secretary of state there, denounced as a \u201cPR campaign masquerading as a meritless lawsuit\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Arizona, America First Legal, which is run by Trump\u2019s hard-right ex-immigration adviser Stephen Miller, has sued to compel counties to probe some 44,000 voters who were registered without providing proof of citizenship.</p> <p>The legal battle was sparked in part by Arizona\u2019s two-level voter-registration system that mandates voters must show proof of citizenship in state elections, but doesn\u2019t require that in federal contests.</p> <p>Chuck Coughlin, a veteran Arizona Republican consultant, who became an independent in 2017, said that \u201cthe lawsuit is driven by falsehoods about non-citizen voting and is part and parcel of the Trump narrative to depress voter turnout through negative campaigning and suppress younger voter participation in the cycle\u201d.</p> <p>The Miller-led group\u2019s legal blitzes have been fueled by hefty checks from rightwing donors, including a whopping $27m dollars it received in 2022 from the Bradley Impact Fund.</p> <p>Voting experts don\u2019t see much merit to the group\u2019s lawsuits and many others filed by Trump-allied groups.</p> <p>\u201cMany of these suits seem like vehicles to spread conspiracy theories and misinformation,\u201d said Leah Tulin, a senior litigation counsel with the Brennan Center. \u201cIn other words, they read more as press releases than serious legal claims.\u201d</p> <p>By way of example, Tulin cited several lawsuits filed by America First Policy Institute (AFPI), which boasts billionaire Linda McMahon, a former Trump cabinet official and a co-chair of his current transition team, as a board member.</p> <p>AFPI has filed lawsuits in Georgia and Arizona, including one intended to allow local election officials to block certifying results when they suspect fraud.

      "bodyText": "Key rightwing legal groups with ties to Donald Trump and his allies have banked millions of dollars from conservative foundations and filed multiple lawsuits challenging voting rules in swing states that are already sowing distrust of election processes and pushing dangerous conspiracy theories, election watchdogs warn. They also warn that the groups appear to be laying the groundwork for a concerted challenge to the result of November\u2019s presidential election if Trump is defeated by Kamala Harris. America First Legal and the Public Interest Legal Foundation together reaped more than $30m dollars from the Wisconsin-based Bradley Impact Fund and its parent, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, from 2017 through 2022, according to a financial analysis from the Center for Media and Democracy. Lawsuits filed by the groups, which overlap with some Republican party litigation, focus in part on conspiratorial charges of non-citizen voting, which is exceedingly rare, and bloated voter rolls, and presage more lawsuits by Trump if his presidential run fails, in an echo of his 2020 election-denialist claims, say watchdogs. \u201cIt seems clear that the lawsuits these rightwing groups are bringing attacking the integrity of the voting rolls, methods of voting and how the ballots are counted are an attempt to make it harder for people to vote, disenfranchise and intimidate legitimate voters, and create confusion,\u201d said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission. Noble added: \u201cAt the same time, they also appear to be laying the groundwork to challenge the results of the election after November 5, if Trump loses.\u201d In another troubling sign, Noble cited the dearth of data to support non-citizen voting claims to reject the \u201crationale for the non-citizen voting lawsuits\u201d. A study from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, in the wake of false claims by Trump of widespread non-citizen voting in the 2016 presidential election, revealed only 30 incidents among 23.5m ballots cast. Other voting watchdogs voice strong warnings about the Maga-allied legal blitzes. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing much more litigation from Trump allies this election cycle, targeted at swing states, which appears to lack evidence,\u201d warned David Becker, who runs the nonpartisan non-profit Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research. Becker noted, critically, that the lawsuit plaintiffs often knew about the challenged policies, including issues relating to voting lists, non-citizen voting, mail voting and military voting, years or even decades earlier, and seem to have intentionally waited until the last minute to file their lawsuits. \u201cWhile they\u2019re very unlikely to get the relief they\u2019re seeking, this could later fuel claims that the election was stolen,\u201d he said. Becker\u2019s points are underscored by the litigation blitzes from Maga allies in swing states. The surge in litigation is exemplified in Michigan, where the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) filed a lawsuit alleging voter rolls are bloated with the names of deceased people and seeking to clean them up \u2013 moves that mirror others this year by rightwing groups and the Republican party. PILF\u2019s Michigan lawsuit was rejected on 1 March by a federal judge who ruled the state is \u201cconsistently among the most active states in the United States in canceling the registrations of deceased individuals\u201d and that \u201cdeceased voters are removed from Michigan\u2019s voter rolls on a regular and ongoing basis\u201d. PILF, which has filed similar lawsuits in several other states, received about $3m from the two Bradley foundations in the years 2017-2022. It is chaired by ex-Trump lawyer Cleta Mitchell, a board member of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Mitchell was on Trump\u2019s infamous call on 2 January 2021 with Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, where he beseeched him to \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 votes to help reverse his defeat there. Later in 2021, Mitchell organized a major Maga-allied project dubbed the \u201celection-integrity network\u201d, which promoted voting conspiracies and election-denialist claims about 2020, and has remained a key figure in the right\u2019s legal efforts this year. Soon after Pilf\u2019s lawsuit was dismissed, the Republican National Committee filed a similar suit in Michigan that Jocelyn Benson, the secretary of state there, denounced as a \u201cPR campaign masquerading as a meritless lawsuit\u201d. Meanwhile, in Arizona, America First Legal, which is run by Trump\u2019s hard-right ex-immigration adviser Stephen Miller, has sued to compel counties to probe some 44,000 voters who were registered without providing proof of citizenship. The legal battle was sparked in part by Arizona\u2019s two-level voter-registration system that mandates voters must show proof of citizenship in state elections, but doesn\u2019t require that in federal contests. Chuck Coughlin, a veteran Arizona Republican consultant, who became an independent in 2017, said that \u201cthe lawsuit is driven by falsehoods about non-citizen voting and is part and parcel of the Trump narrative to depress voter turnout through negative campaigning and suppress younger voter participation in the cycle\u201d. The Miller-led group\u2019s legal blitzes have been fueled by hefty checks from rightwing donors, including a whopping $27m dollars it received in 2022 from the Bradley Impact Fund. Voting experts don\u2019t see much merit to the group\u2019s lawsuits and many others filed by Trump-allied groups. \u201cMany of these suits seem like vehicles to spread conspiracy theories and misinformation,\u201d said Leah Tulin, a senior litigation counsel with the Brennan Center. \u201cIn other words, they read more as press releases than serious legal claims.\u201d By way of example, Tulin cited several lawsuits filed by America First Policy Institute (AFPI), which boasts billionaire Linda McMahon, a former Trump cabinet official and a co-chair of his current transition team, as a board member. AFPI has filed lawsuits in Georgia and Arizona, including one intended to allow local election officials to block certifying results when they suspect fraud. In Georgia, a Fulton county judge this month rejected AFPI\u2019s Georgia lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of a county election official who has been allied with Mitchell\u2019s election-integrity network. AFPI also filed a lawsuit this year in Texas that alleged that a Biden initiative in 2021 that greenlighted government agencies to promote voter registration was just a partisan move that would likely help Democrats. Ken Blackwell, the former Ohio secretary of state who chairs AFPI\u2019s Center for Election Integrity, charged on X in August that the Biden administration was mounting an \u201cattempt to weaponize federal agencies into a leftwing election operation that opens the doors to non-citizen voting\u201d. On another Maga-allied election front, Arizona-based Restoration of America donated $3.1m dollars and $5.9m dollars, respectively, in 2021 and 2022, to Tea Party Patriots Action and Susan B Anthony List. Both groups have been active with the Only Citizens Vote Coalition, according to Issue One, a bipartisan political reform group. Restoration of America boasts Gina Swoboda, who chairs the state GOP, as a top official; Swoboda also has been an ally and a podcast guest of Cleta Mitchell, who has helped lead the Only Citizens Vote Coalition. The coalition this year helped push a bill through the House requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, even though non-citizen voting is almost nil and is illegal. Election watchdogs say the aim of these pro-Trump groups with election-denialist track records, coupled with the surge in lawsuits by other Maga allies, is to cast doubts about election rules and security, and are harbingers for challenging the results in key states if Trump loses. \u201cUnder the guise of election integrity, new policies and legal challenges are being advanced that could ultimately disenfranchise US citizens,\u201d said Michael Beckel, the research director of Issue One. \u201cSecretive big-money donors are bankrolling a blitz of false information about the integrity of elections and laying the groundwork for Trump supporters to challenge the results of the presidential election if they don\u2019t like the outcome,\u201d Beckel added.

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war\">war in Gaza</a> is not high among most voters\u2019 concerns. But for many Arab Americans and protesters of the war, it is. As election day nears and the margins tighten \u2013 and with the critical swing state of Michigan, home to the largest Arab American community in the nation, up for grabs \u2013 these people are among the small, scattered constituencies that could determine the results. This makes their political strategies crucial to the US\u2019s \u2013 and, by extension, Palestine\u2019s \u2013 future.</p> <p>Some activists working to end the genocide are putting that urgent cause ahead of the other urgent cause: electing a Democrat, if only to prevent a Trump presidency. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be a one-issue voter and that issue is genocide, I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d a Dearborn, Michigan, woman <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/1210938241/dearborn-michigan-arab-american-voters\">told</a> NPR\u2019s Code Switch.</p> <p>For these people, Harris\u2019s repeated assertions that \u201cfar too many innocent Palestinians have been killed\u201d \u2013 spoken in the passive voice and always accompanied by even louder assertions of commitment to Israel\u2019s \u201cself-defense\u201d \u2013 no longer cut it. A progressive activist who is stumping for Trump in Michigan said there\u2019s nothing the Democrat can do to change her mind. The administration\u2019s collaboration in genocide is unforgivable; she wants the party punished. Her eyes are on the 2028 election, she said \u2013 apparently sanguine that there will be an election after the ascension of King Donald the First.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2024/10/inside-the-uncommitted-movements-failure-to-move-the-democratic-party-on-the-gaza-genocide/\">Mondoweiss</a> this month, journalist and activist Saleema Gul interviewed a dozen members of the Uncommitted movement in a post-mortem of its campaign and failure to secure a speaking slot at the DNC this summer. The movement persuaded three-quarters of a million Democratic primary voters to write in \u201cuncommitted\u201d or leave their ballots blank to signal that their support for Biden, now Harris, depends on a pledge to end unconditional military support to Israel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/17/netanyahu-weapons-biden\">Netanyahu crosses every red-line and yet is rewarded with more weapons. Why? | Mohamad Bazzi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of the people interviewed in the piece felt that the movement should have tried to influence the party platform in the primary process and quit there. Others believed that pushing for a speaker at the DNC distracted from organizing anti-war delegates inside the convention. After much debate, the leadership decided to endorse no one. Instead, it is urging supporters to \u201cregister anti-Trump votes\u201d and not vote for a third-party presidential candidate. That move, wrote Gul, \u201chas led many to believe the Uncommitted movement has prioritized shielding the Democratic Party over forcefully pushing for an end to the Gaza genocide\u201d.</p> <p>The debate within the uncommitted movement encapsulates the perennial tensions in all political organizing: radical change v incremental reform; grassroots activism v establishment engagement; insider work v outsider disruption; movement-building v election-cycle campaigns. But to put \u201cversus\u201d between any of the above is to misunderstand political strategy: that is, to presume<strong> </strong>that organizing is either/or.</p> <p>In fact, you can do more than one thing at a time: organize for an arms embargo; get Harris elected; move the Democrats leftward; and build a radical pro-liberation movement.</p> <p>That these tactics don\u2019t always overlap does not mean they contradict each other. Grassroots movements move politicians, not the other way around. But grassroots movements labor for decades far from the centers of influence before policy makers code their ideas and demands \u2013 watered down, of course \u2013 into bills and statutes. The more local the politician, the more open their ears are to those demands.</p> <p>For instance, in New York City\u2019s safely Democratic congressional districts nine and 10, antiwar groups are asking voters to write in the name of Hind Rajab, a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli tank, instead of voting for the pro-Israel Democrats or any of the other parties\u2019 candidates. The activists want to remind the Dems that their antiwar constituents are watching, without jeopardizing the party\u2019s chances of winning back the House of Representatives.

      "bodyText": "The war in Gaza is not high among most voters\u2019 concerns. But for many Arab Americans and protesters of the war, it is. As election day nears and the margins tighten \u2013 and with the critical swing state of Michigan, home to the largest Arab American community in the nation, up for grabs \u2013 these people are among the small, scattered constituencies that could determine the results. This makes their political strategies crucial to the US\u2019s \u2013 and, by extension, Palestine\u2019s \u2013 future. Some activists working to end the genocide are putting that urgent cause ahead of the other urgent cause: electing a Democrat, if only to prevent a Trump presidency. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be a one-issue voter and that issue is genocide, I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d a Dearborn, Michigan, woman told NPR\u2019s Code Switch. For these people, Harris\u2019s repeated assertions that \u201cfar too many innocent Palestinians have been killed\u201d \u2013 spoken in the passive voice and always accompanied by even louder assertions of commitment to Israel\u2019s \u201cself-defense\u201d \u2013 no longer cut it. A progressive activist who is stumping for Trump in Michigan said there\u2019s nothing the Democrat can do to change her mind. The administration\u2019s collaboration in genocide is unforgivable; she wants the party punished. Her eyes are on the 2028 election, she said \u2013 apparently sanguine that there will be an election after the ascension of King Donald the First. In Mondoweiss this month, journalist and activist Saleema Gul interviewed a dozen members of the Uncommitted movement in a post-mortem of its campaign and failure to secure a speaking slot at the DNC this summer. The movement persuaded three-quarters of a million Democratic primary voters to write in \u201cuncommitted\u201d or leave their ballots blank to signal that their support for Biden, now Harris, depends on a pledge to end unconditional military support to Israel. Some of the people interviewed in the piece felt that the movement should have tried to influence the party platform in the primary process and quit there. Others believed that pushing for a speaker at the DNC distracted from organizing anti-war delegates inside the convention. After much debate, the leadership decided to endorse no one. Instead, it is urging supporters to \u201cregister anti-Trump votes\u201d and not vote for a third-party presidential candidate. That move, wrote Gul, \u201chas led many to believe the Uncommitted movement has prioritized shielding the Democratic Party over forcefully pushing for an end to the Gaza genocide\u201d. The debate within the uncommitted movement encapsulates the perennial tensions in all political organizing: radical change v incremental reform; grassroots activism v establishment engagement; insider work v outsider disruption; movement-building v election-cycle campaigns. But to put \u201cversus\u201d between any of the above is to misunderstand political strategy: that is, to presume that organizing is either/or. In fact, you can do more than one thing at a time: organize for an arms embargo; get Harris elected; move the Democrats leftward; and build a radical pro-liberation movement. That these tactics don\u2019t always overlap does not mean they contradict each other. Grassroots movements move politicians, not the other way around. But grassroots movements labor for decades far from the centers of influence before policy makers code their ideas and demands \u2013 watered down, of course \u2013 into bills and statutes. The more local the politician, the more open their ears are to those demands. For instance, in New York City\u2019s safely Democratic congressional districts nine and 10, antiwar groups are asking voters to write in the name of Hind Rajab, a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli tank, instead of voting for the pro-Israel Democrats or any of the other parties\u2019 candidates. The activists want to remind the Dems that their antiwar constituents are watching, without jeopardizing the party\u2019s chances of winning back the House of Representatives. But presidential candidates are as far from the ground as candidates get \u2013 and this year a no vote for the Democrat holds potentially catastrophic consequences. You could argue that electing a woman of color as president would be a radical step forward for the US. But Harris is no radical. In fact, presidential elections rarely lead to radical change. The big difference this time is that Trump\u2019s election would. The anti-war movement should not cease to pressure the Harris campaign to win their votes. Her supporters should not cease persuading anti-war voters to vote for her. Right now, a door is opening for both to happen. Harris herself pushed the door ajar. In her interview with Fox News last week, she suggested for the first time that she might break with the Biden administration. \u201cLet me be very clear,\u201d she said. \u201cMy presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.\u201d She pledged to bring \u201cfresh new ideas\u201d to the Oval Office. One idea \u2013 not so fresh, but good anyway \u2013 would be to call for the US simply to abide by its own law: the Leahy Law, enacted in 1997, requires the state department to vet military forces receiving US aid for violations of international human rights law. If there\u2019s credible evidence of such violations, the aid must be withheld. Since 2000, former US senator Patrick Leahy has been pressing the state department to apply such scrutiny to Israel, which has remained practically exempt. In May, in the Washington Post, he reasserted the necessity of doing so now, citing violations in Gaza and the West Bank.

      "body": "<p>Psychodynamic psychotherapists do not give their patients advice, and although this is a column and not a psychotherapy session, I do try to stick to this when writing about how to build a better life. However, I am now breaking that rule. I advise you never to read anything by ChatGPT, ever. Or, as ChatGPT might put it, having taken all factors into consideration in the process of reaching the aforementioned conclusion, it could be beneficial to note the following if you find yourself in the position of wishing for your life to be different in a positive way from how it currently is: Never. Read. Anything. Written. By. ChatGPT. Ever. And don\u2019t @me.</p> <p>This kind of wordy \u201cslop\u201d with its multiple mind-numbing clauses often features in the text produced by AI chatbots. It\u2019s what I call the thickening agent: something added to the text that brings no meaning \u2013 no flavour or nutrition; that takes up page/brain space and makes it more difficult to understand, not easier. The text seems to be saying something and then, suddenly, it isn\u2019t. In journalism school I learned to KISS \u2013 Keep It Simple, Stupid. AI chatbots do not appear to have been taught the same.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s bad writing. I knew as soon as I read my first unnecessarily long Chat GPT-created sentence that I had experienced this thickening agent somewhere before.</p> <p>I\u2019ve felt it in the consulting room \u2013 the one in which I see my psychoanalyst, and the one in which I see my patients. This thickening agent is a part of our own minds. It is the bit of us that seeks to muddle instead of to clarify, and that would rather keep things cloudy and confusing than direct and meaningful. It\u2019s the bit that keeps us stuck, and not living a better life.</p> <p>Let me try to describe what it feels like in a session. I might sense that a patient is really getting somewhere: that they are making their way towards some very painful emotional truth, linking, for example, a devastating loss from their childhood with a relationship pattern they keep unconsciously repeating today, and which desperately needs to be understood so they can choose a different response. My patient is associating memories and feelings and dreams, and this understanding is within sniffing distance \u2013 and then suddenly out comes the thickening agent. The sniff of possibility is gone; the tone becomes knowing instead of exploratory, cognitive instead of emotional, intellectualised instead of intimate. The compass of the session turns from pointing towards understanding to pointing towards obfuscation.</p> <p>The psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion devised a way of mapping analytic sessions according to these compass points, among others. He determined that a patient and/or analyst might be \u201cin K\u201d or \u201cin -K\u201d (minus K) at any point in a session: that is, to my understanding, at a point where they can bear a certain kind of knowledge about themselves (\u201cin K\u201d), or in a state where they cannot (\u201cin -K\u201d). What I am saying is that ChatGPT operates very much in \u201c-K\u201d; I can smell it from a mile away.</p> <p>And, as regular readers may by now suspect, the reason this irritates me so much is that I cannot bear my own capacity for getting stuck in -K.

      "bodyText": "Psychodynamic psychotherapists do not give their patients advice, and although this is a column and not a psychotherapy session, I do try to stick to this when writing about how to build a better life. However, I am now breaking that rule. I advise you never to read anything by ChatGPT, ever. Or, as ChatGPT might put it, having taken all factors into consideration in the process of reaching the aforementioned conclusion, it could be beneficial to note the following if you find yourself in the position of wishing for your life to be different in a positive way from how it currently is: Never. Read. Anything. Written. By. ChatGPT. Ever. And don\u2019t @me. This kind of wordy \u201cslop\u201d with its multiple mind-numbing clauses often features in the text produced by AI chatbots. It\u2019s what I call the thickening agent: something added to the text that brings no meaning \u2013 no flavour or nutrition; that takes up page/brain space and makes it more difficult to understand, not easier. The text seems to be saying something and then, suddenly, it isn\u2019t. In journalism school I learned to KISS \u2013 Keep It Simple, Stupid. AI chatbots do not appear to have been taught the same. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s bad writing. I knew as soon as I read my first unnecessarily long Chat GPT-created sentence that I had experienced this thickening agent somewhere before. I\u2019ve felt it in the consulting room \u2013 the one in which I see my psychoanalyst, and the one in which I see my patients. This thickening agent is a part of our own minds. It is the bit of us that seeks to muddle instead of to clarify, and that would rather keep things cloudy and confusing than direct and meaningful. It\u2019s the bit that keeps us stuck, and not living a better life. Let me try to describe what it feels like in a session. I might sense that a patient is really getting somewhere: that they are making their way towards some very painful emotional truth, linking, for example, a devastating loss from their childhood with a relationship pattern they keep unconsciously repeating today, and which desperately needs to be understood so they can choose a different response. My patient is associating memories and feelings and dreams, and this understanding is within sniffing distance \u2013 and then suddenly out comes the thickening agent. The sniff of possibility is gone; the tone becomes knowing instead of exploratory, cognitive instead of emotional, intellectualised instead of intimate. The compass of the session turns from pointing towards understanding to pointing towards obfuscation. The psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion devised a way of mapping analytic sessions according to these compass points, among others. He determined that a patient and/or analyst might be \u201cin K\u201d or \u201cin -K\u201d (minus K) at any point in a session: that is, to my understanding, at a point where they can bear a certain kind of knowledge about themselves (\u201cin K\u201d), or in a state where they cannot (\u201cin -K\u201d). What I am saying is that ChatGPT operates very much in \u201c-K\u201d; I can smell it from a mile away. And, as regular readers may by now suspect, the reason this irritates me so much is that I cannot bear my own capacity for getting stuck in -K. I have been a patient in many sessions like the one I described. As much as I understand this is a part of being human, that does not take away the frustration of feeling the minutes of my session tick by while I remain trapped in the -K web I have woven from my own words. It is not a coincidence that the slop of these AI chatbots reads like stodgy unseasoned potato soup. Because, as a friend recently explained to me, these chatbots learn to write from what they are fed: that is, writing by humans. The design is inspired by neural networks in human brains.

It turned out to be a productive collision: new knowledge meeting the empirical knowledge of a Sicilian pastry laboratory, and Corrado\u2019s imaginative, wishful thinking. Like many people, we have visited his <a href=\"https://www.caffeitalia.se/journal/caff%C3%A8-sicilia-a-noto\">Caff\u00e8 Sicilia</a> and eaten almond granita and almond-and-sesame biscuits filled with bitter marmalade, and enjoyed bergamot cream, liquorice and wild fennel tea, as well as a ricotta-filled tube of cannoli decorated with a curl of candied orange.</p> <p>I also had the chance to watch Corrado cook at a demonstration about citrus and honey at the <a href=\"https://annatascalanza.com/\">Anna Tasca Lanza cooking school</a>.

It turned out to be a productive collision: new knowledge meeting the empirical knowledge of a Sicilian pastry laboratory, and Corrado\u2019s imaginative, wishful thinking. Like many people, we have visited his Caff\u00e8 Sicilia and eaten almond granita and almond-and-sesame biscuits filled with bitter marmalade, and enjoyed bergamot cream, liquorice and wild fennel tea, as well as a ricotta-filled tube of cannoli decorated with a curl of candied orange. I also had the chance to watch Corrado cook at a demonstration about citrus and honey at the Anna Tasca Lanza cooking school. He infused cream with bitter orange and mandarin to serve with almond cake; made pasta with anchovy and lemon, and topped it with breadcrumbs; braised artichokes with wild herbs; grilled sausage polpette between lemon leaves. But what I remember most was his rolling of a round egg frittata into u pisci d\u2019ovu, or a \u201cfish made of egg\u201d.

But for one town in this state that saw its water become mud-brown, undrinkable and even flammable 15 years ago, the specter of fracking never went away.</p> <p>Residents in Dimock, a rural town of around 1,200 people in north-east Pennsylvania, have been locked in a lengthy battle to remediate their water supply that was ruined in 2009 after the drilling of dozens of wells to access a hotspot called the \u201cSaudi Arabia of gas\u201d found deep underneath their homes.</p> <p>The company behind the drilling, Texas-based Coterra, was barred from the area for years for its role in poisoning the private water wells Dimock relies upon and, in a landmark later move in 2020, was charged with multiple crimes. But it has now been ushered back into the area following a deal struck by the state\u2019s Democratic leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/11/fracking-debate-explained-debate\">Fracking explained: why the fossil fuel extraction process became a US election issue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The re-starting of drilling around Dimock late last year comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> clamor to cast themselves to Pennsylvania voters as supporters of fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected deep underground to extract embedded oil and gas.</p> <p>\u201cIf she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one,\u201d Trump said of Harris, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/30/kamala-harris-fracking\">who previously supported a ban</a>, during the duo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/sep/11/harris-v-trump-highlights-of-the-presidential-debate-video\">televised debate last month</a>. The former US president has run a <a href=\"https://x.com/AdImpact_Pol/status/1834260862313382038\">barrage of ads</a> in the state accusing Harris of wanting to shut down the fracking industry. But during the same debate, Harris insisted \u201cI will not ban fracking\u201d, with the vice-president boasting of new fracking leases granted during Joe Biden\u2019s administration.</p> <p>This bipartisan embrace of fracking has stirred fury among residents of Dimock whose well water is still riddled by toxins linked to an array of health problems and, most spectacularly, contains so much flammable methane that people have passed out in the shower, wells exploded, and water running from the tap could be set on fire by match, according to official reports and accounts from locals.</p>    <p>\u201cSure as hell, I\u2019m not voting for either of those two assholes,\u201d said Ray Kemble, a bearded military veteran and former trucker, as he puffed on a cigar in his home. Reams of documents and photos chronicling the long fight against fracking lay on the table next to Kemble, along with a bottle of his murky tap water, three Sherlock Holmes-style smoking pipes and a briefcase filled with handguns.</p> <p>Shortly after a gas well was drilled a few hundred feet from Kemble\u2019s home, he said his drinking water turned from dark brown to green and finally jet black, with the liquid smelling like he had taken \u201cevery household chemical you can think of, dump it into a blender, take two asses of a skunk and put that in there, put it on puree, dump it out, and take a whiff\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe water is still not fixed,\u201d said Kemble, who blames the loss of most of his teeth to the presence of uranium, along with other contaminants such as copper and arsenic, in his water.</p> <p>\u201cWhen a politicians\u2019 lips are moving they are lying,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fricking nightmare. We are back to square one from before the moratorium came into effect \u2013 there\u2019s massive drilling like crazy. I don\u2019t care who you are, rich, poor, or whatever, without water and clean air and clean soil, we\u2019re all freaking dead.\u201d</p> <p>Kemble, a Republican who has printed cards featuring the Gadsen flag snake coiled around a gas well, has found unlikely allies in this saga, with figures such as <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/yoko-ono-and-sean-lennon-lead-a-tour-through-fracking-country-11652/\">Yoko Ono</a> and <a href=\"https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2011/12/09/reporters-notebook-unfriendly-bars-and-the-incredible-hulk-comes-to-dimock/\">Mark Ruffalo</a> voicing concern for Dimock\u2019s plight. His neighbor Victoria Switzer, a former school teacher turned artist whose paintings adorn a soaring timber-framed home beside a bucolic creek, is a rare liberal in this <a href=\"https://www.susqco.com/getmedia/56f16623-fdfd-46c3-844e-7b6e2a07cf38/2020-General-Unofficial-Summary-Report.pdf\">staunchly conservative county</a> but also shares Kemble\u2019s frustration.</p>    <p>\u201cI like Kamala, but I was unhappy when she said she wouldn\u2019t ban fracking,\u201d said Switzer, who said her water bubbled \u201clike Alka-Seltzer\u201d after the drilling started. Like Kemble, she now gets bottled water deliveries each week from Coterra.</p> <p>\u201cBut then the other guy [Trump] just says, \u2018We\u2019ll drill more, we\u2019ll get rid of the regulations\u2019 \u2013 so that should scare us. People are held hostage by the fossil-fuel industry here.\u201d</p> <p>Although 1.5 million people across Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://www.fractracker.org/2023/08/pennsylvania-health-study-results/\">live</a> within half a mile of oil and gas wells, compressors and processors, not all feel as sharply affected by fracking and to win the state\u2019s crucial 19 electoral votes, according to prevailing political thinking, means not threatening an industry that <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/fracking-pennsylvania-shale-gas-workforce-health-environmental-damage/\">directly employs</a> around 16,000 people, around 0.5% of all jobs in the state.</p> <p>\u201cFracking has become a big part of the election but there really isn\u2019t much opposition to it now, it\u2019s become part of life in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Jeff Brauer, a political scientist at Pennsylvania\u2019s Keystone College. \u201cA fracking ban would be very unpopular and Kamala Harris knows she can\u2019t be against fracking if she\u2019s going to win here. She had to clean that up.\u201d</p>    <p>But how popular is fracking? Polling shows a complicated picture rather than overwhelming support, with <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020/08/10/pennsylvania-fracking-poll\">two</a> <a href=\"https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/public-opinion-is-moving-against-natural-gas-and-fracking/\">2020</a> surveys showing slightly more Pennsylvania voters want to ban fracking than keep it, while a <a href=\"https://www.muhlenberg.edu/aboutus/polling/climateenvironmentsurveys/august2024-publicopiniononfrackinginpa/\">separate 2022 poll found the reverse</a>. Unusually, Pennsylvania\u2019s constitution <a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=00&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=1&amp;sctn=27&amp;subsctn=0\">enshrines the right</a> to \u201cclean air, pure water and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment\u201d, unlike neighboring New York, which is among a handful of states to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/nyregion/cuomo-to-ban-fracking-in-new-york-state-citing-health-risks.html\">ban fracking</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea you have to court some fictional rural fracking supporter with Trump signs in their yard is ludicrous,\u201d said Josh Fox, a film-maker and activist whose 2010 documentary <a href=\"https://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/gasland-2010/\">Gasland</a> showed people in Dimock and elsewhere holding up jars of muddy brown drinking water and turning their tap water into a roaring flame by lighting it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/13/pennsylvania-fracking-children-illnesses\">Rare cancers, full-body rashes, death: did fracking make their kids sick?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDemocrats have been foolish to give up the votes of people fighting for their lives. It\u2019s clear they are afraid of the oil and gas industry,\u201d he said. Fox added he will still vote for Harris but that \u201cDemocrats have thrown away a chance to tell people in rural Pennsylvania they will fight to protect their children from toxins. It\u2019s a legacy of moral failure going back to Obama.\u201d</p> <p>In Dimock, particular ire is reserved for Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic governor, who in his previous role as state attorney general in 2020 convened a grand jury and <a href=\"https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/06/15/pa-attorney-general-charges-cabot-oil-and-gas-with-environmental-crimes/\">charged Coterra</a>, then known as Cabot, prior to a merger, with eight felonies for endangering the town\u2019s drinking water. \u201cThere were failures at every level,\u201d Shapiro claimed, pointing to testimony of children in Dimock waking up with severe nosebleeds because of the pollution exposure.</p>    <p>Yet, the denouement of the case in a local courtroom in 2022 unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/ag-shapiro-announces-plea-public-water-line-construction-for-victims-of-cabot-oil-gas/\">deal</a> in which all the felony charges were dropped, with Coterra pleading no contest to a single misdemeanor in return for the company agreeing to build a new $16m water pipe for residents. Crucially, on the same day, the state department of environmental protection \u2013 which had found Coterra tainted 19 private wells and <a href=\"https://files.dep.state.pa.us/oilgas/OilGasLandingPageFiles/FinalCO&amp;A121510.pdf\">barred drilling in the Dimock area for more than a decade</a> \u2013 allowed the company back into the region.</p> <p>\u201cI was shocked. I was a fan of Shapiro but he betrayed us. He betrayed me,\u201d said Switzer, who took part in a press conference with Shapiro, prior to knowing details of the deal, where she praised the then attorney general.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could retract that. I would\u2019ve called out that traitor Shapiro if I\u2019d known,\u201d she said. \u201cWe walked into a trap that allowed the drilling to restart. I mean, when I heard he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/02/josh-shapiro-kamala-harris\">in the mix</a> to be vice-president I almost threw up.\u201d</p>    <p>A spokesman for Shapiro said he is an \u201can all-of-the-above energy governor, and he is taking action to invest in affordable and reliable renewable energy while continuing to support the key energy resources that have helped Pennsylvania become the leader it is today\u201d. The settlement with Coterra is \u201chistoric\u201d, the spokesman said, and that the governor \u201cwill never forget the people of Dimock\u201d. Coterra did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The water line should emerge by the end of 2026, although construction of it, unlike the new drilling, has yet to start. Coterra is not allowed to drill directly in the heart of Dimock but can do so at its edges, and already has three towering well complexes boring 7,000ft down into a section of the Marcellus shale, a thick formation of layered, <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1408855#:~:text=Of%20those%20available%20from%20the,%E2%80%94Ra%20(Barbot%20et%20al\">radioactive</a> rock, which contains about 1.3tn cubic feet of gas worth an estimated $3.9bn.</p> <p>From these wellheads sprout 11 drilling lines, known as laterals, that bend underground horizontally and snake for several miles underneath about 80 Dimock properties, with one running directly under Switzer\u2019s house. \u201cThey are cutting up the valley like Swiss cheese,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The rumbling from a new oil pad two miles away keeps Switzer awake at night, as does the hundreds of trucks shuttling the vast cocktail of water, sand and chemicals used in fracking. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep now, so I find it harder to take than I once did,\u201d she said. \u201cWe came here to enjoy nature, and this has just torn our lives apart.\u201d</p>    <p>This new drilling requires Coterra to monitor local water supplies, plug the older gas wells that dot this rolling landscape and provide water to residents. Still, avoiding further contamination as the drills pierce the water table, via failures in the drill casings or leaks of the substances used to pry open the shale for its gas, cannot be fully assured.</p> <p>\u201cThe operations are on a much larger scale now, using millions of gallons more water, so no company can guarantee there will be no further leaks. Once wells are drilled they will leak,\u201d said Anthony Ingraffea, an environmental engineer at Cornell University who has advised affected residents.</p> <p>\u201cThe nine square miles of Dimock is a goldmine of natural gas. It\u2019s the most productive in the world,\u201d Ingraffea said. \u201cCoterra will be happy getting hold of that in return for a water pipeline that I don\u2019t think will ever be built.

      "bodyText": "Fracking has burst back on to the national stage in the US presidential election contest for the must-win swing state of Pennsylvania. But for one town in this state that saw its water become mud-brown, undrinkable and even flammable 15 years ago, the specter of fracking never went away. Residents in Dimock, a rural town of around 1,200 people in north-east Pennsylvania, have been locked in a lengthy battle to remediate their water supply that was ruined in 2009 after the drilling of dozens of wells to access a hotspot called the \u201cSaudi Arabia of gas\u201d found deep underneath their homes. The company behind the drilling, Texas-based Coterra, was barred from the area for years for its role in poisoning the private water wells Dimock relies upon and, in a landmark later move in 2020, was charged with multiple crimes. But it has now been ushered back into the area following a deal struck by the state\u2019s Democratic leadership. The re-starting of drilling around Dimock late last year comes as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris clamor to cast themselves to Pennsylvania voters as supporters of fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected deep underground to extract embedded oil and gas. \u201cIf she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one,\u201d Trump said of Harris, who previously supported a ban, during the duo\u2019s televised debate last month. The former US president has run a barrage of ads in the state accusing Harris of wanting to shut down the fracking industry. But during the same debate, Harris insisted \u201cI will not ban fracking\u201d, with the vice-president boasting of new fracking leases granted during Joe Biden\u2019s administration. This bipartisan embrace of fracking has stirred fury among residents of Dimock whose well water is still riddled by toxins linked to an array of health problems and, most spectacularly, contains so much flammable methane that people have passed out in the shower, wells exploded, and water running from the tap could be set on fire by match, according to official reports and accounts from locals. \u201cSure as hell, I\u2019m not voting for either of those two assholes,\u201d said Ray Kemble, a bearded military veteran and former trucker, as he puffed on a cigar in his home. Reams of documents and photos chronicling the long fight against fracking lay on the table next to Kemble, along with a bottle of his murky tap water, three Sherlock Holmes-style smoking pipes and a briefcase filled with handguns. Shortly after a gas well was drilled a few hundred feet from Kemble\u2019s home, he said his drinking water turned from dark brown to green and finally jet black, with the liquid smelling like he had taken \u201cevery household chemical you can think of, dump it into a blender, take two asses of a skunk and put that in there, put it on puree, dump it out, and take a whiff\u201d. \u201cThe water is still not fixed,\u201d said Kemble, who blames the loss of most of his teeth to the presence of uranium, along with other contaminants such as copper and arsenic, in his water. \u201cWhen a politicians\u2019 lips are moving they are lying,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fricking nightmare. We are back to square one from before the moratorium came into effect \u2013 there\u2019s massive drilling like crazy. I don\u2019t care who you are, rich, poor, or whatever, without water and clean air and clean soil, we\u2019re all freaking dead.\u201d Kemble, a Republican who has printed cards featuring the Gadsen flag snake coiled around a gas well, has found unlikely allies in this saga, with figures such as Yoko Ono and Mark Ruffalo voicing concern for Dimock\u2019s plight. His neighbor Victoria Switzer, a former school teacher turned artist whose paintings adorn a soaring timber-framed home beside a bucolic creek, is a rare liberal in this staunchly conservative county but also shares Kemble\u2019s frustration. \u201cI like Kamala, but I was unhappy when she said she wouldn\u2019t ban fracking,\u201d said Switzer, who said her water bubbled \u201clike Alka-Seltzer\u201d after the drilling started. Like Kemble, she now gets bottled water deliveries each week from Coterra. \u201cBut then the other guy [Trump] just says, \u2018We\u2019ll drill more, we\u2019ll get rid of the regulations\u2019 \u2013 so that should scare us. People are held hostage by the fossil-fuel industry here.\u201d Although 1.5 million people across Pennsylvania live within half a mile of oil and gas wells, compressors and processors, not all feel as sharply affected by fracking and to win the state\u2019s crucial 19 electoral votes, according to prevailing political thinking, means not threatening an industry that directly employs around 16,000 people, around 0.5% of all jobs in the state. \u201cFracking has become a big part of the election but there really isn\u2019t much opposition to it now, it\u2019s become part of life in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Jeff Brauer, a political scientist at Pennsylvania\u2019s Keystone College. \u201cA fracking ban would be very unpopular and Kamala Harris knows she can\u2019t be against fracking if she\u2019s going to win here. She had to clean that up.\u201d But how popular is fracking? Polling shows a complicated picture rather than overwhelming support, with two 2020 surveys showing slightly more Pennsylvania voters want to ban fracking than keep it, while a separate 2022 poll found the reverse. Unusually, Pennsylvania\u2019s constitution enshrines the right to \u201cclean air, pure water and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment\u201d, unlike neighboring New York, which is among a handful of states to ban fracking. \u201cThe idea you have to court some fictional rural fracking supporter with Trump signs in their yard is ludicrous,\u201d said Josh Fox, a film-maker and activist whose 2010 documentary Gasland showed people in Dimock and elsewhere holding up jars of muddy brown drinking water and turning their tap water into a roaring flame by lighting it. \u201cDemocrats have been foolish to give up the votes of people fighting for their lives. It\u2019s clear they are afraid of the oil and gas industry,\u201d he said. Fox added he will still vote for Harris but that \u201cDemocrats have thrown away a chance to tell people in rural Pennsylvania they will fight to protect their children from toxins. It\u2019s a legacy of moral failure going back to Obama.\u201d In Dimock, particular ire is reserved for Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic governor, who in his previous role as state attorney general in 2020 convened a grand jury and charged Coterra, then known as Cabot, prior to a merger, with eight felonies for endangering the town\u2019s drinking water. \u201cThere were failures at every level,\u201d Shapiro claimed, pointing to testimony of children in Dimock waking up with severe nosebleeds because of the pollution exposure. Yet, the denouement of the case in a local courtroom in 2022 unveiled a deal in which all the felony charges were dropped, with Coterra pleading no contest to a single misdemeanor in return for the company agreeing to build a new $16m water pipe for residents. Crucially, on the same day, the state department of environmental protection \u2013 which had found Coterra tainted 19 private wells and barred drilling in the Dimock area for more than a decade \u2013 allowed the company back into the region. \u201cI was shocked. I was a fan of Shapiro but he betrayed us. He betrayed me,\u201d said Switzer, who took part in a press conference with Shapiro, prior to knowing details of the deal, where she praised the then attorney general. \u201cI wish I could retract that. I would\u2019ve called out that traitor Shapiro if I\u2019d known,\u201d she said. \u201cWe walked into a trap that allowed the drilling to restart. I mean, when I heard he was in the mix to be vice-president I almost threw up.\u201d A spokesman for Shapiro said he is an \u201can all-of-the-above energy governor, and he is taking action to invest in affordable and reliable renewable energy while continuing to support the key energy resources that have helped Pennsylvania become the leader it is today\u201d. The settlement with Coterra is \u201chistoric\u201d, the spokesman said, and that the governor \u201cwill never forget the people of Dimock\u201d. Coterra did not respond to a request for comment. The water line should emerge by the end of 2026, although construction of it, unlike the new drilling, has yet to start. Coterra is not allowed to drill directly in the heart of Dimock but can do so at its edges, and already has three towering well complexes boring 7,000ft down into a section of the Marcellus shale, a thick formation of layered, radioactive rock, which contains about 1.3tn cubic feet of gas worth an estimated $3.9bn. From these wellheads sprout 11 drilling lines, known as laterals, that bend underground horizontally and snake for several miles underneath about 80 Dimock properties, with one running directly under Switzer\u2019s house. \u201cThey are cutting up the valley like Swiss cheese,\u201d she said. The rumbling from a new oil pad two miles away keeps Switzer awake at night, as does the hundreds of trucks shuttling the vast cocktail of water, sand and chemicals used in fracking. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep now, so I find it harder to take than I once did,\u201d she said. \u201cWe came here to enjoy nature, and this has just torn our lives apart.\u201d This new drilling requires Coterra to monitor local water supplies, plug the older gas wells that dot this rolling landscape and provide water to residents. Still, avoiding further contamination as the drills pierce the water table, via failures in the drill casings or leaks of the substances used to pry open the shale for its gas, cannot be fully assured. \u201cThe operations are on a much larger scale now, using millions of gallons more water, so no company can guarantee there will be no further leaks. Once wells are drilled they will leak,\u201d said Anthony Ingraffea, an environmental engineer at Cornell University who has advised affected residents. \u201cThe nine square miles of Dimock is a goldmine of natural gas. It\u2019s the most productive in the world,\u201d Ingraffea said. \u201cCoterra will be happy getting hold of that in return for a water pipeline that I don\u2019t think will ever be built. It\u2019s teasingly cruel to do this to people. When you look at people in Dimock, you see pain and uncertainty in their eyes.\u201d Much of the newly drilled gas will be shipped overseas and marketed as a \u201cclean\u201d fuel in a process that, in fact, emits more planet-heating pollution than coal. The fracking itself, which is exempt from certain clean water regulations, will also pose fresh health risks, with studies showing that Pennsylvanians who live near fracking are at heightened risk of childhood lymphoma, asthma, pre-term births and low birth weights. The Environmental Protection Agency, however, only regulates 29 out of more than 1,100 shale gas contaminants potentially found in drinking water, with a 2016 federal report acknowledging that wells in 27 Dimock homes contain unhealthy levels of lead, cadmium, arsenic and copper, with 17 of these homes at risk of exploding because of the build-up of flammable gas. For Kemble, the resumption of drilling is the final straw after years of him and his neighbors suffering cancers he believes is a result of the air and water pollution. Kemble said he has rigged up cameras at his home and fears he could be targeted for his activism. Despite the pressure around being outspoken, Kemble said: \u201cI\u2019m still here \u2026 but one of these wells will blow up like Old Faithful in Yellowstone one day.

      "body": "  <p>Once upon a time, it was mainly graphic designers and visual artists who spent their days dabbling with filters, fonts, logos and image-editing tools. Today, many of us have become pretty adept at producing and editing our own visual content \u2013 from intuitively cropping and filtering photos on the go to wheeling out cinema-worthy Instagram reels, slick TikTok transitions, or eye-catching flyers and posters. And all in a matter of minutes with just a few clicks or swipes.</p> <p>We might not even notice just how sophisticated we\u2019re being because we\u2019ve become so accustomed to communicating visually \u2013 instinctively dropping images, emojis, gifs and memes into our digital conversations and stepping up how we present our lives and work online.</p> <p>AI-assisted design tools \u2013 from background removers, image expanders and text-to-image generators \u2013 take things even further. Used in combination with other tools, they effectively allow us to \u201cimagine\u201d an image on to a screen, and have become an invaluable part of intuitive content software and apps such as <a href=\"https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/1/250188;8780122;4938332;211;0/?gdpr=${GDPR}&amp;gdpr_consent=${GDPR_CONSENT_78}&amp;us_privacy=${US_PRIVACY}&amp;url=39967971\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adobe Express</a>, which allows you to create designs easily and for free. They\u2019re an easy way to embrace the new world of generative AI, helping you navigate commercial and copyright issues while seamlessly incorporating these new visual super skills into your existing work and images.</p> <p>To fully appreciate how we\u2019ve become so au fait with all these skills now at our fingertips, it\u2019s worth considering how the technology also taps into something deeper. Design and visual communication have become second nature to most of us partly thanks to the way our minds work. \u201cGenerally, our brains are built to process images faster than words,\u201d says clinical psychotherapist Dipti Tait. \u201cThis is why visuals, from advertising billboards to the emojis and memes we send loved ones, have become a universal language of their very own,\u201d she says. \u201cWe process visuals incredibly quickly \u2013 <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2014/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-0116#:~:text=You%20might%20think%20it%20would,of%20such%20rapid%20processing%20speed.\" rel=\"nofollow\">our brains can easily make sense of an image or video that the eye sees for as little as 13 milliseconds</a>.\u201d</p>    <p>Not only do we process images faster than words, but they stick around longer, too. \u201cVisuals usually make a bigger impact than words and leave a lasting impression thanks to something called the \u2018picture superiority effect\u2019,\u201d explains Tait. \u201cThis is the phenomenon where people remember pictures better than the corresponding word.

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time, it was mainly graphic designers and visual artists who spent their days dabbling with filters, fonts, logos and image-editing tools. Today, many of us have become pretty adept at producing and editing our own visual content \u2013 from intuitively cropping and filtering photos on the go to wheeling out cinema-worthy Instagram reels, slick TikTok transitions, or eye-catching flyers and posters. And all in a matter of minutes with just a few clicks or swipes. We might not even notice just how sophisticated we\u2019re being because we\u2019ve become so accustomed to communicating visually \u2013 instinctively dropping images, emojis, gifs and memes into our digital conversations and stepping up how we present our lives and work online. AI-assisted design tools \u2013 from background removers, image expanders and text-to-image generators \u2013 take things even further. Used in combination with other tools, they effectively allow us to \u201cimagine\u201d an image on to a screen, and have become an invaluable part of intuitive content software and apps such as Adobe Express, which allows you to create designs easily and for free. They\u2019re an easy way to embrace the new world of generative AI, helping you navigate commercial and copyright issues while seamlessly incorporating these new visual super skills into your existing work and images. To fully appreciate how we\u2019ve become so au fait with all these skills now at our fingertips, it\u2019s worth considering how the technology also taps into something deeper. Design and visual communication have become second nature to most of us partly thanks to the way our minds work. \u201cGenerally, our brains are built to process images faster than words,\u201d says clinical psychotherapist Dipti Tait. \u201cThis is why visuals, from advertising billboards to the emojis and memes we send loved ones, have become a universal language of their very own,\u201d she says. \u201cWe process visuals incredibly quickly \u2013 our brains can easily make sense of an image or video that the eye sees for as little as 13 milliseconds.\u201d Not only do we process images faster than words, but they stick around longer, too. \u201cVisuals usually make a bigger impact than words and leave a lasting impression thanks to something called the \u2018picture superiority effect\u2019,\u201d explains Tait. \u201cThis is the phenomenon where people remember pictures better than the corresponding word. In this way, images work as a visual anchor, helping our brains quickly file away and retrieve information.\u201d It\u2019s why a random meme you saw six months ago stays lodged in your memory above a recent conversation with a friend or colleague. It also helps explain our collective love for communicating via emojis and visual prompts. More than 90% (pdf) of us use emojis regularly when communicating online, with more than 70bn sent daily. \u201cThe brain craves simplicity and visuals like emojis cut through complication easily and quickly,\u201d says Tait. \u201cAs a therapist, I often incorporate visual aids, such as drawings or flowcharts, in the therapy room \u2013 it gets to the bottom of challenging issues faster and really helps us understand one another better. Why try to explain something for 10 minutes when you can show them instead?\u201d Indeed, efficiency is a key factor, according to communications expert James Bore, who specialises in information theory \u2013 AKA the mathematical theory of communication. \u201cPictographs \u2013 which is really what emojis are \u2013 are an incredibly efficient way to transmit information and the informational content is huge compared to physically typing out words,\u201d he says. Forget dictating a lengthy reply to someone\u2019s question \u2013 just ping back an emoji as acknowledgement instead. \u201cReceiving a \u2018thumbs up\u2019 visual instead of a written message saying: \u2018I am pleased about this,\u2019 is not only more efficient, but it also carries useful additional information about the context in terms of tone or clarity,\u201d says Bore. And let\u2019s not forget that speaking \u201cvisually\u201d \u2013 whether via emojis, photographs or videos \u2013 enables us to communicate without actually having to say anything. Instead of making ourselves vulnerable by sharing how we feel in verbal form (\u201cI\u2019m sort of feeling low today \u2026\u201d) we can share a meme of a cat crying and our audience instinctively \u201cgets\u201d it \u2013 and us. \u201cBecause we all live in the same physical world, pictograms are automatically understandable without any additional layers of abstraction needed,\u201d says Bore. \u201cWhether they\u2019re warning signs or smileys, a well-designed pictogram really is worth a thousand words.\u201d Communicating via visuals also feels good. \u201cTypically, when greeted with a real-life smile, the amygdala in our brain \u2013 our emotional processing hub \u2013 lights up,\u201d says Tait. \u201cThe same is true for receiving a smiley emoji \u2013 it helps create a sense of warmth and trust, tapping into our brain\u2019s natural chemistry.

      "body": "  <p>Daniel England, 38, has been creating flyers, posters, artwork and zines since he was a teenager. At first, he made them to promote the bands he played in. Later, for his full-time job producing and promoting comedy. Latterly, he\u2019s been making them for his new pursuit as a radio DJ and presenter.</p> <p>In that time, technology and tougher competition for people\u2019s attention have meant that the quality and format of flyers have evolved dramatically. Visuals have become an increasingly important part of his efforts to gain audiences and traction.</p> <p>\u201cThe way creatives share work is predominantly visual, because people tend to hear about your work through social media,\u201d England says. \u201cThere are now so many producers, musicians and DJs trying to get across their work, so you need to sum your brand up really succinctly via an Instagram post people can instantly connect with, which is where visual branding comes in.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also one of the most rewarding aspects of his work, whether he\u2019s focusing on his day job or his radio show: \u201cI really enjoy creating artwork and visuals to go with my work. I\u2019ve been in bands since I was 15, when I\u2019d make posters and flyers for gigs and in comedy, there are so many opportunities to make artwork and branding to get your work out there. It\u2019s not just my industry either \u2013 most people\u2019s social media feeds are now an extension of the \u2018thing\u2019 they make and it allows you to really build on what you do and shape the identity of what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>Speed is often essential, especially when promoting comedy events at festivals, when he can find himself literally having to produce flyers on the fly. He uses <a href=\"https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/1/250188;8780123;4938333;211;0/?gdpr=${GDPR}&amp;gdpr_consent=${GDPR_CONSENT_78}&amp;us_privacy=${US_PRIVACY}&amp;url=39967970\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adobe Express</a>, an intuitive app to help create anything. \u201cIt\u2019s great for those professional jobs that need to get done quickly. It makes my workload easier, especially when it comes to promoting events, such as the Edinburgh festival fringe, which can require such a quick turnaround time.\u201d</p> <p>As with many people, England found himself exploring new creative outlets during the pandemic lockdowns. \u201cMy nine to five is working as a comedy producer \u2013 I\u2019ve worked in comedy for more than a decade now, but the radio side of things kicked off during the pandemic,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d noticed friends sharing mixes and DJ sets on Facebook or Instagram Live as a way of connecting during the lockdowns and having always been the \u2018go-to\u2019 DJ at friends\u2019 weddings I thought: \u2018OK, I\u2019ll have a go at that.\u2019 Soon I was streaming weekly radio shows on Twitch, with friends playing my shows at home when we couldn\u2019t all physically be together.\u201d</p> <p>When \u201cnormal\u201d life resumed, England found himself missing those DJ sets and set about finding regular radio gigs instead, landing the first at a South African radio station. \u201cThe job \u2013 one show a month \u2013 meant I\u2019d record it and send it to them, with the station sending me assets which I\u2019d edit at home using Adobe \u2013 pictures and videos for social media or their website, to create things such as tracklists, show artwork or information about the music I\u2019d played. Using Adobe meant I could quickly repurpose artwork or extend backgrounds and cut out imagery, cleaning up assets neatly to share online.\u201d</p> <p>England now presents The Damn England Breakfast Show every other Sunday on London-based Voices Radio. \u201cI produce all the artwork and promotional material for my show myself. Having access to quick and easy platforms to edit assets is essential,\u201d he says.<strong> </strong>\u201cWe have a lot of creative freedom at Voices \u2013 the identity of the station has been built up through the people with shows there, which allows us to really experiment with things like our visuals and branding.\u201d</p> <p>His advice for other budding creatives hoping to utilise today\u2019s visual design tools to make their own mark doing something they love? \u201cFor anyone still trying to figure out what their \u2018thing\u2019 is, don\u2019t be afraid of trying something new. My ethos is \u2018You don\u2019t need to be an expert, just have a go!\u2019.\u201d</p>    <p><strong>Beyond the creative sector<br></strong>However, it isn\u2019t just the creative industries harnessing the power of today\u2019s intuitive design tools. Dr Thuva Amuthan founded a skin and aesthetics clinic DrDerme.com, and says good visuals have been essential. \u201cBranding and visuals are key in healthcare, as consumers are, quite rightly, trying to determine your credibility and trustworthiness, so that first impression matters a huge amount,\u201d he says. \u201cIt means our branding has to give an immediately fresh, clean, professional appearance \u2013 people want to visit a reputable clinic because they\u2019re trusting you with their health.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stand-out-by-design/2024/oct/21/stop-the-scroll-expert-advice-from-a-brand-designer-to-help-you-stand-out-on-social-media\">Stop the scroll: expert advice from a brand designer to help you stand out on social media</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using Adobe Express and Photoshop, Amuthan designs his own website and social media content. \u201cI use Photoshop for critical content such as logos and banners \u2013 assets I want to use repeatedly, for example. I\u2019ll then use Adobe Express for faster jobs to produce lots of content in a series, like sharing reviews of our clinic on social media. I\u2019ll make a template, which enables me to change the text each time with different feedback, rather than redoing it from scratch. That way it\u2019s consistent and fast to turn around.\u201d</p> <p>The software is as enjoyable as it is intuitive, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been artistic and interested in tech, and started messing around with design as a teenager, but I think what programmes like Adobe Express do well is they keep it simple. Sometimes perfectionists like me can get too bogged down in fine-tuning elements to make everything \u2018perfect\u2019 but this makes it easy to produce content in bulk without too much difficulty, which makes a huge difference to productivity. After all, \u2018done\u2019 is the new \u2018perfect\u2019, right?\u201d</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/1/250188;8780123;4938333;211;0/?gdpr=${GDPR}&amp;gdpr_consent=${GDPR_CONSENT_78}&amp;us_privacy=${US_PRIVACY}&amp;url=39967970\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here</a> to learn more about Adobe Express</strong></em></p>",

It makes my workload easier, especially when it comes to promoting events, such as the Edinburgh festival fringe, which can require such a quick turnaround time.\u201d As with many people, England found himself exploring new creative outlets during the pandemic lockdowns. \u201cMy nine to five is working as a comedy producer \u2013 I\u2019ve worked in comedy for more than a decade now, but the radio side of things kicked off during the pandemic,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d noticed friends sharing mixes and DJ sets on Facebook or Instagram Live as a way of connecting during the lockdowns and having always been the \u2018go-to\u2019 DJ at friends\u2019 weddings I thought: \u2018OK, I\u2019ll have a go at that.\u2019 Soon I was streaming weekly radio shows on Twitch, with friends playing my shows at home when we couldn\u2019t all physically be together.\u201d When \u201cnormal\u201d life resumed, England found himself missing those DJ sets and set about finding regular radio gigs instead, landing the first at a South African radio station. \u201cThe job \u2013 one show a month \u2013 meant I\u2019d record it and send it to them, with the station sending me assets which I\u2019d edit at home using Adobe \u2013 pictures and videos for social media or their website, to create things such as tracklists, show artwork or information about the music I\u2019d played. Using Adobe meant I could quickly repurpose artwork or extend backgrounds and cut out imagery, cleaning up assets neatly to share online.\u201d England now presents The Damn England Breakfast Show every other Sunday on London-based Voices Radio. \u201cI produce all the artwork and promotional material for my show myself. Having access to quick and easy platforms to edit assets is essential,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a lot of creative freedom at Voices \u2013 the identity of the station has been built up through the people with shows there, which allows us to really experiment with things like our visuals and branding.\u201d His advice for other budding creatives hoping to utilise today\u2019s visual design tools to make their own mark doing something they love? \u201cFor anyone still trying to figure out what their \u2018thing\u2019 is, don\u2019t be afraid of trying something new. My ethos is \u2018You don\u2019t need to be an expert, just have a go!\u2019.\u201d Beyond the creative sector However, it isn\u2019t just the creative industries harnessing the power of today\u2019s intuitive design tools. Dr Thuva Amuthan founded a skin and aesthetics clinic DrDerme.com, and says good visuals have been essential. \u201cBranding and visuals are key in healthcare, as consumers are, quite rightly, trying to determine your credibility and trustworthiness, so that first impression matters a huge amount,\u201d he says. \u201cIt means our branding has to give an immediately fresh, clean, professional appearance \u2013 people want to visit a reputable clinic because they\u2019re trusting you with their health.\u201d Using Adobe Express and Photoshop, Amuthan designs his own website and social media content. \u201cI use Photoshop for critical content such as logos and banners \u2013 assets I want to use repeatedly, for example. I\u2019ll then use Adobe Express for faster jobs to produce lots of content in a series, like sharing reviews of our clinic on social media. I\u2019ll make a template, which enables me to change the text each time with different feedback, rather than redoing it from scratch. That way it\u2019s consistent and fast to turn around.\u201d The software is as enjoyable as it is intuitive, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been artistic and interested in tech, and started messing around with design as a teenager, but I think what programmes like Adobe Express do well is they keep it simple. Sometimes perfectionists like me can get too bogged down in fine-tuning elements to make everything \u2018perfect\u2019 but this makes it easy to produce content in bulk without too much difficulty, which makes a huge difference to productivity. After all, \u2018done\u2019 is the new \u2018perfect\u2019, right?\u201d Click here to learn more about Adobe Express",

Luckily, there are ways we can make our designs stand out and work well, no matter our experience or background \u2026</p> <p><strong>Consider colour carefully <br></strong>One of the most effective \u2013 and simple \u2013 ways to communicate visually is through colour. But knowing where to start can prove tricky, says Mosley. \u201cColour is incredibly emotive and powerful, so it\u2019s worth thinking about what you\u2019re trying to convey and figuring out the colours in your design palette as a priority. Ask yourself, what sort of messaging do you want to get across?\u201d</p> <p>Even when you opt for black and white designs or typography, it can really pay off to consider basic design principles. \u201cA solid black font on a solid white background can be quite challenging for the eye,\u201d says Mosley. \u201c[Whereas] a slightly off-black font (an extremely dark grey, for example) on a slightly off-white background still looks \u2018black and white\u2019 to the eye but is softer and easier to read.

Good design means making things easy for your audience \u2013 if not, they\u2019ll give up and go elsewhere. Left-aligning text and ensuring it\u2019s not too closely bunched together (either the words themselves or the line spacing) means your brain can easily assimilate what\u2019s being shared. Making your work as easy as possible for people to digest and consume means they\u2019re much more likely to interact with it.\u201d</p>    <p><strong>Have fun with animation<br></strong>Animation might sound complicated, but it can actually help to simplify videos or concepts, as well as bringing ideas to life, making them more memorable.

When the founder of comparative anatomy, Georges Cuvier, performed an autopsy after her death the following year, it was in an attempt to discover if her body was the connection between animals and humans.

Rather than the standard eight-hour workday, I worked 10-hour days three days in a row in my NHS job.

      "bodyText": "The side hustle has become central to modern living. Nearly 50% of Brits have a side hustle, with nine out of 10 \u201cside hustlers\u201d who are under 34 planning to transition said hustle into a full-time business. But juggling your side hustle with your day job can be tricky even for the most skilled multitasker. So here are some tips for managing multiple gigs without annoying your boss or colleagues Compartmentalise while cross-fertilising Try to view your day job as a source of inspiration and insights rather than an obstacle to your side-hustle. Your life will feel more coherent and less draining. And perhaps counterintuitively, cross-fertilising inspiration can help you focus on each gig better.

The government-controlled joint select committee on social media and Australian society has released its second interim report, focused on Meta\u2019s decision to abandon its deals with Australian news organisations under the news media bargaining code. A final report from the committee will focus on online safety, the influence of algorithms on social media feeds, the effects of social media on the mental health of users and age verification technology. The two key recommendations of the report tabled Monday evening are designed to deal with the decision by Meta \u2013 owner of Facebook \u2013 to abandon the deals it signed three years ago to pay media companies for news. The recommendations from the Labor-controlled committee \u2013 chaired by Newcastle MP Sharon Claydon \u2013 do not represent official government policy and the responsible ministers have not immediately commented on the report. But the recommendations offer potential insight into the government\u2019s thinking on ensuring media sustainability and addressing the influence of the social media companies. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email In 2021, Google and Meta signed deals with Australian media companies to pay for news after the then Coalition government set up the news media bargaining code. The code contained powers to \u201cdesignate\u201d social media companies \u2013 forcing them into deals with traditional media companies or face fines of 10% of their Australian revenue. But in March Meta announced it would not renew its funding deals and the Albanese government has since speculated on a levy as a way to extract revenue \u2013 for Australian media companies \u2013 without a potentially protracted designation battle. \u201cWe think that social media companies have a social obligation as well,\u201d the prime minister said in August. \u201cThat they shouldn\u2019t be able to, essentially, harvest the work of news organisations that pay their journalists to do work, that should be valued. That is important.\u201d The Labor-dominated parliamentary committee report said, given the exposed limitations of the bargaining code, the government should \u201cexplore alternative revenue mechanisms to supplement the code \u2026 such as a digital platform levy\u201d. The committee heard evidence Australia could introduce a \u201cdigital services tax\u201d, like the 2% tax introduced in the UK and in France, or a Public Interest Journalism Levy to which social media companies would be compelled to contribute. The committee said the government\u2019s exploration of a levy on social media companies \u201cshould include consideration for preserving current and future commercial deals to sustain public interest journalism over the longer term, and to support digital media literacy initiatives\u201d. The second major recommendation was for a fund to support media companies struggling to sustain public interest journalism in the face of collapsing advertising revenues. \u201cGiven Meta\u2019s decision not to renew deals under the news media bargaining code, and the de-prioritisation of news on Meta platforms, the committee recommends that the Australian government establish a short-term transition fund to help news media businesses to diversify and strengthen alternative income streams and news product offerings. \u201cThe fund should have a particular focus on supporting small, independent and digital only publishers, as well as those operating in under-served communities and rural, regional and remote areas.\u201d Committee chair Sharon Claydon said Australians were concerned about the impact of social media on communities, including on access to accurate and reliable news. \u201cThis report highlights the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks to protect Australians from the harmful effects of social media,\u201d she said. Deputy committee chair, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, the Greens communications spokesperson, said firms such as Meta operate in Australia and benefit from Australian communities, \u201cyet will stop at nothing to ensure they do not have to adhere to Australian laws or give anything back to those they profit off\u201d. She said the actions of transnational tech companies \u2013 in spite of their economic power \u2013 must be reined in by strong government regulation. \u201cThe potential for Meta to remove news from their platforms will create a void for mis- and dis-information, while in turn their refusal to pay for the news it carries will impact Australian jobs and the quality of public interest journalism in Australia. Tech platforms must be held responsible for creating the very spaces that drive division, abuse and conspiracy theories.\u201d Four Coalition members of committee rejected the report\u2019s assertion the news media bargaining code was not fit for purpose, instead accusing the Albanese government of capitulation in its dealings with the tech companies. \u201cThe news media bargaining code was designed to give government powerful tools to hold social media companies to account for the commercial benefits they gain from use of Australian news content,\u201d the opposition members said. \u201cThe Albanese government has been weak in its handling of this issue.\u201d",

The death of John Kinsel Sr, 107, on Saturday left just two living Navajo code talkers: his fellow US marines Thomas Begay and Peter MacDonald, who are both in their 90s. A longtime resident of Lukachukai, Arizona, near the New Mexico state line, Kinsel was one of about 400 members of the Indigenous Navajo nation who used their native Dine language to help create a code that allowed the US military to communicate securely during the second world war. The US\u2019s enemies never broke the code before their defeat.

      "body": "<p>My dad, Michael Brooks, was an archivist, a music salvage expert. He worked deep into old age at Sony\u2019s New York office: curating the company\u2019s labyrinthine back catalogue; sourcing and restoring antique steel recordings. Possibly, we all circle back to the songs of our youth, but Dad went upriver and made the past his profession. On workdays he sat in a Manhattan studio and listened to the dead sing and play on a two-track Studer tape deck.</p> <p>Sony Music is a behemoth, the industry\u2019s biggest hitter, with annual earnings of about $10.7bn (\u00a38bn) and a lineup of talent (Springsteen, Beyonc\u00e9, Jackson, Bowie) that reads like a rock\u2019n\u2019roll hall of fame. But Sony\u2019s marquee names are only the tip of the iceberg. For every Diana Ross, Johnny Cash or Billy Joel who struck gold, there were a hundred other signed artists who didn\u2019t. For every song that is in print and available, there are at least 10 that are mothballed in storage, an estimated 2.5m pieces that may as well not exist. Popular taste has decreed that these lost songs are failures. But tastes change, markets shift and yesterday\u2019s flop might be today\u2019s buried treasure. \u201cA lot of it is awful,\u201d my dad used to say. \u201cBut even the awful work is interesting, significant, and now and again you stumble across something special.\u201d</p> <p>In October 2018, I tagged along on what would turn out to be my father\u2019s last day at work. He was 82 and had suffered a stroke and was functioning at half speed. I have PTSD flashbacks of him leaning precipitously over the platform edge to check for the approach of the uptown train, and hobbling with his stick through the rush-hour crowds at Penn station. My dad loved his job and Sony valued his expertise, but his body was failing and the commute took its toll. He worked until lunch then reached for his coat: he was done.</p> <p>My dad\u2019s work had intrigued me for years. It sounded like a blend of the exotic and the eccentric \u2013 an Indiana Jones expedition for rare vinyl nerds \u2013 and so I took a notepad and Dictaphone along that day. The plan was to write a feature about music archiving but life intervened, as it usually does, and I wound up sticking the material in a drawer, as though it were a flop disco album or a failed Sony soul singer. Revisiting it now, six years later, is strange. Every recording carries the air of a seance, because we are listening to people who are no longer physically there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In this job you\u2019ll hear stuff that you\u2019ve never heard before \u2013 and maybe never will again</p> <footer> <cite>Matt Cavaluzzo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the Dictaphone it\u2019s still autumn 2018.

The plan is to upload the remastered 60s recordings to iTunes. That way Sony keeps them in copyright, in circulation and out of the public domain. Ideally, this unlocks a new revenue stream.

      "bodyText": "My dad, Michael Brooks, was an archivist, a music salvage expert. He worked deep into old age at Sony\u2019s New York office: curating the company\u2019s labyrinthine back catalogue; sourcing and restoring antique steel recordings. Possibly, we all circle back to the songs of our youth, but Dad went upriver and made the past his profession. On workdays he sat in a Manhattan studio and listened to the dead sing and play on a two-track Studer tape deck. Sony Music is a behemoth, the industry\u2019s biggest hitter, with annual earnings of about $10.7bn (\u00a38bn) and a lineup of talent (Springsteen, Beyonc\u00e9, Jackson, Bowie) that reads like a rock\u2019n\u2019roll hall of fame. But Sony\u2019s marquee names are only the tip of the iceberg. For every Diana Ross, Johnny Cash or Billy Joel who struck gold, there were a hundred other signed artists who didn\u2019t. For every song that is in print and available, there are at least 10 that are mothballed in storage, an estimated 2.5m pieces that may as well not exist. Popular taste has decreed that these lost songs are failures. But tastes change, markets shift and yesterday\u2019s flop might be today\u2019s buried treasure. \u201cA lot of it is awful,\u201d my dad used to say. \u201cBut even the awful work is interesting, significant, and now and again you stumble across something special.\u201d In October 2018, I tagged along on what would turn out to be my father\u2019s last day at work. He was 82 and had suffered a stroke and was functioning at half speed. I have PTSD flashbacks of him leaning precipitously over the platform edge to check for the approach of the uptown train, and hobbling with his stick through the rush-hour crowds at Penn station. My dad loved his job and Sony valued his expertise, but his body was failing and the commute took its toll. He worked until lunch then reached for his coat: he was done. My dad\u2019s work had intrigued me for years. It sounded like a blend of the exotic and the eccentric \u2013 an Indiana Jones expedition for rare vinyl nerds \u2013 and so I took a notepad and Dictaphone along that day. The plan was to write a feature about music archiving but life intervened, as it usually does, and I wound up sticking the material in a drawer, as though it were a flop disco album or a failed Sony soul singer. Revisiting it now, six years later, is strange. Every recording carries the air of a seance, because we are listening to people who are no longer physically there. On the Dictaphone it\u2019s still autumn 2018. I\u2019m in Battery Studios on West 44th Street with my father and his regular co-workers, the archivist Marc Kirkeby and chief engineer Matt Cavaluzzo.

From the overwhelming majority of those who have gathered in the streets and in the parliament to see them passing by, the welcome has been warm and genuine, and republican banners few.</p> \n<p>That particular elephant did also manage to find its way into the reception hall among the guests sipping champagne and trying to capture a sly selfie, albeit less dramatically than the one called Indigenous sovereignty.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown,\u201d Anthony Albanese told the king, adding an oblique signpost to Australia\u2019s unfinished business. \u201cNothing stands still.\u201d</p> \n<p>Only Peter Dutton was game to tackle the nation\u2019s seemingly increasingly tepid breakaway inclinations head on, and then only as fodder for a joke in the presence of a monarch who clearly doesn\u2019t mind one.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe hope your spirits have been lifted by the response that you\u2019ve received so far, yesterday in Sydney, and today at the War Memorial and indeed here in this hall in this eclectic gathering,\u201d Dutton told the king, from the podium.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople have had haircuts, people have shined shoes, suits have been pressed. And that\u2019s just the republicans.\u201d</p> \n<p>Australia\u2019s constitutional future didn\u2019t feature in King Charles\u2019s remarks even obliquely \u2013 a fair indication that he recognises it has all gone a bit off the boil.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, he did lean in to a couple of other issues that have caused domestic political pain in the Antipodes. He acknowledged the \u201cunmistakeable signs of climate change\u201d and the need to confront and not ignore them, praising Australia for \u201ctracking the path towards a better, safer future\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"de8da49e-c1ce-4500-9107-555757239d00\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2lDcSw399QU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And in the minutes before Thorpe made her protest, he also acknowledged what he described as the nation\u2019s \u201clong and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation\u201d. In paying respect to the knowledge of the First Peoples, he wove the two issues together.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is in all our interests to be good stewards of the world and good ancestors to those who come after us,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we are all connected, both with the global community and with all that sustains life. That is the timeless wisdom of Indigenous people throughout the entire world.\u201d</p> \n<p>The \u201chorrors of war, death and needless destruction\u201d prompted the king to also declare that \u201cthis moment in our history requires both ancient and new thinking\u201d.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s certainly the challenge for a monarch dropping in to a faraway, slightly ambivalent corner of his empire, armed with nostalgia, empathy and political optimism as the ties to bind it in place.</p> \n<p>Lidia Thorpe burst that warm bubble on Monday, marching towards the stage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/21/what-is-an-indigenous-treaty-and-how-would-it-work-in-australia\">and yelling for a treaty</a>, as Albanese and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, leaned over to whisper in nearby respective royal ears.</p> \n<p>If Thorpe\u2019s protest does nothing else, it serves to remind that while tradition no longer goes unchallenged in this country, sorting out our identity has a long way to go and will be a lot more uncomfortable than one loud, angry voice interrupting a party.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Karen Middleton is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor</p></li> \n <li><p>This story was updated on 22 October 2024 to add what Lidia Thorpe said during her protest</p></li> \n</ul>",

Perhaps this was why the king and queen and their hosts entered the Great Hall from a door behind the stage and not straight ahead from the foyer, down the centre aisle and right past where Thorpe, dressed in a possum-skin cloak, had taken up an early position at the front of a group of waiting MPs. But making an operational switch was never going to avoid the confrontation altogether, any more than the visit itself can fully erase the sense that Australia\u2019s ties to the monarchy symbolise the nation\u2019s past much more than its future. \u201cYou are not our king, you are not sovereign,\u201d Thorpe shouted as she approached the stage before security officials intervened. \u201cYou committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us - our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. You are a genocidalist. This is not your land. This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king.\u201d As she left the room, she shouted \u201cfuck the colony\u201d. Thorpe\u2019s outburst will probably increase sympathy for the royals among Australians who are ambivalent about the monarchy but believe in at least being polite to guests. From the overwhelming majority of those who have gathered in the streets and in the parliament to see them passing by, the welcome has been warm and genuine, and republican banners few. That particular elephant did also manage to find its way into the reception hall among the guests sipping champagne and trying to capture a sly selfie, albeit less dramatically than the one called Indigenous sovereignty. \u201cYou have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown,\u201d Anthony Albanese told the king, adding an oblique signpost to Australia\u2019s unfinished business. \u201cNothing stands still.\u201d Only Peter Dutton was game to tackle the nation\u2019s seemingly increasingly tepid breakaway inclinations head on, and then only as fodder for a joke in the presence of a monarch who clearly doesn\u2019t mind one. \u201cWe hope your spirits have been lifted by the response that you\u2019ve received so far, yesterday in Sydney, and today at the War Memorial and indeed here in this hall in this eclectic gathering,\u201d Dutton told the king, from the podium. \u201cPeople have had haircuts, people have shined shoes, suits have been pressed. And that\u2019s just the republicans.\u201d Australia\u2019s constitutional future didn\u2019t feature in King Charles\u2019s remarks even obliquely \u2013 a fair indication that he recognises it has all gone a bit off the boil. Nevertheless, he did lean in to a couple of other issues that have caused domestic political pain in the Antipodes. He acknowledged the \u201cunmistakeable signs of climate change\u201d and the need to confront and not ignore them, praising Australia for \u201ctracking the path towards a better, safer future\u201d. And in the minutes before Thorpe made her protest, he also acknowledged what he described as the nation\u2019s \u201clong and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation\u201d. In paying respect to the knowledge of the First Peoples, he wove the two issues together. \u201cIt is in all our interests to be good stewards of the world and good ancestors to those who come after us,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we are all connected, both with the global community and with all that sustains life. That is the timeless wisdom of Indigenous people throughout the entire world.\u201d The \u201chorrors of war, death and needless destruction\u201d prompted the king to also declare that \u201cthis moment in our history requires both ancient and new thinking\u201d. That\u2019s certainly the challenge for a monarch dropping in to a faraway, slightly ambivalent corner of his empire, armed with nostalgia, empathy and political optimism as the ties to bind it in place. Lidia Thorpe burst that warm bubble on Monday, marching towards the stage and yelling for a treaty, as Albanese and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, leaned over to whisper in nearby respective royal ears. If Thorpe\u2019s protest does nothing else, it serves to remind that while tradition no longer goes unchallenged in this country, sorting out our identity has a long way to go and will be a lot more uncomfortable than one loud, angry voice interrupting a party.

Opella will have to pay \u20ac100m penalty if it breaks that promise. Paris-listed Sanofi said it would retain a significant stake in the division but would focus on producing innovative medicines and vaccines. Doliprane is the bestselling drug in France but production in the country became a political hot topic during the coronavirus pandemic, when shortages prompted the government under Emmanuel Macron to invest in production within the country. From Sanofi\u2019s point of view, the deal follows the logic of similar spin-offs by the American drug companies Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer and by Britain\u2019s GSK, which has sold its consumer businesses to concentrate on researching and developing new drugs. Paul Hudson, Sanofi\u2019s British-born chief executive, said: \u201cWe chose the group with the best capabilities and people that would help us enable the long term success of the business.\u201d He said Sanofi also welcomed Bpifrance \u201cas a supporter of Opella\u2019s development journey\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Just before midnight on Boxing Day 2022, police allege, an intruder into a suburban Brisbane home held a serrated knife centimetres from the face of his accomplice, illuminated by the light of a mobile phone. CCTV footage which purportedly captured this interaction could play a role in determining whether a second teenager is convicted of the murder of 41-year-old Emma Lovell, Queensland\u2019s supreme court heard on Monday as the trial began. Such was the high-profile nature of Lovell\u2019s murder that, rather than appearing before a jury, the trial is a judge-only affair. Lovell was allegedly stabbed to death on the lawn outside her North Lakes home, north of Brisbane, after midnight on 27 December 2022 during a home invasion allegedly carried out by two 17-year-old boys. The trial of one of the teens is slated to run until Wednesday. He is facing four charges, including murder and assault occasioning bodily harm, and also cannot legally be named due to his age. He pleaded not guilty to all charges on Monday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Crown prosecutor David Nardone and defence barrister Laura Reece agreed that the issues up for debate at his trial were relatively narrow. That the young man on trial this week entered the Lovell home with the other teenager is not in dispute. Nor is the fact that the young man before court this week \u201ccarried out none of the violence\u201d of that evening himself. But Nardone argued that when the accused was shown that 11.5 centimetre-long blade in the moments after his companion had tested the front door of the Lovell home and found it unlocked, the nature of his offending became dramatically more serious. \u201cIt is from that point in time, at least, that the crown will say that the common intention to steal has developed into a common intention to steal while armed with a knife,\u201d Nardone said. Nardone said a trail of CCTV footage from various properties showed the young men roaming the streets, apparently trying to enter homes and vehicles. Among the cameras that captured their movements were the seven installed in the Lovell home. One above the front door, the prosecutor said, captured the two teenagers peering into the door they had just opened. The door had a Christmas wreath on it. The court heard from Lee Lovell and saw footage of him and his late wife grappling with the two home invaders as the four burst from the front door in a frantic melee. He is shirtless, she in her blue nightie. Lee said he had woken to the sound of one of their two dogs, petitioned off in the back of the house, barking. He said he bolted to the bedroom door and was confronted by one of the intruders. \u201cImmediately it was one male in the doorway, right in front of my face,\u201d he said. Lovell said he was trying to get the strangers out of the house and also to detain them until police arrived. Lovell said he was dragged to the ground and repeatedly kicked in the head and stomach. He didn\u2019t realise he had been stabbed until being treated by paramedics. Nor did he realise his wife had been stabbed until his daughter said she was bleeding. \u201cBy the time I looked back at Emma, I believe she was sitting on the ground with knees up, with her head towards her knees.\u201d Other evidence tabled before the court on Monday included DNA evidence that placed the two teenagers at the Lovell property, items of clothing including the accused\u2019s red cap that was found on the scene, the broken handle of the knife found at the nearby residence where the boys were staying and witness testimony of neighbours. Reece said that audio recording captured by a nearby CCTV would also go to the \u201cheart of the case\u201d and could determine whether her client was guilty of murder or manslaughter. She said that Justice Michael Copley KC might hear the words \u201cI\u2019ll kill you and I\u2019ll kill you too\u201d being said during the fracas, but that he also might hear the words: \u201cnah bra\u201d straight afterwards. \u201cYour honour might think that you also hear the words: \u2018stop, stop, stop, stop, stop\u2019.\u201d The trial continues. -With additional reporting by AAP",

Even though there has been a rise in the number of people making wills since the pandemic, there are still many who have not.</p> <p>Figures from Will Aid show that 56% of people have not made one and, of the 11% that have, the document is out of date. </p> <p>Richard Millar, organiser of Free Wills Month, says people tend to leave the writing of the will on a \u201cto-do list\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an exciting thing. There is obviously an element of thinking about your own mortality which we\u2019re not particularly good at engaging in in the UK,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Hall says the pandemic sparked a rise in the number of people getting wills written or revisiting existing instructions to ensure they still reflect what they want to happen to their money.</p> <p>Peter de Vena Franks, Will Aid\u2019s campaign director, says more than a quarter of people feel that they do not have anything worth leaving, according to its research.</p> <p>But, as he advises, that is not the way to look at it. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about how many assets and what assets you have,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving somebody pass away is a really stressful time anyway, and not knowing what that person wanted in terms of their funeral wishes, their record collection, for instance, and some of their stuff which may not have value, just adds a huge amount of extra stress at what is clearly an awful time.\u201d</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"0ad16ddf-67ac-4539-902f-e73f1fd385a8\" data-type=\"subhead\">What happens without a will?</h2> <p>The rules of intestacy kick in and dictate who benefits from your estate.

      "bodyText": "People have been urged to overcome their fear of their own mortality and prepare a will to avoid losing control of what happens to their assets when they die. Two out of three people either do not have a will, or have one which is out of date, according to research by Will Aid, a charity scheme that allows people to get a will written for free, in exchange for a suggested donation that is divided between a group of charities. Having no up-to-date will risks the possibility that money, property and other assets will end up belonging to the crown which, in the last tax year, took in almost \u00a313m after people died without one and had no one to inherit. Solicitor Nick Hall, a partner at London-based firm Gunnercooke, says that even if you have a family to inherit your money, without a will you lose control, as the law then dictates where it goes. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a boat but no one\u2019s steering it,\u201d he says. The good news is that a \u201cbasic\u201d version can be drawn up for free, or at a low cost, because of initiatives set up to benefit charities which rely heavily on donations made in wills to operate. Why do so many not have one? A will dictates who gets your assets when you die, and not having one can cause significant problems for your family. Even though there has been a rise in the number of people making wills since the pandemic, there are still many who have not. Figures from Will Aid show that 56% of people have not made one and, of the 11% that have, the document is out of date. Richard Millar, organiser of Free Wills Month, says people tend to leave the writing of the will on a \u201cto-do list\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not an exciting thing. There is obviously an element of thinking about your own mortality which we\u2019re not particularly good at engaging in in the UK,\u201d he says. Hall says the pandemic sparked a rise in the number of people getting wills written or revisiting existing instructions to ensure they still reflect what they want to happen to their money. Peter de Vena Franks, Will Aid\u2019s campaign director, says more than a quarter of people feel that they do not have anything worth leaving, according to its research. But, as he advises, that is not the way to look at it. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about how many assets and what assets you have,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving somebody pass away is a really stressful time anyway, and not knowing what that person wanted in terms of their funeral wishes, their record collection, for instance, and some of their stuff which may not have value, just adds a huge amount of extra stress at what is clearly an awful time.\u201d What happens without a will? The rules of intestacy kick in and dictate who benefits from your estate. Only married or civil partners, children of the deceased, and then other relatives, can benefit in these circumstances. Nothing will go to friends or charities. In England and Wales, the surviving husband, wife or civil partner keeps the assets \u2013 including property \u2013 up to the value of \u00a3322,000. The rest is split between them and the deceased\u2019s children. If there is no partner and no children, the estate may be inherited by parents, brothers, sisters and other relatives . If there is no family to pass the money on to, the estate is passed to the crown as bona vacantia, or \u201cownerless assets\u201d. In the last tax year, Treasury solicitor Susanna McGibbon \u2013 the government\u2019s most senior legal official \u2013 reported income of \u00a312.8m from estates where someone died without a will or relatives to inherit the money. The Treasury solicitor deals with cases in England and Wales but not the Duchies of Cornwall (dealt with by lawyers for Prince William) or Lancaster (by the king). Why should I get one now? March, October and November are the three months when you can get a \u201cbasic\u201d will written for free. Some charities, such as Cancer Research UK and the Stroke Association, also run free will-writing services in the hope that people will leave them some money. Free Wills Month runs in March and October and allows people over the age of 55 to have a simple will written through a network of participating solicitors. Millar says that funds from wills make up a very significant part of the operating costs of many charities. \u201cFor some it is as much as three quarters of their income,\u201d he says. Will Aid is in November for anyone over the age of 18. Participating solicitors will write a basic will for a voluntary donation \u2013 a suggested \u00a3100 for a single will or \u00a3180 for a pair of \u201cmirror wills\u201d, which are typically between couples and say the same thing about the assets. Outside the \u201cfree\u201d months you can expect to pay between \u00a3250 and \u00a3350, says Hall. Charities such as Age UK, British Red Cross, Christian Aid, NSPCC, Save the Children, SCIAF and Tr\u00f3caire benefit from the donations. A \u201cbasic\u201d will is one where there are a small number of beneficiaries. It can state who the guardians of any young children would be on the death of their parents, and include donations to charity, says De Vena Franks. What it does not cover is if a trust needs to be set up, or if there is a very substantial estate. But I already have one \u2026 It is important to keep it updated, especially if there is a change in your personal circumstances. This could be is someone who is named in the will dies, if you have children or grandchildren, or if you get married or divorced. Hall says: \u201cIf you get divorced, it doesn\u2019t destroy your will, but it treats your spouse as having died, so the next clause in your will comes in to effect, and that may not be what you want.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For the last few years, Alex Van Halen has been busy writing a book about his beloved brother, Eddie, with the sincere goal of capturing his sibling\u2019s spirit, purging his own sorrow and moving on.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t quite worked out that way. \u201cI\u2019m not done dealing with this yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll probably be dealing with it until my dying day.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, he has been processing his grief, in part, by talking to his departed brother from time to time, including several instances during this very interview. Periodically in our one-hour talk, the 71-year-old drummer addressed his late brother directly, at times to ladle lavish praise on him, at others to curse him to the sky for the self-destructive behavior he believes had a hand in his demise. \u201cThis is probably a spiritually, psychically wrong thing to say,\u201d he said intensely, \u201cbut had Ed listened to our dad, he\u2019d still be here. Instead, he did everything he could to fuck that up.\u201d</p> <p>The lessons Alex alludes to from their dad had much to do with the importance of hard work, the urgency for appreciating life and the necessity of sitting gracefully with the treasures of your talent. Because Alex feels that, in the end, his brother couldn\u2019t live up to the last of those goals, he includes passages in his book, which he titled Brothers, where he angrily confronts his sibling\u2019s spirit with questions such as: \u201cDo you know how lucky we are? Do you know how fortunate you were to be born with a talent? Maybe you never believed you were worthy of your gift and that\u2019s why you were so self-destructive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou want to destroy the thing that\u2019s the most precious to you, so you can stop holding on to it for dear life.\u201d</p> <p>Such passages make Brothers both a highly emotional read and a rich psychological portrait of a family dynamic that, in many ways, defined the lives of both sons. To wit: during the interview Alex mentioned his father nearly a dozen times. \u201cWe owe everything to him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the icon, the one who we respected.\u201d</p>    <p>He was also the one they feared, as well as the one whose own ruinous issues with alcohol informed their own. Small wonder, Brothers winds up telling a far more complex story than its author may even have intended. At once, it\u2019s a story about the power of familial love, the mysteries of genius, via Eddie\u2019s paradigm-shifting approach to the guitar, and the role of the immigrant in America, with all of its related issues of race and class. At the same time, it\u2019s an age-old story of rock\u2018n\u2019roll excess, told with the ribald humor you\u2019d expect from a band that often served as a synonym for \u201cparty\u201d.</p> <p>From the start, the Van Halen brothers were an insular team of outsiders who, through their music, found a way into the culture so deep, it made them one of the most globally successful rock groups of all time. Their parents were outsiders as well, living between cultures. Their father, a Dutch jazz musician, met their mother, who was Indonesian, in her country and married there. Facing prejudices for their interracial marriage, they chose to raise their family in Holland but later immigrated to seek the American dream in its epicenter of aspiration, Los Angeles. At the time, Alex was eight years old, Ed was six. Neither spoke a word of English. Total immersion in the new culture taught them fast, but at school their deficiencies showed. \u201cEvery time we were tested for anything, the low score was always language,\u201d Alex said.</p> <p>Ed took it to heart, believing he was unintelligent. According to Alex, Ed took <em>everything </em>to heart, internalizing any negative feedback either within the family or outside of it, while his older brother let everything roll off his back. Though they were biracial kids, Alex said they didn\u2019t experience much prejudice growing up due to their neighborhood. \u201cIt was Indian, Hispanic, Native American, you name it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur first bass player was Black.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly, their biracial identity never became a topic of conversation even after they became world famous. As outsider kids, they knew the power, as well as the pain, of \u201cpassing\u201d. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mention it, I\u2019m not going to say anything,\u201d Alex said with an ironic laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it works.\u201d</p> <p>At home, the boys had firm roles within the family, with Alex playing the tough protector to sensitive Ed. Due to his role as the elder, Alex had a closer relationship with their father \u2013 something that both irked Ed and brought out his competitive side. Ed also felt condescended to by his mother, whose strict standards caused her to judge her younger son harshly at times. Often, writes Alex, Ed felt \u201clike a nobody\u201d in her eyes, though he knew she loved him deeply. Their mother pushed both kids hard to study music, but from the classical world, which they abhorred, rather than the rock\u2018n\u2019roll one, which they adored. Her zeal for classical music was part of her idealization of \u201crespectable culture\u201d, in hopes of winning \u201cacceptance into the white world\u201d, Alex said. That\u2019s also why, to the last of her days, she viewed Van Halen\u2019s raucous music as \u201ca disgrace\u201d.</p> <p>For the same striving reason, the family always referred to Ed as Edward, a name he used on all the band\u2019s album credits. \u201cHe could not <em>stand </em>to be called \u2018Eddie,\u2019\u201d Alex said.</p> <p>The family was poor, forcing their dad to take several jobs, including at a factory where the teenage Alex also worked. There, he instantly noticed class and race distinctions. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single caucasian person working there,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The portrait Alex paints of his family is loving but rough and tumble, with the men sometimes reacting to each other violently. Still, Alex betrays not a trace of bitterness about even their toughest interactions. In their worship of their dad, the boys imitated his drinking from an early age. \u201cWe were \u2018pros\u2019 by the time we were 13,\u201d Alex said with a lingering trace of a boast.</p>    <p>The low status their parents held in society fired a righteous response in the sons to make it big at all costs. Fired by the music they worshipped, primarily by Cream and Led Zeppelin, they would \u201cplay from the moment we woke up until the moment we went to sleep\u201d, Alex said.</p> <p>Given their unwavering worth ethic, and the mega-success it yielded, the Van Halen story represents the ultimate expression of the immigrant dream. For that reason, Alex said he finds the current political targeting of immigrants \u201coffensive\u201d.</p> <p>As teenagers, the brothers formed Van Halen along with bassist Michael Anthony and singer David Lee Roth. Immediately, nagging differences arose between the music-obsessed brothers and their frontman, who was more drawn to the showy role of entertainer. Though Roth\u2019s clownish behavior often made the brothers cringe, they recognized its commercial power and, so, went along with it. In the book, Alex often disparages Roth\u2019s vocal abilities, saying he could not keep time or, sometimes, sing on key. When they recorded their first album, in 1978, their producer, the legendary Ted Templeman, wanted to fire Roth and replace him with Sammy Hagar. (The latter wound up joining Van Halen after Roth quit in 1985.) That sparked one of many battles the brothers had with Templeman. \u201cHe was looking for the Doobie Brothers,\u201d Alex said. \u201cWe wanted to be more \u2018Led Zeppelin II\u2019. We wanted to improvise. He wanted us to sound just like his haircut \u2013 real tight.\u201d</p> <p>For their debut album, they had to fight to push through Ed\u2019s solo song Eruption, a one-minute-forty-two-second revelation that fired a revolution in guitar technique. The album became a smash but the lousy contract they signed with Warner Bros meant that after a 12-month, hugely successful tour to support it, they owed the company $2m and had to rush back to the studio to help make up for it.</p> <p>Luckily for them, their albums went from strength to strength, sales-wise but, internally, things were coming apart. In the book, Alex barely mentions bassist Anthony. When he does, he praises him more for his backup singing than for his main instrument. Though Alex calls Anthony \u201ca lovely guy, he just wasn\u2019t part of the equation\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Roth\u2019s hogging of the spotlight and insistence on emphasizing the razzle-dazzle over the sound, drove the brothers mad, exacerbated by what they saw as his jealousy for Ed\u2019s status as a creative colossus. More, Ed felt hemmed in by Templeman\u2019s discouragement of his solos and his questioning of even songs like Jump, a No 1 smash that Alex says neither their producer nor Roth thought worthy of recording. There was also tension within each brother between their own tastes (which leaned towards uncompromising acts like Mahavishnu Orchestra and Allan Holdsworth) and their unwavering desire to remain mega-popular. Things came to a head after Ed recorded his iconic solo on Michael Jackson\u2019s Beat It, without telling the others. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing playing on that record?\u201d Alex recalled as his response. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize you only have so many great solos in you? Don\u2019t give one to Michael Jackson!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>According to Alex, Roth used Ed stepping out as an excuse to leave the band. Given how popular the singer had become through the very videos that embarrassed the brothers, it looked like he would have a great career in film and TV, as well as music. But it didn\u2019t work out that way. \u201cHe was delusional,\u201d said the drummer. \u201cHe\u2019s not an actor.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwYN7mTi6HM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SwYN7mTi6HM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Even so, Alex said: \u201cThe spiritual part of the band died when Dave left.\u201d That\u2019s why he ended his book in 1985. Though the band went on to have mega-success with subsequent frontman Hagar, he later wrote a scathing book about his time with them. Reacting to Hagar\u2019s complaints, Alex said: \u201c\u2018Are you really that jealous of Ed? Are you really that scared of him?\u2019 That\u2019s how people act when they try to diminish somebody.\u201d</p> <p>When Ed died, so did Van Halen, though Alex still hopes to find a vehicle for some unreleased music by his brother. His quest provides a useful distraction from his grief. An extra problem he has had in processing it comes from the anger he feels towards his brother for not taking his cancer seriously enough. When Ed was first diagnosed with tongue cancer back in 2000, \u201crather than going to an oncologist, he went to an oral surgeon who used a blade that could fell a tree to cut part of his tongue out,\u201d Alex said. \u201cEd, what the fuck are you thinking?\u201d</p> <p>His brother\u2019s particular reaction to intoxicants, Alex believes, had something to do with his feeling of invincibility. \u201cHe could do more drugs than anybody, and still be in top shape the next day,\u201d Alex said. But \u201cthe very thing that allows you to live that way makes you think \u2018I\u2019m immune from that.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/07/eddie-van-halen-was-the-heir-to-hendrix-electric-guitar\">Eddie Van Halen was the heir to Hendrix, fusing technique with glorious pop</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/07/eddie-van-halen-obituary\">In 2020, Edward Van Halen died</a> at age 65.

      "bodyText": "For the last few years, Alex Van Halen has been busy writing a book about his beloved brother, Eddie, with the sincere goal of capturing his sibling\u2019s spirit, purging his own sorrow and moving on. It hasn\u2019t quite worked out that way. \u201cI\u2019m not done dealing with this yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll probably be dealing with it until my dying day.\u201d In the meantime, he has been processing his grief, in part, by talking to his departed brother from time to time, including several instances during this very interview. Periodically in our one-hour talk, the 71-year-old drummer addressed his late brother directly, at times to ladle lavish praise on him, at others to curse him to the sky for the self-destructive behavior he believes had a hand in his demise. \u201cThis is probably a spiritually, psychically wrong thing to say,\u201d he said intensely, \u201cbut had Ed listened to our dad, he\u2019d still be here. Instead, he did everything he could to fuck that up.\u201d The lessons Alex alludes to from their dad had much to do with the importance of hard work, the urgency for appreciating life and the necessity of sitting gracefully with the treasures of your talent. Because Alex feels that, in the end, his brother couldn\u2019t live up to the last of those goals, he includes passages in his book, which he titled Brothers, where he angrily confronts his sibling\u2019s spirit with questions such as: \u201cDo you know how lucky we are? Do you know how fortunate you were to be born with a talent? Maybe you never believed you were worthy of your gift and that\u2019s why you were so self-destructive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou want to destroy the thing that\u2019s the most precious to you, so you can stop holding on to it for dear life.\u201d Such passages make Brothers both a highly emotional read and a rich psychological portrait of a family dynamic that, in many ways, defined the lives of both sons. To wit: during the interview Alex mentioned his father nearly a dozen times. \u201cWe owe everything to him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the icon, the one who we respected.\u201d He was also the one they feared, as well as the one whose own ruinous issues with alcohol informed their own. Small wonder, Brothers winds up telling a far more complex story than its author may even have intended. At once, it\u2019s a story about the power of familial love, the mysteries of genius, via Eddie\u2019s paradigm-shifting approach to the guitar, and the role of the immigrant in America, with all of its related issues of race and class. At the same time, it\u2019s an age-old story of rock\u2018n\u2019roll excess, told with the ribald humor you\u2019d expect from a band that often served as a synonym for \u201cparty\u201d. From the start, the Van Halen brothers were an insular team of outsiders who, through their music, found a way into the culture so deep, it made them one of the most globally successful rock groups of all time. Their parents were outsiders as well, living between cultures. Their father, a Dutch jazz musician, met their mother, who was Indonesian, in her country and married there. Facing prejudices for their interracial marriage, they chose to raise their family in Holland but later immigrated to seek the American dream in its epicenter of aspiration, Los Angeles. At the time, Alex was eight years old, Ed was six. Neither spoke a word of English. Total immersion in the new culture taught them fast, but at school their deficiencies showed. \u201cEvery time we were tested for anything, the low score was always language,\u201d Alex said. Ed took it to heart, believing he was unintelligent. According to Alex, Ed took everything to heart, internalizing any negative feedback either within the family or outside of it, while his older brother let everything roll off his back. Though they were biracial kids, Alex said they didn\u2019t experience much prejudice growing up due to their neighborhood. \u201cIt was Indian, Hispanic, Native American, you name it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur first bass player was Black.\u201d Interestingly, their biracial identity never became a topic of conversation even after they became world famous. As outsider kids, they knew the power, as well as the pain, of \u201cpassing\u201d. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mention it, I\u2019m not going to say anything,\u201d Alex said with an ironic laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it works.\u201d At home, the boys had firm roles within the family, with Alex playing the tough protector to sensitive Ed. Due to his role as the elder, Alex had a closer relationship with their father \u2013 something that both irked Ed and brought out his competitive side. Ed also felt condescended to by his mother, whose strict standards caused her to judge her younger son harshly at times. Often, writes Alex, Ed felt \u201clike a nobody\u201d in her eyes, though he knew she loved him deeply. Their mother pushed both kids hard to study music, but from the classical world, which they abhorred, rather than the rock\u2018n\u2019roll one, which they adored. Her zeal for classical music was part of her idealization of \u201crespectable culture\u201d, in hopes of winning \u201cacceptance into the white world\u201d, Alex said. That\u2019s also why, to the last of her days, she viewed Van Halen\u2019s raucous music as \u201ca disgrace\u201d. For the same striving reason, the family always referred to Ed as Edward, a name he used on all the band\u2019s album credits. \u201cHe could not stand to be called \u2018Eddie,\u2019\u201d Alex said. The family was poor, forcing their dad to take several jobs, including at a factory where the teenage Alex also worked. There, he instantly noticed class and race distinctions. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single caucasian person working there,\u201d he said. The portrait Alex paints of his family is loving but rough and tumble, with the men sometimes reacting to each other violently. Still, Alex betrays not a trace of bitterness about even their toughest interactions. In their worship of their dad, the boys imitated his drinking from an early age. \u201cWe were \u2018pros\u2019 by the time we were 13,\u201d Alex said with a lingering trace of a boast. The low status their parents held in society fired a righteous response in the sons to make it big at all costs. Fired by the music they worshipped, primarily by Cream and Led Zeppelin, they would \u201cplay from the moment we woke up until the moment we went to sleep\u201d, Alex said. Given their unwavering worth ethic, and the mega-success it yielded, the Van Halen story represents the ultimate expression of the immigrant dream. For that reason, Alex said he finds the current political targeting of immigrants \u201coffensive\u201d. As teenagers, the brothers formed Van Halen along with bassist Michael Anthony and singer David Lee Roth. Immediately, nagging differences arose between the music-obsessed brothers and their frontman, who was more drawn to the showy role of entertainer. Though Roth\u2019s clownish behavior often made the brothers cringe, they recognized its commercial power and, so, went along with it. In the book, Alex often disparages Roth\u2019s vocal abilities, saying he could not keep time or, sometimes, sing on key. When they recorded their first album, in 1978, their producer, the legendary Ted Templeman, wanted to fire Roth and replace him with Sammy Hagar. (The latter wound up joining Van Halen after Roth quit in 1985.) That sparked one of many battles the brothers had with Templeman. \u201cHe was looking for the Doobie Brothers,\u201d Alex said. \u201cWe wanted to be more \u2018Led Zeppelin II\u2019. We wanted to improvise. He wanted us to sound just like his haircut \u2013 real tight.\u201d For their debut album, they had to fight to push through Ed\u2019s solo song Eruption, a one-minute-forty-two-second revelation that fired a revolution in guitar technique. The album became a smash but the lousy contract they signed with Warner Bros meant that after a 12-month, hugely successful tour to support it, they owed the company $2m and had to rush back to the studio to help make up for it. Luckily for them, their albums went from strength to strength, sales-wise but, internally, things were coming apart. In the book, Alex barely mentions bassist Anthony. When he does, he praises him more for his backup singing than for his main instrument. Though Alex calls Anthony \u201ca lovely guy, he just wasn\u2019t part of the equation\u201d, he said. Roth\u2019s hogging of the spotlight and insistence on emphasizing the razzle-dazzle over the sound, drove the brothers mad, exacerbated by what they saw as his jealousy for Ed\u2019s status as a creative colossus. More, Ed felt hemmed in by Templeman\u2019s discouragement of his solos and his questioning of even songs like Jump, a No 1 smash that Alex says neither their producer nor Roth thought worthy of recording. There was also tension within each brother between their own tastes (which leaned towards uncompromising acts like Mahavishnu Orchestra and Allan Holdsworth) and their unwavering desire to remain mega-popular. Things came to a head after Ed recorded his iconic solo on Michael Jackson\u2019s Beat It, without telling the others. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing playing on that record?\u201d Alex recalled as his response. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize you only have so many great solos in you? Don\u2019t give one to Michael Jackson!\u2019\u201d According to Alex, Roth used Ed stepping out as an excuse to leave the band. Given how popular the singer had become through the very videos that embarrassed the brothers, it looked like he would have a great career in film and TV, as well as music. But it didn\u2019t work out that way. \u201cHe was delusional,\u201d said the drummer. \u201cHe\u2019s not an actor.\u201d Even so, Alex said: \u201cThe spiritual part of the band died when Dave left.\u201d That\u2019s why he ended his book in 1985. Though the band went on to have mega-success with subsequent frontman Hagar, he later wrote a scathing book about his time with them. Reacting to Hagar\u2019s complaints, Alex said: \u201c\u2018Are you really that jealous of Ed? Are you really that scared of him?\u2019 That\u2019s how people act when they try to diminish somebody.\u201d When Ed died, so did Van Halen, though Alex still hopes to find a vehicle for some unreleased music by his brother. His quest provides a useful distraction from his grief. An extra problem he has had in processing it comes from the anger he feels towards his brother for not taking his cancer seriously enough. When Ed was first diagnosed with tongue cancer back in 2000, \u201crather than going to an oncologist, he went to an oral surgeon who used a blade that could fell a tree to cut part of his tongue out,\u201d Alex said. \u201cEd, what the fuck are you thinking?\u201d His brother\u2019s particular reaction to intoxicants, Alex believes, had something to do with his feeling of invincibility. \u201cHe could do more drugs than anybody, and still be in top shape the next day,\u201d Alex said. But \u201cthe very thing that allows you to live that way makes you think \u2018I\u2019m immune from that.\u2019\u201d In 2020, Edward Van Halen died at age 65. He was one year younger than his dad was when he succumbed to alcoholism. \u201cThat says it all right there,\u201d Alex said. \u201cEd had to prove something. \u201cMaybe he knew something we didn\u2019t,\u201d Alex said. \u201cMaybe he was just passing through. Ed was an angel in human form.\u201d In the end, that\u2019s what Alex most urgently wants people to know about his brother. It\u2019s also what he holds most dear in order to cope, along with his belief that Ed lives on in some form, as do their mother and father. \u201cThe last person alive has the entire family in him,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if our minuscule brains are capable of seeing it, but they\u2019re there. And I am definitely on the lookout.\u201d Brothers by Alex Van Halen is out on 22 October (HarperCollins Publishers, \u00a322).

Hence, putting gas into the federal scheme \u201cachieves nothing\u201d because such project would never get support. \u201cIt\u2019s just a distraction,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>(His federal counterpart, <strong>Ted O\u2019Brien</strong>, had argued last week: \u201cThe inclusion of gas in the CIS is crucial to addressing the immediate challenges in Australia\u2019s gas market, ensuring reliable electricity supply, and stabilising energy prices.\u201d)</p> \n  <p>Bowen, meanwhile, downplayed reports in the past week or so in the Murdoch tabloids and the AFR about Norway\u2019s <strong>Equinor</strong> pulling out of the running for a proposed offshore windfarm zone near Illawarra. He noted that Equinor had announced its exit from the race back in June (and hence, wondered why it was being repeated). </p> \n  <p>The company was still in the running for a zone planned for the offshore Hunter River, up the NSW coast, and the much larger zone off the Gippsland coast was going \u201cgangbusters\u201d.</p> \n  <p>As we anticipated, that second round of the CIS is only an acceleration (albeit a significant one). The overall size of the scheme will not be expanded, Bowen\u2019s office has confirmed.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, Bowen hinted the government won\u2019t be releasing its 2035 emissions targets this side of the election. He would be taking advice from the <strong>Climate Change Authority</strong> (now chaired by <strong>Matt Kean</strong>, the former NSW treasurer and energy minister in a Liberal-led coalition).</p> \n  <p>No nation had yet lodged 2035 carbon cuts to the UN body (the UNFCCC), Bowen noted.

The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has defended the housing plan to rezone affluent areas. And stamp duty for off-the-plan homes is being slashed in a stimulus bid. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government will accelerate the pace of an auction system that helps underwrite the rollout of renewables. Sydney\u2019s Entertainment Quarter at Moore Park is set for redevelopment, with the state government opening a tender process for its long-term lease. Qantas was ordered to pay $170,000 to three workers illegally sacked at start of pandemic. The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, registered the purchase of a plane. Hephner the alpaca met King Charles at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. A man was arrested outside the Australian War Memorial, where King Charles and Queen Camilla were visiting earlier. Senator Lidia Thorpe turned her back on King Charles and Queen Camilla as they stood to attention for the national anthem at a parliamentary reception in Canberra. Thorpe was then removed from the reception after yelling \u201cyou stole from us\u201d at king. Thorpe said she had intended to hand the king \u201ca notice of complicity in genocide\u201d. The Australian Monarchist League demanded Thorpe\u2019s resignation after her \u201cfailed attempt to disrupt His Majesty the King\u201d at Parliament House this afternoon. The live news blog will be back tomorrow morning. Charles marvels at rainforest gully in botanic gardens In their last formal event in Canberra during this visit at the Australian National Botanic Gardens, King Charles walked down a path of rocky stairs into the rainforest gully with the head of the gardens, Dr Rebecca Pirzl. He held tightly to the rail and at the bottom of the steep stairs, paused touching a large tree and looked up into its canopy. As Queen Camilla made her way down the steps cautiously in her heels, the king told Pirzl \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary\u201d while looking down the gully, which features plants from the diverse rainforests from Tasmania to Queensland. The king and queen walked along the lower boardwalk in the gully, Charles initially striding off quickly before Camilla called to him to slow down. They paused for photos before making their way up more rocky steps to the tree planting location. The Liberal candidate for Pittwater, Georgia Ryburn, has conceded the NSW state electorate to the independent candidate, Jacqui Scruby. Ryburn was not expected to win Saturday\u2019s byelection by the time counting finished on the night, and this afternoon said she had called Scruby to congratulate her. In a post on her Instagram account, Ryburn said: I have just called Jacqui Scruby to concede and congratulate her. I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t extremely disappointed. This wasn\u2019t the outcome I had hoped for, but I know this isn\u2019t the end of the road. I am extremely grateful to be your Liberal candidate for Pittwater, and am humbled by the amazing support from the Pittwater community and the Liberal party. Ryburn\u2019s career as deputy mayor of the Northern Beaches council was cut short by her party\u2019s failure to lodge the paperwork to nominate more than a third of its candidates for the recent local government elections. The Climate 200-backed Scruby secured a historic 22% swing against the Liberal party when she ran for Pittwater at the 2023 state election. She lost by only 606 votes to the Liberals\u2019 Rory Amon, who triggered the byelection when he resigned less than halfway through his first term as Pittwater MP. Amon quit NSW parliament after being charged in August with 10 child sexual assault offences. He has denied all charges. King and queen plant snow gums King Charles and Queen Camilla each took part in the royal tradition of planting a tree in Canberra today. The governor general escorted the king and queen for the ceremony which took place in the grounds of Government House where they met the horticultural coordinator Glenn Huender and senior horticulturist Chris Mansfield, and planted Eucalyptus pauciflora \u2013 also know as snow gum trees. Schoolchildren from Wamberal public school had travelled for four hours to see the tree planting and student Imogen Kimble was on hand to help the king plant his tree. The king asked Huender about the composting for the soil, which was all done on site. The royals then went over to talk to the schoolchildren who were very excited to have the chance to meet them. The domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty, award-winning author of See What You Made Me Do, Jess Hill, professor of domestic and family violence at the University of Technology Sydney, Dr Anne Summers, and executive general manager, inclusion and social policy, at the Australian Football League, Tanya Hosch, were among a powerful group of advocates, experts and survivors who joined Queen Camilla today for a roundtable discussion about the epidemic of domestic violence gripping Australia. During the discussion the Queen heard from key sector experts as well as women with lived experience about the measures being implemented to try to end violence against women in Australia. Hosch said sport had an important role to play: One in 20 is a paid member of the AFL sporting code. There is a lot of work to be done. Camilla asked: Are these women prepared to come forward and talk? Do Indigenous people feel able to come forward? The governor gerneral, Sam Mostyn, said: Aboriginal women had fallen out of the system. There are hundreds of women over decades whose experiences are not recorded. Katie Kiss, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner, talked to the queen about children being removed from their families. While Hill discussed the pervasiveness of coercive control: Perpetrators all study from the same handbook. It is terribly difficult to prove. Twenty-one-year-old Conor Pall from Mildura, Victoria was the sole male around the table. As a children\u2019s author and advocate, Pall represents the rights of young people affected by family violence. He knows from personal experience how the voices of child victims are rarely heard in the justice system and is determined to use his lived experience as a male survivor to drive change. Before the roundtable Battie said it was \u201cgreat\u201d that the queen was using the tour to raise awareness of the issue. King surveys flora, meets Andrew Forrest and talks sport at botanic gardens King Charles was led on a detailed tour of the Banksia Gardens at Canberra\u2019s National Botanic Gardens by Beverly Ardler and Kain Ardler from the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community, as well as Botanic Gardens head Dr Rebecca Pirzl. Wearing dark glasses in the hot Australian sun, the king moved slowly through the display of the iconic Australian plants, asking questions and pointing out particularly interesting examples. The Ardlers explained about the significance of banksia species to their community and how bushfires affected local ecosystems. The botanic gardens\u2019 display is the largest collection of Australian plants in the world. The king was met at the entrance to the Banksia Gardens by Australian mining mandate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest, with whom he spoke at length. On his way out, he was met by students from Ainslie School. Leo Turner, 12, asked the king if he\u2019d heard of AFL. The king replied: Yes, I\u2019ve heard of it. Leo asked: What\u2019s your favourite sport? The king replied (before saying goodbye): I can\u2019t do much now. Too many injuries. I used to sit on a horse. More in-home support needed for people \u2018traumatised through institutions\u2019 Back to the Senate community affairs committee hearing on the new aged care bill, the Department of Health and Aged Care says more support for in-home care is needed for all Australians who\u2019ve been traumatised through institutions. Andrea Kelly from the department was speaking about the wish of many First Nations elders to stay on country. Kelly said she had conducted more than 135 consultations and met with around 1,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as well as peak bodies and providers around issues of cultural safety. Kelly said: People want to stay at home, they don\u2019t want to go into residential aged care, and that\u2019s particularly true for Stolen Generation survivors, veterans and members of the LGBQTI community that I\u2019ve met with. Kelly agreed that greater in-home supports would need to be provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, and other Australians who had experienced sexual child abuse. While my conversations have been specific with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, I think that model of care we need to think about for all Australians who\u2019ve been traumatised through institutions. King watches \u2018bushfire\u2019 during CSIRO lab visit King Charles has toured the CSIRO\u2019s National Bushfire Behaviour Research Laboratory, where he viewed a \u201cPyrotron\u201d demonstration. The seven-minute demonstration replicated a bushfire in a 29-metre-long combustion wind tunnel. The experiment is used to better understand bushfire behaviour and effective methods to suppress it, senior research scientist Matt Plucinski said. The king was invited to start the experiment as he met with researchers and CSIRO head Doug Hilton, receiving a briefing about how quickly the fires could spread. The eucalyptus smoke was \u201cthe smell of science\u201d, Hilton joked with the king. Outside, an ACT Rural Fire Service engine doused itself during a \u201cburn over drill\u201d, demonstrating how firefighters stuck in the truck in the middle of a fire storm would survive the worst of the blistering inferno. The king was introduced to five volunteer firefighters before they started the drill, forcing him to take a slight step back as he was sprayed with a light mist due to the breeze. He told reporters as he left the site after the drill: It was very encouraging to see what they can do. He asked the firefighters about the differences between bushfires in the northern and southern hemispheres, including comparisons with Canada. It was King Charles\u2019 second visit to a CSIRO Canberra site, the first being February 1966, when the young prince toured the wildlife research division. Multiple arrests during king\u2019s ACT visit ACT police made multiple arrests in Canberra in relation to the visit of King Charles today. About 11am a 62-year-old man was arrested at the Australian War Memorial for breach of the peace. He was taken to the ACT watch house, where he signed an undertaking to keep the peace and was released without charge, police said. A second arrest was made about 11.30am, when police arrested a 21-year-old woman for failing to comply with a police direction, police said. She was charged and she faced ACT magistrates court this afternoon. Police said \u201cseveral\u201d other arrests were made at the Australian War Memorial \u2013 those people were later released without charge. In relation to an \u201cinteraction\u201d with Senator Lidia Thorpe at the memorial, police said: This morning, police spoke to a protest group near the Australian War Memorial. The group was directed to move on from the area and they complied with that direction. No arrests were made and police consider the matter finalised. One-hour cap on household services for older people is due to budget, official says Back to the Senate community affairs committee hearing, where the Department of Health and Aged Care has affirmed the goal of the new aged care bill will be to have people ageing at home for longer. Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne has raised why there is a one-hour cap on services to help older people clean their houses, including gardening, which was raised as a serious issue \u2013 alongside the lack of gardening services \u2013 preventing people staying at home longer. Allman-Payne gave the example of older renters being subject to eviction because of their inability to maintain the garden to a standard the landlord deems acceptable. Nick Morgan, from the department, said there was a one-hour cap on household services because of the need to retain budget for personal care and clinical services. Queensland LNP candidate says sorry for Nazi joke Queensland LNP candidate Bree James has apologised for making a Nazi joke in a Facebook post. On Saturday, the Barron River candidate posted an image of herself beside an election banner which had been vandalised with a spray painted moustache in the style of Adolf Hitler. \u201cEven the banner is getting in the spirit and celebrating my German heritage\u201d, she said, in the post advertising the city\u2019s German festival. She apologised on the weekend, and again on Monday when Labor\u2019s campaign bus visited her pre-poll booth. James reportedly told the cameras the post was a joke in poor taste that she had apologised for \u201cand I hope people can forgive me\u201d. On Monday, Labor opponent Craig Crawford said James is \u201cunfit for office\u201d. Bree James is unfit for office, and people should not be voting for her in the upcoming election. David Crisafulli should have cut her then and then. I\u2019m pretty sure that if I had done something stupid like that, I certainly would have offered my position up to the premier. LNP leader David Crisafulli said on Monday that he\u2019d spoken to his candidate and \u201cI\u2019ve expressed my view to her very clearly. \u201cIs this acceptable? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s disappointing, it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s not funny\u201d, he said. The Australian Monarchist League is demanding the resignation of Senator Lidia Thorpe after her \u201cfailed attempt to disrupt His Majesty the King\u201d at Parliament House this afternoon. In a statement, the league\u2019s national chairman, Philip Benwell, said: Senator Thorpe should step down with immediate effect. The Australian Monarchist League unequivocally condemns the ill-considered behaviour of this isolated senator. Her childish demonstration has done nothing to diminish the gratitude and pride that millions of Australians have for our country, its history, its peoples and its sound system of governance. In fact, it has likely only strengthened these feelings. Should she not resign, the league is calling for Thorpe\u2019s \u201cmisconduct\u201d to be addressed \u201cin accordance with what is the obvious and prevailing public sentiment.\u201d Albanese\u2019s $4.3m home buy not a good look, ex-Tory MP says Rory Stewart, former Tory MP and co-host of the The Rest is News podcast, says Anthony Albanese\u2019s purchase of a multimillion-dollar home on the New South Wales Central Coast \u201cdoesn\u2019t look great\u201d. \u201cThe idea of buying luxury mansions doesn\u2019t look great when you\u2019re a leftwing leader,\u201d he told David Speers, host of ABC Insiders, in an interviewed aired on Afternoon Briefing. Keir Starmer\u2019s popularity ratings are tanking because he\u2019s getting wealthy donors to buy him fancy spectacles and clothes for his wife. And Boris Johnson was not helped by having or putting \u00a3100,000 wallpaper on his walls. David Cameron understood this and deliberately cut his salary when he came in as prime minister ... travelled on EasyJet. When asked if it is fair to say voters don\u2019t like to see their prime ministers getting anything, other than being paid, he said: That\u2019s true, and as a working politician, I often was resentful of that. I remember that there were times when I felt like saying to voters: \u2018Listen, it would be better if we returned if you like to the British parliament of the early 20th century where MPs didn\u2019t receive salaries and we\u2019ll just work for free for you!\u2019 But, of course, there are problems with doing that too. When asked whether the coarseness of Trumpian politics were permeating the political culture in the Anglosphere, he said he had noticed the \u201cdead cat strategy\u201d in effect: Which is \u2013 if somebody is focusing on some scandal, something that you\u2019ve got wrong, you just slap a dead cat on the table and move on. Senator Lidia Thorpe has released a statement following her remarks to the king in Parliament House this afternoon. She said she intended to hand \u201ca notice of complicity in the genocide of the First Peoples of this county\u201d to King Charles. The senator\u2019s uncle, Robert Thorpe, issued the same notice to the international criminal court on 13 October, according to the statement. She said: Today I intended to hand King Charles a notice of complicity in the genocide of the First Peoples of this county. Krauatungalung elder, Uncle Robbie Thorpe, issued this notice to the international criminal court on October 13 this year, requesting King Charles be charged and prosecuted for genocide. The visit by the so-called king should be an occasion of truth-telling about the true history of this country. The colonial state has been built on the continuing genocide on First Peoples. Today I was silenced and removed from the parliamentary reception when pointing out that the Crown stole from First Peoples. The truth is, this colony is built on stolen land, stolen wealth and stolen lives. The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the First Peoples of this country. These crimes include war crimes, crimes against humanity and failure to prevent genocide. There has been no justice for these crimes. The Crown must be held accountable. Today, the AFP threatened to arrest me for wearing a T-shirt that said \u2018Stolen Land, Stolen Lives, Stolen Wealth\u2019. I was at a rally to call out the crimes committed by the Crown. This is a clear attack on free speech and expression, at the war memorial of all places. Sovereign elder Uncle Coco was arrested by AFP today for peacefully standing up against the genocide on his people and all First Peoples of this continent. This colonial government will punish our elders for protesting against a genocide but refuse to hold the perpetrators to account. Today we call for justice, an end to this ongoing genocide, for treaty and a republic. We want to be able to live in peace and finally come together as a nation. \u2018Spectrum of supported decision-making\u2019 in new aged care bill, department says Older Australians will be supported to make decisions for themselves for as long as possible under the new aged care bill, the Department of Health and Aged Care said this afternoon when answering questions from the Senate standing committee on community affairs on the bill. Mel Metz, the assistant secretary of the legislative reform branch in the department, said \u2013 after peak bodies representing older people advocated strongly for including supported decision-making arrangements in the bill \u2013 that the model on which the framework was based came from an Australian Law Reform Commission report as well as more recent endorsement through the disability royal commission. Supported decision-making recognises capacity to make decision is not black and white, and it exists on a spectrum and can fluctuate, and that\u2019s especially true in aged care for people with dementia. What supported decision-making means is that rather than substituting a new decision-maker when a person\u2019s decision-making capacity diminishes, people are supported to make decisions for themselves for as long as possible. There\u2019s a single concept of supporter rather than a dual representative and supporter framework in the bill \u2013 recognising that capacity isn\u2019t static and that a person might need different levels of assistance day to day. Drawing on state and territory arrangements in place, \u201cthere is a substitute decision-making in the bill \u2013 but that\u2019s at the very end of that spectrum of supported decision-making for people who absolutely cannot make decisions even with support\u201d. Thorpe\u2019s behaviour \u2018alienated a lot of people\u2019 \u2013 Labor MP Over to Afternoon Briefing, where \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the king and queen are on the agenda. Speaking with the ABC, the assistant minister to the prime minister, Patrick Gorman, who is responsible for much of the planning behind the king\u2019s whistle-stop tour, commented on Lidia Thorpe\u2019s remarks shouted to the king at the state reception in Parliament House\u2019s Great Hall. I thought that behaviour was pretty inappropriate. I think that it alienated a lot of people. And I think most of the Australian public expect that their members and senators behave with dignity, especially at these formal state occasions. I can\u2019t speak for the Senate, they are in charge of their own members and their own disciplinary procedures. What I hope is that this doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that it was an incredibly warm reception for the king and the queen. There was clearly a lot of people in the room who were really honoured to have been invited to that very special occasion. As you said, the first time that we\u2019ve had a king of Australia in fact visit Australia, and what we saw in the king\u2019s remarks were his warm affection for this country \u2013 a country that he came here as a student. He\u2019s visited 17 times. And I think that he really went out of his way, not just to talk about the causes that were important to him, such as climate change, but also to talk about his great appreciation of the respect that First Nations Australians have shown him on those visits. King\u2019s visit \u2018difficult for many First Nations people\u2019, Greens senator says Greens senator Dorinda Cox says the visit of King Charles III is a reminder of colonialism\u2019s \u201charrowing injustices\u201d. The Yamatji-Noongar woman said on Monday \u2013 before Senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s comments disrupted a state reception in Canberra \u2013 that the federal Truth and Justice Commission Bill, introduced by the Greens, would allow for First Nations-led, trauma-informed truth telling to fully implement all pillars of the Uluru statement from the heart. In a statement, Cox said: This visit will be difficult for many First Nations people, who still feel the injustice every day of colonialism, especially our stolen generations, which are perpetuated through systemic and structural racism and discrimination. Visiting memorials and attending charity events is not changing the harrowing injustices and ongoing unacceptable rates of deaths of our people in Australia. First Nations justice, truth telling and healing needs to be a priority. The king should be clear in his recognition and support of this. He now needs to be on the right side of history. We need the Labor government to have clear instructions from their sovereign head that we can\u2019t continue on this path if we want peace and healing, this comes with accepting responsibility for the role, actions and destructive impacts of the Crown. Cox went on to say: I invite the king to reflect on this and that sovereignty that was never ceded. There is trauma and grief for First Nations people. He needs to hear this and acknowledge it. The commonwealth has nothing to fear from this formal recognition. First Nations communities continue to feel the impact of policies rooted in colonial attitudes \u2013 such as forced removals, land and resources theft, and systemic discrimination \u2013 that has left deep scars that we need to heal from. We cannot do this without truth telling and truth listening. The time is now. It\u2019s time to respect our inherent, sovereign right to self-determination, including the protection and preservation of our lands and waters \u2013 under our custodianship. Ensuring Australia\u2019s First Peoples are consulted in every vital decision about our shared future. Watt welcomes compensation ruling on illegal Qantas sackings The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, has welcomed the federal court decision for Qantas to compensate workers found to be illegally sacked during the pandemic. In a post to X, Watt wrote: I congratulate [the Transport Workers Union] for pursuing this case in the Federal Court. I also congratulate Qantas\u2019 new management team for taking a more cooperative approach to workplace relations, which is delivering for the company and its workers alike. Tony Abbott says \u2018unfortunate political exhibitionism\u2019 from Lidia Thorpe Former prime minister Tony Abbott, who attended the event, expressed his dismay at Lidia Thorpe\u2019s remarks to the King in the Great Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate political exhibitionism, that\u2019s all I\u2019d say,\u201d he said after the event. Another guest, businessman Dick Smith, said the disruption was an aspect of Australian democracy. I think that\u2019s the wonderful part of our democracy \u2013 that she\u2019s not going to be put in jail. Smith has known the king for many years, including a meeting in 1982 when Smith landed his helicopter on the grounds of Balmoral Castle in the UK. Sewage theory investigated after Sydney beach tar balls The sewage theory floated as an explanation for the \u201ctar balls\u201d that closed eastern Sydney beaches last week has not been ruled out by the lead agency investigating the source of the pollution. In a statement this afternoon, a spokesperson for NSW Maritime said: Investigations are continuing, with a number of samples still being tested by the NSW Environment Protection Authority. An update will be provided once the origin is definitively known. On Friday, Jon Beves, a chemistry expert from University of New South Wales who is part of a team of scientists analysing the debris, told Guardian Australia the \u201cmost logical answer\u201d was that the balls were formed from crude oil. However, he said the balls also contained other greasy materials including fatty acids which meant they potentially had come from a sewage outflow instead of an oil spill or leak off the coast. Later that same day, the NSW Maritime executive director, Mark Hutchings, said: Based on advice from the EPA, we can now confirm the balls are made up of fatty acids, chemicals consistent with those found in cleaning and cosmetic products, mixed with some fuel oil. They are not harmful when on the ground, but should not be touched or picked up. Thank you, Emily Wind. Let\u2019s get on with the rest of the day\u2019s breaking news. Over in Canberra, our team has pieced together the full transcript of senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s remarks to King Charles at a state reception in the Great Hall at Parliament House a short time ago: You are not our king. You are not sovereign. You are not our king. You are not sovereign. You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us \u2013 our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. You are a genocidalist. This is not your land. This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king. Fuck the colony. Fuck the colony. Fuck the colony. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Daisy Dumas will be with you for the next little while. Take care. Here\u2019s another angle of Lidia Thorpe\u2019s protest in parliament house earlier this afternoon, where she shouted following King Charles\u2019 speech: \u2018Offensive graffiti\u2019 in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs investigated NSW police have released CCTV footage after multiple structures were graffitied across Sydney overnight. Police said officers located \u201coffensive graffiti\u201d on the walls of multiple structures in Bronte, Tamarama and Bondi beaches late last night. Photographs sent to 2GB\u2019s Ben Fordham show the word \u201cHamas\u201d graffitied. Police said an investigation has commenced, and investigators had released images of a man they believed might be able to assist with inquiries. He is depicted wearing a grey long-sleeve shirt, black jeans, white/grey shoes, a grey beanie and blue face mask. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Greens say they will \u2018keep fighting\u2019 for republic Earlier today, deputy Greens leader Mehreen Faruqi issued a statement ahead of the parliamentary reception for King Charles and said the party would \u201ckeep fighting\u201d for a republic. In the statement, Faruqi said: The truth is, racism and colonialism are intertwined; and the monarchy symbolises an era that should be left behind for good, not celebrated. Preserving the British monarchy is to preserve white supremacy and the systemic racist structures that were built by the empire and persist today. It\u2019s time for Australia to embrace a republic rooted in decolonisation and sovereignty for First Nations \u2013 a crucial step towards racial justice, truth telling and treaty. RBA says it is not \u2018data obsessed\u2019 Andrew Hauser, the Reserve Bank\u2019s deputy governor, has conceded that the strength of Australia\u2019s labour market in September had been \u201csurprising\u201d, or so he told a CBA global markets conference in Sydney today. As you may recall, the jobless rate actually edged lower to 4.1% (from what had previously been reported by the Bureau of Statistics as 4.2% for August), with an addition of about 62,000 jobs. Markets had already been tilting towards an interest cut NOT landing until February and now they are pricing in that first reduction as most likely next April. (April Fool\u2019s Day, as it happens.) Hauser, though, made it clear that the RBA was also not \u201cdata obsessed\u201d, with the jobs figures just part of the wider \u201ccontext\u201d the board will consider. As we\u2019ve noted in this blog previously, the September quarter inflation figures will land on 30 October, and most of the other data points (including the monthly CPI figures) are basically noise. We also asked Hauser about China, particularly in light of the latest effort to stoke growth, namely today\u2019s cuts in official interest rates. He said: What happens in China matters for us, both in terms of our export growth and in terms of our investments, and so, you know, we are watching it closely. He didn\u2019t say whether he thought the Chinese rate cuts would work, along with the barrage of other stimulatory efforts. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible to tell different stories about the outlook for China\u201d, ranging from the pessimistic to the more optimistic. In a nod to his next speech \u2013 about the importance to Australia\u2019s fortunes that international markets remain open \u2013 Hausers said: Trends in the Australian economy [were] very often shaped by events outside of Australia. The RBA board next meets on 4-5 November, wrapping up just as the US population goes to the polls \u2013 another overseas event that could play a big bearing not just on Australia but just about everywhere else. Earlier today, Lidia Thorpe issued a statement calling for a \u201ctreaty republic\u201d. She said that Australia had \u201cunfinished business that we need to resolve before this country can become a republic\u201d \u2013 and that this \u201cmust happen through treaty\u201d. You can read more of what she said earlier in the blog, here. Here is the moment that independent senator Lidia Thorpe shouted after King Charles\u2019 speech in Parliament House just earlier. As Sarah Basford Canales notes, Thorpe can be heard saying: This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king. More from Australia\u2019s privacy commissioner on AI Continuing from our last post: Some companies have updated their terms since the arrival of large-language-model AI systems to say that personal data will be used unless users opt out, and in some cases this has only been picked up by users of the platform delving into the terms and sharing that information with other users. Carly Kind said only updating the policy wasn\u2019t sufficient: Just updating a privacy policy will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act, in which entities have to be able to establish that it\u2019s within users\u2019 reasonable expectations that their personal information will be used in a different way. And so I think that\u2019s the relevant test that entities need to turn their mind to. If you don\u2019t have consent to use that information in a different way, then you need to be able to show it within users\u2019 reasonable expectations. Privacy watchdog issues AI warning over people\u2019s data Australia\u2019s privacy commissioner, Carly Kind, has warned companies that bury how they\u2019ll use AI on people\u2019s data they have collected risk being investigated by her office. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner released new guidelines for both developers of AI systems and the organisations that use those systems on how personal information should be used. Kind told Guardian Australia: We think that this guidance will hopefully set out pretty clearly how they need to be thinking about that when it comes to larger players and the developments of developers of these models. We\u2019re articulating the legal situation we would have imagined that they had also given consideration to, these laws in the development of these models. We would expect to see compliance with the Privacy Act in instances where the Privacy Act applies, and it does apply to some overseas entities. And then it will be a matter for my office to consider whether to take enforcement action if we do have a sufficient suspicion to suspect non-compliance. King \u2018doing an amazing job\u2019, longtime fan says Earlier, Elaine Hoskins spoke of the moment she got to shake Queen Camilla\u2019s hand at the Australian War Memorial. Camilla is wonderful. Always the lady, and she is such a supporter to him, and it was a privilege to talk to her today. Hoskins drove up from Melbourne with her husband, Russell Baker, to get a glimpse of the royals. But it wasn\u2019t her first time travelling afar to see the British monarchy. Donning a tiara, Hoskins said she was a fan of King Charles III since she was 12. Charles and I are the same age, yes, and so he was my pin-up boy on my wall from when I was about 12. He came to the throne through sadness, but as he is now, I think he\u2019s doing an amazing job. Hoskins went to King Charles\u2019 coronation in England, where she picked up the flag she brought to Canberra. As for Baker, does he share his wife\u2019s love for the British monarchy too? Oh yeah, but she is an absolute monarchist. She\u2019s just mad [about the royals] ... I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m a royalist more than anything \u2013 I don\u2019t think we should be a republic. The independent senator Lidia Thorpe has been removed from a parliamentary reception for King Charles and Queen Camilla after yelling \u201cthis is not your country\u201d and \u201cyou are not my king\u201d and \u201cfuck the colony\u201d. After King Charles concluded his speech, Thorpe walked up the aisle towards the stage, yelling at the royal couple. \u201cYou stole from us,\u201d she shouted, as officials stepped forward to stop her reaching the stage. \u2026 You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. As security officers escorted Thorpe back to the door, she shouted: This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king. As she left the hall and was forced back into the foyer she could be heard shouting: \u201cFuck the colony.\u201d Wrap-up of Albanese and Dutton\u2019s speeches Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton welcomed King Charles and Queen Camilla to Parliament House with warm greetings and a few jokes, thanking them for standing with Australians in good times and bad. Albanese called it honour of his life to have led the Australian delegation attending the king\u2019s coronation. Albanese praised the king\u2019s engagement on issues including climate change and reconciliation. You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times where we\u2019ve debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the Crown. Nothing stands still. Dutton also welcomed the royal couple and lightened the mood, noting how much those gathered had been anticipating the visit. \u201cPeople have had haircuts, people have shined shoes \u2013 and that\u2019s just the republicans,\u201d Dutton said, drawing laughter around the room. King\u2019s speech ends with heckles The king has finished his speech with applause heard across the room, but a heckler can be heard from the crowd: You are not out king \u2026 Give us our land back \u2026 You destroyed our land \u2026 We want treaty. Today\u2019s global challenges require \u2018both ancient and new thinking\u2019 \u2013 king King Charles said that with Covid-19 \u201cbarely behind us\u201d, the impacts of climate change \u201cdeepening\u201d and the \u201chorrors of war, death and needless destruction all too visible\u201d, this moment in history \u201crequires both ancient and new thinking\u201d. The challenges we now face call us to show not only constancy and valour but also humanity, empathy and generosity of spirit. Looking out across the global commonwealth of nations, I see a family of some 2.5 billion people striving for peace, justice and mutual respect. The commonwealth spans six continents and as a group has the size and influence to play a significant role on the global stage, while being small enough to nurture a personal relationship. It has the diversity to understand the world\u2019s problems, and the sheer brain power and resolve to formulate practical solutions. King says Australia \u2018particularly vulnerable\u2019 to climate change King Charles noted the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20, the floods of 2022-23 and the tropical cyclones last year and this year, and spoke of the importance of addressing climate change. I cannot tell you how much I have felt grief and shock of what you have gone, through having visited many of the communities myself over all of these years. Amid such overwhelming challenges, I have always been deeply impressed by the extraordinary bravery and resilience of those who look up, look out and \u2013 in that most Australian way \u2013 battle on \u2026 The regular roll of unprecedented events is an unmistaken sign of climate change, to which Australia is so particularly vulnerable. The king said that Australia\u2019s \u201cinternational leadership on global initiatives to protect our climate and biodiversity is of such absolute and critical importance\u201d. Australia has all of the natural ingredients to create a more sustainable, regenerative way of living, by harnessing the power with which nature has endowed the nation. Whether it be wind or its famous sunshine, Australia is tracking the path towards a better and safer future. King recalls attending Victorian school in 60s King Charles is speaking about his first visit to Australia in 1966 for school in Victoria \u2013 \u201cand, ladies and gentlemen, what an education it was!\u201d I had thought that the school I had been attending in Scotland was remote and testing enough, but nothing had quite prepared me for the realities of the bush country around Mount Bulla. Six decades since his first visit, the king said he was \u201cwitnessed both continuity and great change.\u201d It is worth reflecting that Australia\u2019s unique character has endured and also evolved, and that Australia has become a stronger nation as a result of becoming one of the most multicultural on Earth. King notes Australia\u2019s \u2018long and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation\u2019 King Charles III is now addressing the crowd at the parliamentary reception, saying he is \u201cenormously touched\u201d by the welcome. Let me also say how deeply I appreciated this morning\u2019s moving Welcome to Country ceremony, which offers me the opportunity to pay my respects to the traditional owners of the lands on which we meet \u2013 the Ngunnawal people and all First Nations peoples who have loved and cared for this continent for 65,000 years. In my many visits to Australia, I have witnessed the courage and hope that have guided the nation\u2019s long and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation. Throughout my life, Australia\u2019s First Nations peoples have done me the great honour of sharing so generously their stories and cultures. I can only say how much my own experience has been shaped and strengthened by such tradition and wisdom. Dutton says Australia should \u2018never take British inheritance for granted\u2019 Peter Dutton told King Charles that his presence \u201creminds Australians of all of the things that we love about Britain\u201d \u2013 as well as \u201cour great British heritage\u201d. Representative democracy, the constitution, the separation of powers, the rule of law, the English language, freedom of speech, of association of the press, and so much more besides. We should never take our British inheritance for granted. Australia has benefited from the stability of a democracy with the monarchy as our bedrock. Through times of peace and war, constitutional and parliamentary crises, good times and bad \u2013 Australians have known stability and have taken confidence knowing that there are better days ahead, because our institutions are protected and underpinned by the independence and stoicism of the reigning monarch. Peter Dutton is now addressing the crowd at the parliamentary reception. The opposition leader took a moment to send his well wishes to Princess Catherine: Upon your return home, your majesties, I know that you will convey Australia\u2019s well wishes to the Princess of Wales. \u2018The commonwealth is family\u2019 \u2013 PM Anthony Albanese has noted \u201cdecades of change\u201d in Australia, stating that \u201cbonds of respect and affection\u201d have endured. He told King Charles during the address: The Australia you first knew has grown and evolved in so many ways. Our communities have been strengthened and enriched from people drawn from every culture [and] background \u2026 As a modern, outward-looking economy, we found our place in the world and made our home in the region. We\u2019ve gained a deeper and truer understanding of our national story. Yet through these decades of change, our bonds of respect and affection have matured and they have endured \u2026 For Australia, the commonwealth is family. And, as with any family, we appreciate our differences \u2026 We know the institution is secure in your hands, and we know your commitment to peace and stability will act as your guide during the challenging times in which we find ourselves. PM says king has \u2018long apprehended the grave reality of climate change\u2019 Anthony Albanese is now speaking at the parliamentary reception. The prime minister told King Charles that as king, he has \u201can extraordinary duty to the traditions so carefully upheld, protected and generations of your forbearers, not least your mother, Queen Elizabeth II\u201d. He noted the king\u2019s work towards addressing climate change, and said: Your abiding duty to all that has been built on the foundations of tradition is balanced by a great responsibility to the future \u2013 both its serious challenges and its exciting possibilities. You have long apprehended the grave reality of climate change. You take seriously the threat that it represents, as well as the necessity and, crucially, the capability of humanity to take meaningful and effective action against it. Senator Lidia Thorpe turned her back on King Charles and Queen Camilla as they stood to attention for the national anthem, sung in English and the local Ngunnawal Indigenous language. Parliamentary reception begins at Parliament House The parliamentary reception, hosted by Anthony Albanese, is beginning in Parliament House. The national anthem was just sung in both English and Ngunnawal language, with Aunty Violet Sheridan welcoming King Charles and Queen Camilla, and guests, to Ngunnawal Country. Sheridan said: A Welcome to Country is a traditional Aboriginal blessing, symbolising the traditional owners of the lands welcoming you. But it also shows your respect for the first peoples of the land you are meeting on. The reason for this custom is to protect your spirit while you are on our land \u2026 I\u2019d like to pay my respects to my elders past, present and emerging, and extend that respect to any First Nations people here this morning. But I\u2019d also like to acknowledge all of the non-Indigenous people here as well. In keeping in the general spirit of friendship and reconciliation, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you, King Charles III, and Queen Camilla, and special guest the prime minister, distinguished guests, to the land of the Ngunnawal people. ACT police have confirmed a 62-year-old man was arrested this morning outside the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where King Charles and Queen Camilla were visiting earlier. The man was arrested for allegedly failing to comply with a police direction. He would be conveyed to the ACT watch house and was expected to be charged, police said. Child allegedly hit with rock through Queensland train window Queensland police are appealing for witnesses after a rock was allegedly thrown through a train window, striking a five-year-old boy in the head. Detectives from the Cairns Child Protection Investigation Unit are investigating the alleged incident on 19 October, that occurred around 4pm near the James and Law Street intersection. The child was taken to Cairns Hospital with serious injuries and was expected to be transported to Townsville Hospital yesterday for further treatment. Police are appealing for witnesses, and anyone with vision, to come forward. Investigations are continuing. A pool reporter has let us know that Queen Camilla is wearing a white silk crepe court dress by Anna Valentine, as well as a diamond and pearl brooch worn previously by Queen Elizabeth II and the Queen Mother. Lidia Thorpe says Indigenous treaty must be part of becoming republic Earlier today, Lidia Thorpe released a statement saying a treaty with First Nations people must be central in any moves towards a republic. Thorpe said she was following the footsteps of her uncle, Robbie Thorpe, who has long advocated for a republic through treaty. She said in a statement there was \u201cunfinished business that we need to resolve before this country can become a republic\u201d. We can move towards a Treaty Republic now. The two processes are not opposed, they\u2019re complimentary. As First Peoples, we never ceded our Sovereignty over this land. The Crown invaded this country, has not sought treaty with First Peoples, and committed a Genocide of our people. King Charles is not the legitimate Sovereign of these lands. Any move towards a republic must not continue this injustice. Treaty must play a central role in establishing an independent nation. A republic without a Treaty must not happen. Thorpe turns her back to national anthem Inside the reception hall, Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe has turned her back to the screen while the national anthem was playing. Thorpe is wearing a long possum-skin coat and is standing at the front along the royals\u2019 route into the hall. NSW premier Chris Minns says King Charles \u2018seems lovely\u2019 The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, says King Charles III \u201cseems lovely\u201d. At a press conference earlier today, Minns was asked what he thought of the British monarch when they met for the first time in Sydney over the weekend. The King, who has been undergoing treatment for cancer, is midway through a quick Australian visit with his wife, Queen Camilla, their first trip here since his coronation. Minns said: It was really brief, but he seems lovely. And he seemed very happy to be in Sydney. I hope he has a good time in Canberra and in Sydney, it\u2019s obviously a brief visit, and that\u2019s in recognition of the fact that he\u2019s undergoing treatment. I think most people are very happy to have him here, and I\u2019m sure tomorrow will be a great day in Sydney. Royals arrive at Parliament House The King and Queen have arrived at Parliament House in a large motorcade of black SUVs with a police escort on motorbikes. They were greeted with a 21-gun salute that absolutely bewildered the large flock of seagulls that normally swim in the water feature out the front of parliament, with the Federation Guard of military personnel presented for inspection by the King. It\u2019s hot out here \u2013 government staffers have been wandering through the gathered crowds, offering sunscreen and water bottles \u2013 but the King took the time to walk through the guard for an official inspection, stopping several times to speak to some members of the army and navy gathered in formation. We can\u2019t hear what they said from our vantage point off to the side. The King and Queen are now meeting the official party, including prime minister Anthony Albanese, opposition leader Peter Dutton, governor general Sam Mostyn and other dignitaries. King Charles and Queen Camilla have arrived on the forecourt of Parliament House, received by the governor general Sam Mostyn, who presented the prime minister Anthony Albanese. The King is meeting the official greeting party right now, and will soon proceed into Parliament to sign the visitor books alongside the PM, president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives. After that, the parliamentary reception will begin. Inside Parliament\u2019s Great Hall, MPs, senators and others with a floor pass for the coming reception are watching the outside arrival proceedings on a big screen and chit-chatting in what is a standing-room morning tea, hurry-up-and-wait kind of scenario. Those in the building who\u2019ve not been so bestowed are crowding around the balconies above the parliamentary foyer, smartphones hoisted, waiting for their majesties to set foot on the marble and glide the few metres towards the hall\u2019s doors and all the folks inside. Me, l\u2019m in the gallery above the supping throng, waiting like everyone else. Until something actually happens, back to you. King Charles III and Queen Camilla have greeted the crowd at the Australian War Memorial, shaking hands and high-fiving kids. The royal couple walked down a cordoned off road leading to the memorial. Queen Camila greeted fans who had waited nearly two hours in the sun on one side while King Charles greeted the other. If you\u2019ll remember earlier in the day, we spoke to Hephner the alpaca and his owner, Robert Fletcher. Hephner was let into the war memorial and got the chance to meet the king. We\u2019re told he sneezed, literally, at the opportunity. Fletcher told Guardian Australia earlier that Hephner wasn\u2019t a spitter but he didn\u2019t rule out sneezing. Crowd grows outside parliament ahead of royal visit Several hundred people have gathered on the Parliament House forecourt ahead of the royal arrival. There\u2019s tight security and members of the military are preparing a ceremonial welcome and 21-gun salute. The crowd, gathered on both edges of the forecourt to see the royal motorcade arrive, is a mix of ages and backgrounds. We found Serena and Gabriella, dressed in suit jackets with Union Jack flags, and a stuffed corgi \u2013 famously, the late Queen\u2019s favourites. They were Serena\u2019s husband and their young daughter, Darcy. Serena said: It\u2019s a historic occasion \u2026 It\u2019s pretty special. Gabriella donned a cardboard mask of Queen Camilla. Others are dressed in Union Jack clothing, or memorabilia from other royal occasions. Out on the front lawns of Parliament House, far from the official forecourt area, are a few large flags with the slogan \u201cabolish the monarchy\u201d. We can\u2019t see much more from this vantage point, but the yellow flags are visible from the area where the King and Queen will arrive. King Charles and Queen Camilla arrive at War Memorial King Charles III and Queen Camilla arrived at the Australian War Memorial a few short moments ago where they were greeted by a crowd of a few thousand. The two will lay a wreath at the memorial before greeting members of the crowd and visiting a memorial that commemorates the military service of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. As the king wound down his window, members of the crowd screamed with joy. One excited crowd member, Carly McCrossin, told the 10 News reporter next to me she kept shouting \u201cI love you, Charles\u201d while holding her young children. Her friends nearby couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d picked the right side to receive a wave from the king. Small group of protestors at War Memorial ahead of royal visit A small group of protesters set up near the Australian War Memorial earlier to protest the arrival of the royals. Some media had been set up at the Australian War Memorial but we were in fixed positions, so couldn\u2019t get much closer. The crowd was holding Aboriginal and Palestinian flags and calling out \u201cno pride in genocide\u201d and \u201calways was, always will be, Aboriginal land\u201d. Police slowly started directing them away. Crowds growing to catch glimpse of King Charles in Canberra Plenty of visitors to the Australian War Memorial for today\u2019s royal visit have gotten into the spirit. One of those is Lynton Martin, who stood out in the crowd with his bejewelled crown and British flag suit. Martin told Guardian Australia he had already been waiting for around 1.5 hours in line before the gates opened. I got it specifically for the royal tour, and it will now be my royal outfit. I went to the coronation last year in England, and over there, there\u2019s pump, there\u2019s pageantry, there\u2019s colour, there\u2019s passion, it\u2019s everywhere. So I wanted to make the King and Queen feel at home here in Australia. Martin explained his passion for the royal family started was influenced by his grandmother\u2019s love of them. The Qantas chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, has apologised to almost 1,700 former ground handlers who were illegally sacked and has pledged to engage in prompt negotiations to determine the size of the compensation payout. The apology came after the federal court ruled today that three of those workers should receive a combined $170,000 for non-economic loss suffered, which is to be used as a basis to calculate a total compensation bill. Hudson said in a statement: We sincerely apologise to our former employees who were impacted by this decision and we know that the onus is on Qantas to learn from this. We recognise the emotional and financial impact this has had on these people and their families. We hope that this provides closure to those who have been affected. Qantas and the Transport Workers\u2019 Union will now engage in mediation over the size of the compensation payout and report back to the court early next month. The total sum is expected to consist of economic and non-economic loss. Separately, the union is also seeking penalties against Qantas. The federal court previously found the airline\u2019s decision to outsource ground handler jobs in 2020 was illegal. But it also ruled that those workers would have been retrenched one year later as Qantas sought to cut costs, limiting the anticipated payout. We love keeping an eye on the federal parliament\u2019s register of interests for any fun updates (financial, property, gifts and hospitality) from our politicians \u2013 but deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley might have one of the more interesting disclosures we\u2019ve seen for a while, noting that she has taken out a personal loan to buy her own plane. Ley, who says she got her pilot\u2019s licence at 19, has picked up a Cessna 182, a four-seater, single engine plane. Her register of interests has today been updated to note a \u201cpersonal loan on purchase of Cessna 182. Creditor: Westpac\u201d. The member for the rural electorate of Farrer, a large area which takes in much of the NSW-Victoria border region, recently got back her pilot\u2019s licence which had lapsed. Ley\u2019s spokesperson said the Cessna was \u201cher favourite aircraft and a reliable working bush aircraft\u201d and that she would use it to travel around her vast electorate. Her electorate of Farrer is 126,500 square kilometres, and one of the largest in the country. It is around the same size as Greece, Bangladesh or Nepal. She is using her plane to help to fly around her electorate at her own expense. Her plane is also a way for her to continue to fly, which is a personal passion for her. She has a passion for aviation which she has spoken about over career and most recently as deputy leader and shadow minister for women. Ley recently told the Nightly newspaper about re-obtaining her pilot\u2019s licence, saying: \u201cThis will give me opportunities to fly to parts of my electorate that I wouldn\u2019t normally visit, but I\u2019ve always considered it very important ... I\u2019m always wanting to visit them more.\u201d King Charles and Queen Camilla arrive in Canberra Vision is being broadcast of King Charles and Queen Camilla arriving in Canberra, to cheers from the crowd as they disembark from their plane. We\u2019ll have more in a moment from Sarah Basford Canales, who is on the scene at the Australian War Memorial, where the royals will shortly visit. Allan says she is determined to \u2018fight back against Nimby-style approach\u2019 The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, was asked whether her housing plan is politically motivated \u2013 given the vast majority of the suburbs she has earmarked for development are in Liberal-held seats. She denied this, but also had a crack at the opposition in the process: This is about building more homes for more Victorians, because for too long, too many Liberals conservative politicians have chased local votes and blocked the building of more homes in their community. I\u2019m determined to fight for those Victorians who need the government to fight back against this Nimby-style approach. We need to fight back against this approach for the simple reason that it\u2019s just not fair. It\u2019s just not fair on younger Victorians to be denied the opportunity people of my generation and others have had to buy their first home, to start a family, to build their long-term wealth. These younger Victorians are being locked out of being able to afford or buy a home, maybe close to where they grew up, close to their family, network of support. They\u2019re being denied choice and opportunity, and that is not fair, and they need someone in their corner fighting for them, and that\u2019s what I and the government will be doing. More on the Victorian stamp-duty announcement The Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, said the scheme will cost the government about $55m and is designed to be a short-term intervention. At the moment, we know that the industry is in a difficult situation, and what they need is the ability to be able to put away these vitally important projects. We expect that over the next 12 months, the material circumstances of the industry will improve. We know, for example, that the spike in commodity prices are already coming off, but they still continue to beset the industry with difficulties. Additionally, I anticipate that we will see \u2013 if not by the end of this year, then certainly by early next year \u2013 interest rates come down. Now, they won\u2019t come crashing down, but they will come down modestly, is our anticipation. But that will take about another six months before \u2026 we do need this period of adjustment and support for the industry, and that\u2019s the rationale behind the 12 months. Victorian premier announcing stamp duty holiday for off-the-plan apartments Victorians buying apartments, townhouses and units off the plan won\u2019t have to pay any stamp duty for 12 months, under a state government initiative aimed at stimulating development. The premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing the policy, which comes into effect immediately and will be open to all buyers for properties of any price point. Currently, stamp duty concessions on off-the-plan properties are only available to first-home buyers and owner occupiers and are capped at $750,000 and $550,000, respectively The government estimates the policy will cut the stamp duty of buyers of a new $620,000 apartment down to just $4,000, a saving of $28,000. Speaking at a recently opened build-to-rent project in North Fitzroy, Allan said the move responds to feedback from the construction industry that the current interest rate burden has slowed sales and stopped developments from beginning. It will get more of these projects away sooner. And what that means [is] that [it] unlocks more homes for everyone. More homes, more opportunities \u2013 whether you want to live in an apartment, a unit or a townhouse. It provides more opportunities for more Victorians to be able to find a home where they want to live. Nick McIntosh argued that law reform is still needed, calling for the establishment of a Safe and Secure Skies Commission \u2013 for \u201cindependent oversight over the entire aviation industry\u201d. We should never have been in this position. These workers really should have their jobs back as we speak. The problem was that the law didn\u2019t allow that to happen. It was too difficult to reinstate 1,700 workers \u2013 it was alright if it was two workers, but 1,700 was too much. That needed to change as well so that if this ever happens again \u2013 and let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t \u2013 but if this ever happens again, these workers will have their jobs back. We won\u2019t be going through years and years of high court challenges, we\u2019ll have these workers back doing what they do best. Union estimates compensation will exceed $100m The assistant secretary of the Transport Workers\u2019 Union, Nick McIntosh, also spoke with the media following the court decision. Taking questions, he said the union estimates the compensation figure is \u201cprobably worth in excess of $100m\u201d. Clearly it\u2019s going to be dependent on different individual cases. The really crucial element, though, is this non-economic loss. This is tax-free money that is in recognition of people\u2019s hardship and distress suffered. This will make a big difference to every one of the 1,700 people, but we do [think] this will be a global figure in excess of $100m. Workers welcome court decision on Qantas outsourcing Damien Pollard, another illegally outsourced worker, told reporters that he was \u201can extremely proud\u201d Qantas worker and expected to be there until he retired: I\u2019ve spent the last four years fielding hundreds of phone calls from my members in Canberra, people that are going through personal problems and mental health issues that were caused by this decision. So today\u2019s judgment by Justice Lee goes some way to facilitating a little bit of recovery from all that and hopefully allowing for us to move on with our lives. Sacked Qantas worker reacts to court decision Don Dixon, one of the illegally outsourced workers with Qantas, spoke with the media and said this was a victory for \u201cordinary Australian workers\u201d. He said working for Qantas was like a family \u2013 so today\u2019s decision is \u201csad in one way but it\u2019s jubilant in all other ways\u201d: We stood up and we fought. Every Australian now should say, you know what \u2013 this is [the] spirit of Australia. You dig in when it gets tough, and you don\u2019t give up and here we are today having a massive victory. Dixon said that \u201cso many families struggled\u201d throughout the campaign and \u201closing your job as quickly and as brutally as it was, it was a horrible thing\u201d: We thought we were there for the rest of our lives. Most of us are getting on in years, so getting another job out in the harsh world was very, very difficult. So this compensation will go a long way of paying people\u2019s mortgages and giving them some hope that all isn\u2019t lost when you group together and you have that fight. A federal court judge has rebuked Qantas for the \u201cvast legal costs\u201d expended to defend claims it illegally sacked almost 1,700 ground handlers in 2020, as former workers move a step closer towards a compensation payout. Justice Michael Lee has ruled that three test cases should each receive $30,000, $40,000 and $100,000 each. They suffered varying amounts of \u201cnon-economic loss\u201d, the court ruled. Justice Lee ordered Qantas and the Transport Workers Union into mediation using the test case amounts to inform a total payout, with the parties due to report back early next month. He found that the workers would have been retrenched one year later in 2021 anyway due to Qantas\u2019 \u201claser-like\u201d focus on cutting costs, limiting compensation to the twelve months following the outsourcing decision. You can read the full story below: Trainee doctors rate training experience \u2018pass\u2019 at best in survey Trainees rated their training experience a \u201cpass\u201d at best in 2023, a survey from the peak body for doctors reveals. Just over one in five respondents didn\u2019t feel comfortable raising bullying, harassment and discrimination with their college and only over half felt safe raising training and wellbeing concerns. Dr Sanjay Hettige, Council of Doctors in training chair described these figures as \u201cfar too low\u201d, warranting greater attention from medical colleges. Only 4 in 10 trainees reported receiving useful feedback from their college, which Hettige said had a \u201chuge impact on trainee health and wellbeing\u201d. Almost 8 in 10 rural based trainees wanted to stay in rural practice, but only a third of metropolitan based trainees said they would consider moving to rural practice. Hettige said that greater exposure to rural training could help solve the rural doctor shortage, but graduates often have \u201cno choice but to go to the big cities\u201d. Unless greater focus is given to creating more rural training opportunities, this trend will continue at the detriment of patients in rural and regional Australia. People already lining up at Parliament House ahead of royal visit It\u2019s still hours before the King and Queen arrive at Parliament House, but eager royal watchers have already been lining up for some time on the building\u2019s forecourt. Before Parliament House staff closed up the front of the building for security reasons, we spotted around 50 people already lined up to get close to the royals; some prepared for the long haul with camp chairs and sandwiches, others bearing flowers and gifts. One family arrived wearing gold plastic crowns. There\u2019s people of all ages, young and old, including a few kids that look like they\u2019ve gotten the day off school to catch a glimpse of Charles and Camilla. We\u2019ll bring you more from Parliament House later this afternoon. Brittany Higgins speaks on risks to baby during \u2018acutely stressful pregnancy\u2019 Brittany Higgins, who is currently pregnant, says that her baby is \u201cperfectly fine and healthy\u201d after a blood test raised red flags in the second trimester. In a post to Instagram, Higgins said it is an \u201cunderstatement to say that we\u2019ve had an acutely stressful pregnancy\u201d, with her and her husband, David Sharaz, having the \u201cscare of [their] lives\u201d with a recent blood test: Our baby had a high probability of a genetic disorder \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t have mattered to us \u2013 but scarily could mean he may be incompatible with life outside of the womb. After an amniocentesis and a seemingly never-ending wait our prayers were answered. Our little guy is perfectly fine and healthy. Higgins said she wanted to talk about this as it \u201ctakes the stigma out of these very real circumstances that people are faced with when trying to start families\u201d. Meanwhile, Higgins and Sharaz have still not sold their French home. Higgins said in July that she was being forced to sell the home to defend the defamation action brought by the Liberal senator Linda Reynolds. Alpaca joins crowd awaiting royal couple At Canberra\u2019s Australian War Memorial, territorians are lining up to catch a glimpse of the king and queen\u2019s first pitstop in the nation\u2019s capital. One of those in line is Robert Fletcher and his alpaca, Hephner. Hephner sported a sparkly gold crown and bow tie, with a blue velvet suit (see our previous post for some photos). And he was on his best behaviour, Fletcher said. We just thought, what an opportunity to dress him up as royalty and bring him today. Hephner is a monarchist, Fletcher said, and would love to meet King Charles III and Queen Camilla. I think this is probably the last opportunity that you\u2019ll ever get to see them, certainly in my lifetime and probably my daughter\u2019s lifetime as well. The gates opened at 10.30am, but whether Hephner with his human family will be allowed to pass through remains to be seen. People lining up to see King and Queen at War Memorial King Charles and Queen Camilla are continuing their tour of Australia, with their first stop today at the War Memorial in Canberra. Mike Bowers is there to capture all the action, and people are already lining up to catch a glimpse of the royals, including Robert Fletcher and his alpaca, Hephner: You can have a read of the full royal itinerary below: Extreme fire danger for west coast of South Australia There is an extreme fire danger rating for the west coast of South Australia today. The Bureau of Meteorology says hot and dry conditions, with gusty north-westerly winds forecast ahead of a cooler, south-westerly change this afternoon and evening. Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s weather forecasts across Australia\u2019s capital cities, from the Bureau of Meteorology: Sydney\u2019s Entertainment Quarter at Moore Park is set for redevelopment, with the state government opening a tender process for its long-term lease. Proposals are being sought to deliver more visitors, live performances and events, a statement from the NSW government said. It is also seeking proposals for additional creative spaces that could host up to 20,000 people. The state government said the EQ is one of Sydney\u2019s key entertainment and sports precincts but is \u201ccurrently underutilised\u201d, considering its location between Centennial Park, the SCG and Allianz Stadium, and proximity to the CBD via the light rail. The current lease has a maximum term expiring in 2046 and the open-tender will allow all parties to put forward proposals. The open tender will commence in the \u201cnear-term\u201d and run through next year. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said in a statement that the EQ was \u201cfalling far short of meeting its full potential\u201d: We want to turn the EQ into a thriving world-class precinct, full of dining and entertainment options, complete with a brand new venue that can host between 15,000 to 20,000 for live music and public events \u2026 From cutting through red tape that has decimated Sydney\u2019s nightlife to getting visitors and entertainment back into the city with projects this like this, we\u2019re focused on turning Sydney into the best entertainment destination in the world. Every Victorian who buys off-the-plan apartments, units and townhouses will have their stamp duty slashed, AAP reports, but only for a limited time. The premier, Jacinta Allan, announced Victorian stamp duty concessions would be expanded to all buyers and uncapped. Thresholds for stamp duty concessions had previously been set at $750,000 and $550,000 for first home buyers and owner-occupiers respectively. But eligibility has been expanded to investors and the value cap removed for one year from today, providing a 100% discount for outstanding construction and refurbishment costs when calculating stamp duty. Allan said the 12-month stimulus plan was in response to under-pressure builders crying out for help after successive interest rate rises. She told Sunrise earlier: It\u2019s certainly having an impact on the housing industry. That\u2019s why we\u2019re providing this support. It\u2019s good for builders, it\u2019s certainly good for buyers who will save money, it\u2019s good for building more homes. The premier foreshadowed she would release more housing policies and initiatives across the rest of the week. Bowen underscores gas won\u2019t be included in any capacity scheme The energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been taking questions after his speech, confirming he wouldn\u2019t include gas into the capacity investment scheme (that was set up speed up the renewables\u2019 rollout). Bowen noted NSW had included gas in its long-term auction system, and noted that no gas operator had bothered to bid \u201cbecause it is so expensive\u201d. Hence, putting gas into the federal scheme \u201cachieves nothing\u201d because such project would never get support. \u201cIt\u2019s just a distraction,\u201d he said. (His federal counterpart, Ted O\u2019Brien, had argued last week: \u201cThe inclusion of gas in the CIS is crucial to addressing the immediate challenges in Australia\u2019s gas market, ensuring reliable electricity supply, and stabilising energy prices.\u201d) Bowen, meanwhile, downplayed reports in the past week or so in the Murdoch tabloids and the AFR about Norway\u2019s Equinor pulling out of the running for a proposed offshore windfarm zone near Illawarra. He noted that Equinor had announced its exit from the race back in June (and hence, wondered why it was being repeated). The company was still in the running for a zone planned for the offshore Hunter River, up the NSW coast, and the much larger zone off the Gippsland coast was going \u201cgangbusters\u201d. As we anticipated, that second round of the CIS is only an acceleration (albeit a significant one). The overall size of the scheme will not be expanded, Bowen\u2019s office has confirmed. Meanwhile, Bowen hinted the government won\u2019t be releasing its 2035 emissions targets this side of the election. He would be taking advice from the Climate Change Authority (now chaired by Matt Kean, the former NSW treasurer and energy minister in a Liberal-led coalition). No nation had yet lodged 2035 carbon cuts to the UN body (the UNFCCC), Bowen noted. Perhaps Australia won\u2019t be in a hurry to sign up. Andrew Barr speaks following election win in ACT The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier after his election win over the weekend. Barr, already the longest-serving political leader in the country, fended off a negative swing and an independent surge to win his third election as chief minister. He noted swings against some incumbent parties, including Labor, and said \u201cthere are always lessons to learn from each election campaign\u201d: It is looking increasingly certain of 10 Labor and three Green [seats], with a possibility of an additional seat either going to Labor or Green in the southern electorate of Brindabella. But there\u2019s postal votes and interstate votes that will need to be added to that count. We would hope this would be resolved by the end of the week. Responding to accusations that Labor is dominating the jurisdiction, Barr argued that \u201cpower is always shared in the ACT\u201d with crossbenchers: In this instance, we will expect a crossbench of at least five and possibly six members out of our 25-member assembly. But they have generally represented progressive views. The Canberra Liberals are the most right-wing branch of the Liberal party in this country, and that\u2019s been ably demonstrated election after election \u2026 We don\u2019t make any apologies for running successful campaigns. Barr argued that \u201cvotes were quite sharply weaker for the Liberal party\u201d after its leader, Elizabeth Lee, was caught giving the middle finger to a journalist. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, says the government will accelerate the pace of its capacity investment scheme, an auction system that helps underwrite the rollout of renewables. Bowen has told an AFR energy conference in Sydney that its second round of investments has been lifted to 6GW of new renewable generation from 4GW. Storage (mostly big batteries) will be lifted to 4GW from an original 2GW. He said: I expected it to work well, and it\u2019s working better than I thought. The scheme guarantees a minimum payment for the power supply \u2013 but if wholesale prices are higher than a certain level, the government would take a share of the cut. It\u2019s not clear if the acceleration of the plans means the overall scheme will be larger than anticipated. Perhaps there\u2019s also an insurance element. Auction results can\u2019t be overturned if the government were to change at the next election. The Coalition has said it wants to introduce gas in the scheme (something that states such as Victoria had opposed in the past). Plans for seven nuclear power plants are unlikely to gain market interest to include them in any action, given most reports estimate such generation to be far more expensive than wind or solar (even with storage added). Bowen said uncertainty in the industry was something the Coalition was \u201cdeliberately\u201d creating by introducing nuclear proposals to Australia\u2019s mix. Bowen said he remains confident that the government can meet its 2030 goal of supplying 82% of electricity from clean energy sources. Bowen noted too that some parts of the grid had record minimum demand on the grid over the weekend, something we touched a week or so ago here: Byelection results reflect shift away from major parties: Ryan Monique Ryan was also asked about Jacqui Scruby\u2019s election results in Pittwater at the weekend, and if they makes her feel more comfortable ahead of the next federal election regarding retaining her own seat. She said: [Almost] a third of Australians did not vote for the major parties [in 2022], I don\u2019t think we have seen anything since that time that\u2019s changed their minds. I think people are seeing that independents can hold the governments to account at all levels of government. We play an important role, we\u2019re pragmatic and centrist and we contribute. The results from the elections over the weekend reflected that. Ryan says Allan \u2018playing politics\u2019 with Nimby-ism suggestion Monique Ryan was also asked about suggestions from the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, that part of the opposition to the rezoning plan is \u201cNimby-ism\u201d. Ryan accused the premier of \u201cplaying politics with this\u201d and said she is \u201ctrying to create a point of difference:\u201d I\u2019m not interested in that. I\u2019m interested in ensuring \u2026 these developments will be [designed] in a way that\u2019s sensible and sustainable, they\u2019ll be delivered on time \u2026 and we\u2019ll retain the character of the suburbs in which we\u2019ve chosen to live, while welcoming hopefully hundreds of thousands of new people into the area. Independent Kooyong MP responds to Victorian government rezoning plan Monique Ryan, the federal member for Kooyong, was up on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss the Victorian government\u2019s rezoning plan: Ryan has been quoted in the Financial Review as saying new developments proposed by the Allan government could result in buildings that were too tall, ugly, and slow to be delivered. She responded to this, and said: The announcement this weekend from the premier was for nine massive new developments just in the electorate of Kooyong. That\u2019s huge. These could be up to 20 storeys high. Of course that will cause some concern from people who live in the area, who have chosen to live there, because it\u2019s a beautiful part of the world. Ryan said that people need \u201ccertainty\u201d their kids will still get into local schools and that they won\u2019t lose green spaces and amenities, and that more detail is needed on the plan. We\u2019re not saying we don\u2019t want it, I think people in my part of the world are welcoming it. We\u2019d also like some assurances from the government they will include social and affordable housing in these developments. We really don\u2019t have any detail as of yet and that\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s missing at this point. Teal independent speaks following byelection results at the weekend The independent Jacqui Scruby, a Climate 200-backed former adviser to federal MPs Zali Steggall and Sophie Scamps, is set to win the Pittwater byelection in NSW. She spoke with ABC RN this morning and said \u201cof course\u201d her results are \u201cpart of a broader trend\u201d towards independents, and \u201cpeople wanting a different type of politics\u201d: So this representation that is community representation, rather than party representation, and also the ability for independence, I think, to work across party lines, hold governments\u2019 to account, but also work collaboratively with governments in order to deliver \u2026 I\u2019ve earned the trust of traditional Liberal voters, and I will seek to maintain that trust and gain the trust of others. Scruby argued that people are \u201csick of divisive politics\u201d and are \u201clooking for representation that is not divisive, that\u2019s really practical\u201d: And it\u2019s a bit more nuanced as well, because part of community representation is bringing people into their democracy and helping them understand the nuance of policies, rather than \u2026 opposition for the sake of opposition. Scruby said that in the three NSW byelections, the Liberal candidates that were chosen didn\u2019t live in their electorate \u2013 and \u201chow that played \u2026 maybe is a lesson to the Liberal party\u201d. Shadow housing minister responds to business call for $10bn housing reform While on ABC RN, the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, was also asked about calls from the Business Council for a $10bn federal plan to cut the cost of construction. You can read all the details on this below: The business council is calling an increase in foreign workers with construction skills. Sukkar was asked: how can the Coalition back this if it wants to cut the number of permanent visas? Sukkar argued that \u201cyou\u2019ve got to reorientate the composition of who you bring in\u201d: In recent times, we\u2019ve had the Labor party bringing in more yoga instructors than bricklayers \u2026 We\u2019ve made clear we\u2019re going to reduce migration to free up 100,000 homes for Australians. Now you can simultaneously ensure that of the generous migration program that Australia does have in place, that you reorientate it to the sorts of skills we need. The government and the opposition have both promised cuts to migration in response, at least partially, to Australia\u2019s housing crisis. But how much does immigration actually contribute to the cost of housing and rent? You can read more on this below: Shadow housing minister critical of rollout of Victorian rezoning announcement The shadow minister for housing, Michael Sukkar, was up on ABC RN this morning to speak on the Victorian government\u2019s rezoning plan, as we flagged earlier: Sukkar criticised the state government for a lack of consultation with the community and said: If you\u2019re going to make any of these sorts of investments or changes, you\u2019ve got to consult with the people who are affected now \u2026 For people to wake up one morning and read that there\u2019s going to be a 20 story tower next door to them, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable that they\u2019re a bit crazy \u2026 That\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard [and] that\u2019s the problem with this announcement, there\u2019s been no discussion with the community. Classroom mobile ban hailed success by NSW government The NSW government\u2019s decision to ban mobile phones in thousands of public school classrooms has been hailed a success, AAP reports. An education department survey of almost 1,000 public school principals found huge support for the ban, with 95% reporting positive results. The premier, Chris Minns, said in a statement today that one year in \u201cit\u2019s clear, this was the right decision\u201d: Without the distraction of a mobile phone in their pockets, students have been able to focus on their learning, while building stronger relationships with their classmates. The survey also found 81% of principals agreed students\u2019 learning had improved, 87% said students were less distracted in the classroom and 86% said socialising had improved. The ban was introduced at the beginning of term four in 2023. Allan calls out opposition to housing plan Jacinta Allan said that \u201cNimby-ism\u201d \u2013 aka a \u201cNot In My Back Yard\u201d approach to new housing \u2013 was \u201cone way to describe\u201d how opponents to her plan are feeling. She told ABC News Breakfast that for too long, \u201ctoo many politicians have not addressed this key fundamental issue which is why we\u2019ve got to this point.\u201d We\u2019ve got to this point because the loudest voices, who don\u2019t necessarily represent all of the community, have particularly got in the way of building new homes. They\u2019ve been the blockers. They\u2019re particularly Liberal members of parliament, like we saw yesterday in Brighton, and we\u2019ve got Monique Ryan, who is not Liberal. We have residents who are not necessarily Liberal members either. Yesterday, angry Brighton residents surrounded the pub where Allan announced the housing plan to media, chanting: \u201cShame, premier, shame.\u201d Allan said what she would talk to the community about is whether it \u201cmakes sense to have taller buildings hugging the train station itself, being close to the train station, and then having lower levels as you move away from the train stations\u201d: \u2026 we\u2019re going to embark on a consultation, community by community, street by street, house by house. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has been speaking with ABC News Breakfast about a plan to create 50 new \u201cactivity zones\u201d to help deliver more than 30,000 additional homes across Melbourne by 2051. Defending the plan, she said that more homes need to be built in the state, particularly for younger Victorians under 40: Anyone under the age of 40 knows just how tough it is to find a home, particularly to find a home close to where they grew up, close to families. We need to get on and build more homes, particularly in and around the suburbs of Melbourne. Allan was asked about pushback from locals, including those in Brighton, and whether she should have spoken with residents. She said 25 zoning locations had been announced, with another 25 to come, and \u201cwe\u2019re going to get on and talk to people in those local communities.\u201d I know from my conversations with many Victorians that putting homes next to a train station just makes sense for so many people \u2026 The status quo is just not an option any more. It\u2019s tougher and tougher for younger people to get into a home, to start a family, to build their long-term wealth that previous generations have had that opportunity to. We\u2019ve got to get on and find new ways to push on and build more homes, because the status quo is locking out too many people. Bid to avoid post-2032 homelessness in Queensland There are fears Brisbane could be heading toward a post-2032 Olympic Games homelessness crisis if the next state government does not take action, AAP reports. The warning comes after a Q Shelter-commissioned Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute report on the Olympics\u2019 impact on homelessness and the local housing market. Q Shelter\u2019s CEO, Fiona Caniglia, said the \u201cbest-case scenario is people will be pushed out to the regions\u201d. But if you live here now and for reasons that are important to you, like work and family, then we need to create a framework so you can stay, and so you\u2019re not forced to move because of the impact of the games. Reports will be published annually leading up to the 2032 games to monitor housing market conditions and the responses to homelessness in Brisbane. The aim is to help calibrate policy responses to ensure Brisbane 2032 delivers its intended legacy of social inclusion. However, Q Shelter said it was not out of the realm of possibility that Brisbane could be the first games host that doesn\u2019t worsen homelessness. This could be done through legacy planning, including repurposing the athletes\u2019 village into social housing. Overnight, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said \u201cthe worst is behind us\u201d when it comes to inflation. Speaking to 7News\u2019 Spotlight program, he said the peak in inflation was now \u201cin the rear-view mirror, and we\u2019re not complacent about that\u201d. But we are confident that, having been through a very difficult time together, better days are ahead. Asked whether that meant interest rates would come down before a potential election next May, Chalmers said there was \u201creally good reasons for treasurers of either political persuasion not to make predictions about interest rate movements\u201d. The market expects that there will be interest rate cuts in 2025 \u2026 as treasurer, I\u2019ve been very careful not to make those kinds of predictions. Chalmers said that Australia \u201ccame quite close\u201d to recession in the first two quarters of this year, and that growth was \u201cvery, very flat\u201d in March and June. And if I\u2019m honest with you \u2026 there were times where we feared that the economy would go backwards. But if you\u2019re asking me, was I worried at the time? Too right I was \u2026 There were some moments in the lead up to the release of [the national accounts] where there was a very substantial risk that the economy might have gone backwards. A lot of relief when we discovered that it hadn\u2019t. Good morning, and welcome back to a new week on the Australia news live blog. I\u2019m Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be taking you through our rolling coverage this Monday. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said that \u201cthe worst is behind us\u201d when it comes to inflation. Speaking on 7News\u2019 Spotlight program last night, he said: When it comes to inflation specifically, the worst is behind us \u2026 The peak in inflation is now in the rear-view mirror and we\u2019re not complacent about that, we\u2019re cautious about that, but we are confident that having been through a very difficult time together, better days are ahead. We\u2019ll bring you more from his interview in a moment. Meanwhile, King Charles and Queen Camilla are continuing their tour of Australia as part of their first visit to the country since Charles became its reigning monarch. This morning, the couple will visit the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and the prime minister will host a reception at Parliament House. The king will meet firefighters and bushfire researchers at CSIRO, while Camilla will meet the founder of the charity donations platform GIVIT. There will also be a tour of the National Botanical Gardens.

That\u2019s the only reason he makes those films.\u2019\u201d He gives one of his joyful, crinkle-faced grins, his eyes vanishing into creases, his entire face seeming to smile.

I hear they\u2019re great!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Baker\u2019s latest film, Anora, is a glorious, high-energy tragi-comedy about a Russian-American lapdancer, played by the Oscar-tipped Mikey Madison, who comes to regret her impetuous marriage to the giggly 21-year-old son of a Russian oligarch. The director still looks stunned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/25/anora-tale-of-a-stripper-who-marries-a-russian-oligarch-wins-palme-dor-at-cannes\">Anora scooped the Palme d\u2019Or</a> at the Cannes film festival this year. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d made a crazy-ass exploitation movie,\u201d he says, his face crinkling again.</p> <p>If the impression he gives is of a U-rated boy in an X-rated world, that fits with his childhood memories of accompanying his father, who worked as a lawyer in Manhattan, on trips into the city from their home in New Jersey. \u201cIt was a \u2018Welcome to the jungle\u2019 moment every time,\u201d he gasps. \u201cWe\u2019d drive out of the Lincoln Tunnel and that would bring you right down 42nd Street. This was the heyday, when it was full of grindhouses and porn theatres. It would be \u2018Marilyn Chambers XXX\u2019 everywhere.\u201d He mimics his younger self, eyes on stalks as he gazes from the passenger window: \u201c\u2018<em>W</em><em>hoa! What\u2019s going on?</em>\u2019 That stuff really stayed with me.\u201d</p>    <p>Maybe the people crying \u201chorndog\u201d have a point. \u201cThere <em>was</em> a certain amount of hands-on research for Anora,\u201d says Baker, aware that this is not merely a figure of speech. In preparation for writing the film, he frequented the clubs where Anora (or Ani, as she prefers to be called) might work. This was no solo mission: he was accompanied by Madison, whom he had cast before even writing the script, having seen her playing one of the Manson family in the gory climax of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Also in attendance at the clubs were Samantha Quan, Baker\u2019s wife and producer, and one or two other crew members. But still.</p> <p>\u201cWe participated in lapdances,\u201d he says sheepishly. \u201cWe <em>had</em> to. It was the most embarrassing thing, real Curb Your Enthusiasm stuff. I\u2019m trying to do an interview while also having a lapdance, which is so ridiculous. Halfway through the dance, I would be like, \u2018OK, so what does a guy normally do at this moment?\u2019 I\u2019d totally kill the vibe. The dancers were cracking up.\u201d</p> <p>Some of them had had experiences that were not so different from what they envisaged Ani going through in the film. \u201cThere was a sad, sobering moment where one woman said, \u2018This happened to me.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if it was an oligarch, but she married into a rich family and they rejected her. She got teary-eyed about it.\u201d</p> <p>The film alludes to the generally sanitised Hollywood view of sex work by showing Ani\u2019s young husband-to-be sliding across the floor of his mansion in his socks, just like Tom Cruise in Risky Business, the 1983 comedy about a teenager who turns his house into a brothel for the night. But Baker found that the Pretty Woman paradigm still endures: \u201cWe heard it from many dancers, \u2018Once I marry that rich businessman, I won\u2019t have to do this any more.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s not so different from playing the lottery, is it? \u201cSure. You get it in all lines of work, all areas of life. \u2018One day I\u2019ll \u2026\u2019\u201d Win the Palme d\u2019Or? \u201cExactly!\u201d</p>    <p>How can a woman like Ani find fulfilment? \u201cGetting the respect she deserves from somebody who actually sees and hears her would be a step,\u201d Baker reflects. \u201cPart of the reason I made the film is because I realised our Cinderella stories have changed in the last 10 years. It\u2019s about wealth and fame now. When I was growing up, the American dream was a house in the suburbs and, hopefully, you\u2019d make enough for your kids to go to college. That was pretty much it. That\u2019s changed, and this is maybe what the film is commenting on.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to imagine a nastier version of the movie, in which Ani\u2019s Russians in-laws don\u2019t bother trying to get the marriage annulled, but instead kill her and dump the body in the Hudson. But what\u2019s striking about Baker\u2019s films is that \u2013 despite his characters\u2019 poverty, criminality, desperation and drug use \u2013 they are largely devoid of menace. Anora may owe much to Jonathan Demme\u2019s 1986 screwball thriller Something Wild, but it has no equivalent to the terrifying sociopath played by Ray Liotta in that movie. Perhaps there is an inherent sweetness in Baker\u2019s outlook that precludes him from engaging with that species of threat? \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I watch very extreme films and I\u2019m friends with people like Gaspar No\u00e9,\u201d he says, namechecking the director of the gruelling Irreversible. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve never gone there. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p> <p>Even firearms are conspicuous by their absence: Baker\u2019s 2004 film Take Out, about a Chinese immigrant working as a delivery driver, is the only one of his films to feature a gun. It was 15 years ago that Baker and the actor Karren Karagulian, who has starred in all his movies, started discussing what would eventually become Anora. From the start, they set themselves the challenge of making a gangster story, set in the Russian-American community of Brighton Beach (also known as Little Odessa), without ever showing a gun. \u201cWe wondered, \u2018Is it even possible?\u2019\u201d Anora proves it is.</p> <p>Guns and menace aren\u2019t the only elements missing from Baker\u2019s movies. Aside from Willem Dafoe, who was Oscar-nominated for playing a sweet-natured motel manager in 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/09/the-florida-project-review-sean-baker-walt-disney-world\">The Florida Project</a>, Baker has steered clear of stars, perhaps fearing that they could wreck the loosey-goosey methods that are vital to his work: the extensive improvisations, the last-minute rewrites, the scenes where actors mingle with unsuspecting members of the public.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of friends in the industry who have had nightmare experiences working with big Hollywood actors,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they get through the day. I would throw in the towel. I would love to work with Jennifer Lawrence or Leonardo DiCaprio some time. I hear they\u2019re great! But you never know. It could really derail a movie.\u201d</p>    <p>His immersive process, and its tendency to smudge the line between life and work, is similarly out-of-step with the A-list. But does it take a personal toll on him? \u201cWell, yes,\u201d he says, smile fading for the first time. \u201cThere\u2019s a responsibility that one can take on when using real people who are perhaps struggling. I have sometimes adopted a sort of guardian position with my actors. I couldn\u2019t do it any other way. Also, I am drawn to ...\u201d He narrows his eyes. \u201cThe word isn\u2019t \u2018dark\u2019. But let\u2019s say \u2018alternative\u2019 lifestyles. I find myself getting in a little too deep on a personal level. I\u2019ve had addiction problems throughout my life.\u201d</p> <p>Baker is open about having been hooked on heroin in his 20s. \u201cI will never go back to opiates because that would be suicide,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I have found myself in places that I didn\u2019t think I would be, in my 40s and 50s. Sometimes I\u2019ll think, \u2018Why am I partying like this?\u2019 It\u2019ll be because I\u2019ve gone into a world that I probably wouldn\u2019t be in were I not interested in covering it in a movie. Or I\u2019m finding it romantic for whatever reason.\u201d</p> <p>Can he maintain a distance in those moments? \u201cThere is distance, yes, because I\u2019m there on more of an observational level. But I <em>am </em>participating.\u201d He has a rethink: \u201cSo, I guess there\u2019s not that much distance. That can be scary, and I have to watch myself.\u201d</p> <p>Although the film industry is a notoriously dangerous place for anyone with those appetites, Baker claims not to have experienced that side of Hollywood. \u201cIt seems to be extremely clean these days. But I\u2019m so indie, I\u2019m outside all that. A lot of my peers \u2013 and I\u2019m not slamming them here \u2013 are pretty straight-edge. There are a lot of comic-book nerds making movies!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/21/anora-review-stellar-turn-from-mikey-madison-in-sex-work-non-love-story\">Anora review \u2013 stellar turn from Mikey Madison in sex work non-love story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I ask whether he is now clean, and he glances away.

I was clean for seven years, and then I realised my drug of choice was opiates, so I started being OK with doing other stuff. It comes and goes. There\u2019s a staple of weed, obviously, which has been more or less normalised in the US. But there\u2019s always the partaking of other, um, party substances. And, uh, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave that.\u201d</p> <p>He says this without a trace of defensiveness, but rather in a sweet and conscientious tone, as if placing a fragile object out of harm\u2019s way, or turning his U-rated face away from the X-rated world.</p> <p>\u2022 Anora is in UK cinemas from 1 November.</p>",

If the impression he gives is of a U-rated boy in an X-rated world, that fits with his childhood memories of accompanying his father, who worked as a lawyer in Manhattan, on trips into the city from their home in New Jersey. \u201cIt was a \u2018Welcome to the jungle\u2019 moment every time,\u201d he gasps. \u201cWe\u2019d drive out of the Lincoln Tunnel and that would bring you right down 42nd Street. This was the heyday, when it was full of grindhouses and porn theatres. It would be \u2018Marilyn Chambers XXX\u2019 everywhere.\u201d He mimics his younger self, eyes on stalks as he gazes from the passenger window: \u201c\u2018Whoa! What\u2019s going on?\u2019 That stuff really stayed with me.\u201d Maybe the people crying \u201chorndog\u201d have a point. \u201cThere was a certain amount of hands-on research for Anora,\u201d says Baker, aware that this is not merely a figure of speech. In preparation for writing the film, he frequented the clubs where Anora (or Ani, as she prefers to be called) might work. This was no solo mission: he was accompanied by Madison, whom he had cast before even writing the script, having seen her playing one of the Manson family in the gory climax of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Also in attendance at the clubs were Samantha Quan, Baker\u2019s wife and producer, and one or two other crew members. But still. \u201cWe participated in lapdances,\u201d he says sheepishly. \u201cWe had to. It was the most embarrassing thing, real Curb Your Enthusiasm stuff. I\u2019m trying to do an interview while also having a lapdance, which is so ridiculous. Halfway through the dance, I would be like, \u2018OK, so what does a guy normally do at this moment?\u2019 I\u2019d totally kill the vibe. The dancers were cracking up.\u201d Some of them had had experiences that were not so different from what they envisaged Ani going through in the film. \u201cThere was a sad, sobering moment where one woman said, \u2018This happened to me.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if it was an oligarch, but she married into a rich family and they rejected her. She got teary-eyed about it.\u201d The film alludes to the generally sanitised Hollywood view of sex work by showing Ani\u2019s young husband-to-be sliding across the floor of his mansion in his socks, just like Tom Cruise in Risky Business, the 1983 comedy about a teenager who turns his house into a brothel for the night. But Baker found that the Pretty Woman paradigm still endures: \u201cWe heard it from many dancers, \u2018Once I marry that rich businessman, I won\u2019t have to do this any more.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s not so different from playing the lottery, is it? \u201cSure. You get it in all lines of work, all areas of life. \u2018One day I\u2019ll \u2026\u2019\u201d Win the Palme d\u2019Or? \u201cExactly!\u201d How can a woman like Ani find fulfilment? \u201cGetting the respect she deserves from somebody who actually sees and hears her would be a step,\u201d Baker reflects. \u201cPart of the reason I made the film is because I realised our Cinderella stories have changed in the last 10 years. It\u2019s about wealth and fame now. When I was growing up, the American dream was a house in the suburbs and, hopefully, you\u2019d make enough for your kids to go to college. That was pretty much it. That\u2019s changed, and this is maybe what the film is commenting on.\u201d It is easy to imagine a nastier version of the movie, in which Ani\u2019s Russians in-laws don\u2019t bother trying to get the marriage annulled, but instead kill her and dump the body in the Hudson. But what\u2019s striking about Baker\u2019s films is that \u2013 despite his characters\u2019 poverty, criminality, desperation and drug use \u2013 they are largely devoid of menace. Anora may owe much to Jonathan Demme\u2019s 1986 screwball thriller Something Wild, but it has no equivalent to the terrifying sociopath played by Ray Liotta in that movie. Perhaps there is an inherent sweetness in Baker\u2019s outlook that precludes him from engaging with that species of threat? \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I watch very extreme films and I\u2019m friends with people like Gaspar No\u00e9,\u201d he says, namechecking the director of the gruelling Irreversible. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve never gone there. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d Even firearms are conspicuous by their absence: Baker\u2019s 2004 film Take Out, about a Chinese immigrant working as a delivery driver, is the only one of his films to feature a gun. It was 15 years ago that Baker and the actor Karren Karagulian, who has starred in all his movies, started discussing what would eventually become Anora. From the start, they set themselves the challenge of making a gangster story, set in the Russian-American community of Brighton Beach (also known as Little Odessa), without ever showing a gun. \u201cWe wondered, \u2018Is it even possible?\u2019\u201d Anora proves it is. Guns and menace aren\u2019t the only elements missing from Baker\u2019s movies. Aside from Willem Dafoe, who was Oscar-nominated for playing a sweet-natured motel manager in 2017\u2019s The Florida Project, Baker has steered clear of stars, perhaps fearing that they could wreck the loosey-goosey methods that are vital to his work: the extensive improvisations, the last-minute rewrites, the scenes where actors mingle with unsuspecting members of the public. \u201cI have a lot of friends in the industry who have had nightmare experiences working with big Hollywood actors,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they get through the day. I would throw in the towel. I would love to work with Jennifer Lawrence or Leonardo DiCaprio some time. I hear they\u2019re great! But you never know. It could really derail a movie.\u201d His immersive process, and its tendency to smudge the line between life and work, is similarly out-of-step with the A-list. But does it take a personal toll on him? \u201cWell, yes,\u201d he says, smile fading for the first time. \u201cThere\u2019s a responsibility that one can take on when using real people who are perhaps struggling. I have sometimes adopted a sort of guardian position with my actors. I couldn\u2019t do it any other way. Also, I am drawn to ...\u201d He narrows his eyes. \u201cThe word isn\u2019t \u2018dark\u2019. But let\u2019s say \u2018alternative\u2019 lifestyles. I find myself getting in a little too deep on a personal level. I\u2019ve had addiction problems throughout my life.\u201d Baker is open about having been hooked on heroin in his 20s. \u201cI will never go back to opiates because that would be suicide,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I have found myself in places that I didn\u2019t think I would be, in my 40s and 50s. Sometimes I\u2019ll think, \u2018Why am I partying like this?\u2019 It\u2019ll be because I\u2019ve gone into a world that I probably wouldn\u2019t be in were I not interested in covering it in a movie. Or I\u2019m finding it romantic for whatever reason.\u201d Can he maintain a distance in those moments? \u201cThere is distance, yes, because I\u2019m there on more of an observational level. But I am participating.\u201d He has a rethink: \u201cSo, I guess there\u2019s not that much distance. That can be scary, and I have to watch myself.\u201d Although the film industry is a notoriously dangerous place for anyone with those appetites, Baker claims not to have experienced that side of Hollywood. \u201cIt seems to be extremely clean these days. But I\u2019m so indie, I\u2019m outside all that. A lot of my peers \u2013 and I\u2019m not slamming them here \u2013 are pretty straight-edge. There are a lot of comic-book nerds making movies!\u201d I ask whether he is now clean, and he glances away. The smile is back but it is rueful now rather than carefree. \u201cUm, I\u2019m not,\u201d he says at last. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I was clean for seven years, and then I realised my drug of choice was opiates, so I started being OK with doing other stuff. It comes and goes. There\u2019s a staple of weed, obviously, which has been more or less normalised in the US. But there\u2019s always the partaking of other, um, party substances. And, uh, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave that.\u201d He says this without a trace of defensiveness, but rather in a sweet and conscientious tone, as if placing a fragile object out of harm\u2019s way, or turning his U-rated face away from the X-rated world. \u2022 Anora is in UK cinemas from 1 November.",

      "body": "<p>Cleveland\u2019s fanbase came into Sunday\u2019s home Browns-Bengals showdown steeped in feelings. Some of them greeted their own quarterback, Deshaun Watson, <a href=\"https://x.com/Reflog_18/status/1848045976751100129\">with deafening boos</a> as he ran on to the field. If there was any doubt about how many fans feel about Watson, the same crowd <a href=\"https://x.com/Reflog_18/status/1848045976751100129\">showered running back Nick Chubb with cheers</a> at an even higher decibel as he made his return from a lengthy injury layoff.</p> <p>Watson looks like he is headed for a lengthy period on the sidelines himself: in the second quarter, he went down with what <a href=\"https://x.com/AdamSchefter/status/1848378629048139792\">ESPN reported is a ruptured achilles</a>. His season is over. Possibly it\u2019s the end of Watson\u2019s career \u2013 the quarterback\u2019s play has declined and achilles injuries often leave players a shadow of their former selves. As Watson was carted off the field in tears, the feelings in Cleveland were on overdrive. For some, there was catharsis or a feeling that karma had been served. For others, there was legitimate sadness. After all, despite Watson\u2019s dismal performance as Cleveland\u2019s man under center, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/sep/09/deshaun-watson-boos-cleveland-browns-fans-nfl\">and the allegations against him as a man</a>, you never want to see someone injured. Although maybe in this case, you do. Some of the Browns fans did: there were scattered cheers when Watson went down injured, a reaction Cleveland cornerback Greg Newsome II later <a href=\"https://x.com/Spencito_/status/1848112313141964818\">described as \u201cbullshit\u201d</a>.</p> <p>One feeling that all Browns fans can agree upon is regret. Deep regret. If Browns owner Jimmy Haslam giving Watson $230m in guaranteed money in 2022 wasn\u2019t already the worst contract in NFL history, the achilles injury on Sunday made it official.</p> <p>Haslam set the gold standard in how not to gift a contract. Not only by the sheer amount of guaranteed money, the most in NFL history, but by handing the franchise to a player who was almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/browns-qb-deshaun-watson-suspended-11-games-fined-5-million-following-settlement\">set for a lengthy suspension</a> over those sexual misconduct allegations (the ban ended up being 11 games). Haslam\u2019s plan that Watson the player would make Watson the person palatable failed from the jump.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s debut didn\u2019t come until Week 13 of the 2022 season. His performance that season was meh at best. He looked nothing like the young Houston Texans quarterback who was both efficient and explosive. The Browns went 3-3 with Watson under center in 2022 and finished 7-10, last in the AFC North. Every game he played that season \u2013 with incessant boos at stadiums around the US \u2013 was also a reminder of what many thought of Watson the person.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s second season was cut short by a shoulder injury. Everyman hero Joe Flacco stepped in and did an admirable job but it was Cleveland\u2019s elite defense that led them to a playoff berth.</p> <p>Any glimmer of hope for the Browns that Watson would morph into even an above average quarterback quickly evaporated this season. Under Watson, the Browns have a 1-6 record, including <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671853\">Sunday\u2019s 21-14 loss to Cincinnati</a>. He had yet to top 200 passing yards in a game this season, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/qbr\">was last in QBR</a> among qualified quarterbacks. Moving on from him will be expensive too: <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/player/_/id/21753/deshaun-watson\">he\u2019s guaranteed $46m a season</a> in the final two years of his contract. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/10/the-jets-are-a-mess-but-theyre-not-the-most-hopeless-franchise-in-the-nfl\">plenty of badly run franchises in the NFL</a>: but none of them are dumb enough to take Watson and his huge contract off the Browns\u2019 hands.</p> <p>So, from a football-only standpoint Watson\u2019s tumultuous time in Cleveland has been a failure. Add in the fact that he\u2019s an alleged predator, with more than 24 women accusing him of sexual misconduct and the Browns\u2019 thinking is unfathomable (Watson settled more than <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/browns-qb-deshaun-watson-settles-latest-civil-lawsuit-brought-by-woman-alleging-sexual-assault\">two dozen lawsuits involving his accusers out of court</a> but he has never been criminally charged over the allegations). For many fans \u2013 including some in Cleveland \u2013 there is no passer rating Watson could achieve to erase the allegations that surround him.</p> <p>The Browns\u2019 sad and seedy Watson era is going to take time to move past, although some may not understand what that means. Jameis Winston, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/25/us/florida-state-fsu-settles-jameis-winston-rape-lawsuit/index.html\">who hardly has a clean reputation himself</a>, ended Sunday\u2019s game as Cleveland\u2019s quarterback. He was asked about Watson after the game. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that I had a chance to serve Deshaun, but I am very upset with the reaction to a man that has had the world against him for the past four years,\u201d said Winston. Perhaps it\u2019s worth Winston asking why the world was against Watson in the first place.</p> <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jared Goff, quarterback, Detroit Lions.</strong> Goff\u2019s signature play in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671724\">the Lions\u2019 31-29 win</a> over the previously undefeated Minnesota Vikings was the beautiful 35-yard touchdown strike to Amon-Ra St Brown in the closing minutes of the first half. The Lions quarterback diced Minnesota\u2019s Cover 0, shaking off the safety and evading the pass rush. Not only was it a momentum changer, it sent a reminder to Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores. Goff thrives when blitzed, unlike many of the other quarterbacks Flores\u2019 defense has terrorized.</p>    <p>It wasn\u2019t perfect but Goff continued his hot streak Sunday. Per AP, Goff\u2019s stat line \u2013 22 for 25 for 280 yards with two touchdowns and no turnovers in his third straight game with a 140-plus passer rating \u2013 means he joined Aaron Rodgers (2011), Kurt Warner (1999) and Roger Staubach (1971) as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to accomplish the feat.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>176 yards.</strong> Saquon Barkley put an end to anyone still doing a double take upon seeing the running back in an Eagles jersey. After Philly got off to a slow start, again failing to score in the first quarter, the Barkley-led offense soared and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671710\">demolished the Giants 28-3</a>. Barkley stuck it to his former team, rushing for 176 yards on 17 carries, and scored a touchdown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SNYGiants/status/1848114489536757927\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Saquon Barkley saw fans burning his jersey in the MetLife Stadium parking lot while he walked in today<br><br>&quot;In that moment, I was ready for 3rd and 1 - let&#39;s just say that&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/PS1rikH7vL\">pic.twitter.com/PS1rikH7vL</a></p>&mdash; Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SNYGiants/status/1848114489536757927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Barkley\u2019s monster game was the second most rushing yards for a back facing his former team. Only then-Bengal Cedric Benson\u2019s 189 yards against the Chicago Bears was better. Perhaps it was not the best idea for Giants fans to burn Barkley\u2019s jersey outside MetLife Stadium, a ritual Barkley observed upon arrival. \u201cIn that moment, I was ready for 3rd and 1 \u2013 let\u2019s just say that,\u201d he said after the game.</p> <h2><strong>Video of the week</strong></h2> <p>There are two lenses through which to view this Patrick Mahomes run that led to a touchdown: a) Look at Mahomes\u2019 vision and toughness, what a display for a guy who ran 4.80 at the combine; or b) Look at Mahomes threading the sideline knowing none of these dudes are going to tackle him since even sniffing him is an automatic penalty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1848132583734837441\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;How did he do that?!&quot;<br><br>Appropriate reaction after this Mahomes 33-yard run \ud83d\ude31<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KCvsSF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#KCvsSF</a> on FOX<br>\ud83d\udcf1: <a href=\"https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG\">https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/IVfqAtV5Qh\">pic.twitter.com/IVfqAtV5Qh</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1848132583734837441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Either way, the Super Bowl rematch was not much of a contest. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671777\">Chiefs topped the 49ers 28-18</a>, and Brock Purdy was interception prone throughout, including an awful, forced ball on third and goal with just over 4:00 remaining. The Chiefs didn\u2019t exactly dominate as Mahomes threw two interceptions of his own. But KC dialed up enough creative packages on both sides of the ball (particularly Steve Spagnuolo\u2019s defense) to stymie the Super Bowl runners-up. The Chiefs offense is not as explosive as years past but at 6-0 they\u2019re figuring out how to win.</p> <p>As for the Niners, there will surely be questions about Purdy this week, some of them valid. But the reality is the 49ers at 3-4 are dealing with a multitude of debilitating injuries, including <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41910688/san-francisco-49ers-receivers-deebo-samuel-brandon-aiyuk-exit-vs-chiefs\">a feared torn ACL</a> for receiver Brandon Aiyuk. There was one notable addition for the 49ers on Sunday though: receiver Ricky Pearsall made his NFL debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/sep/01/49ers-ricky-pearsall-in-stable-condition-after-being-shot-in-chest\">50 days after he was shot</a> in the chest. \u201cI feel like I could play another game right now,\u201d Pearsall, who had three receptions for 21 yards, said with a smile.</p> <h2><strong>Elsewhere around the league</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 The Washington Commanders had a scare as rookie sensation Jayden Daniels exited early Sunday with a rib injury. Marcus Mariota filled in admirably and led the Commanders to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671640\">a 40-7 trouncing of the Carolina Panthers</a>. The Commanders (5-2) have a narrow division lead over the Eagles (4-2) and face the Bears next week. C\u2019mon football gods, we need that Daniels-Caleb Williams faceoff.</p>    <p>\u2022 So \u2026 how did firing their head coach and then trading for Davante Adams go for the New York Jets? Not very well so far: they\u2019ve lost both games since starting their mid-season revolution. The latest came during Sunday Night Football against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with Adams catching just three of the nine throws that came his way for 30 yards in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671785\">the heavy 37-15 loss</a>. The Jets have plenty of excellent players and have lost a few close games. But a 2-5 record isn\u2019t a great look for a team that has gone all-in to win. The Steelers are in a better place at 5-2, and Russell Wilson threw two touchdown passes and ran for another in his Pittsburgh debut.</p> <p>\u2022 This is how you make a first impression:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills/status/1848074365449249169\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Amari Cooper&#39;s first catch AND first touchdown as a Buffalo Bill! <br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paramountplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@paramountplus</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CaTcKnflc9\">pic.twitter.com/CaTcKnflc9</a></p>&mdash; Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills/status/1848074365449249169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Amari Cooper\u2019s biggest fan may be Keon Coleman. Having a bona fide and threatening WR1 on the field helped Coleman have a monster day with seven targets, four receptions and 125 receiving yards in the Buffalo Bills\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671616\">34-10 win over the Tennessee Titans</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Green Bay Packers-Houston Texans didn\u2019t quite live up to the hype of its marquee billing but it was a nailbiter. New Packers kick Brandon McManus punched a 45-yarder on the game\u2019s final play to give Green Bay <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671644\">the dramatic 24-22 win</a>. Houston\u2019s offense was pulseless throughout, and the Texans were far too conservative in the game\u2019s final minutes. They were only in it thanks to Green Bay\u2019s equally bland offense and three turnovers, including two interceptions from Jordan Love.</p> <p>\u2022 All it took was Jacksonville spending the week in London for them to finally get back on track. Scoring 22 points in the second quarter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/20/fallen-patriots-wave-white-flag-in-mauling-by-hungry-jaguars\">the Jags took down the Patriots 32-16</a>. Trevor Lawrence was in command and rookie wideout Brian Thomas Jr continued his tear with 89 yards and a score. Granted, it wasn\u2019t the most powerful opponent but with the Jags at 2-5, Doug Pederson\u2019s job is safe for another week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cleveland\u2019s fanbase came into Sunday\u2019s home Browns-Bengals showdown steeped in feelings. Some of them greeted their own quarterback, Deshaun Watson, with deafening boos as he ran on to the field. If there was any doubt about how many fans feel about Watson, the same crowd showered running back Nick Chubb with cheers at an even higher decibel as he made his return from a lengthy injury layoff. Watson looks like he is headed for a lengthy period on the sidelines himself: in the second quarter, he went down with what ESPN reported is a ruptured achilles. His season is over. Possibly it\u2019s the end of Watson\u2019s career \u2013 the quarterback\u2019s play has declined and achilles injuries often leave players a shadow of their former selves. As Watson was carted off the field in tears, the feelings in Cleveland were on overdrive. For some, there was catharsis or a feeling that karma had been served. For others, there was legitimate sadness. After all, despite Watson\u2019s dismal performance as Cleveland\u2019s man under center, and the allegations against him as a man, you never want to see someone injured. Although maybe in this case, you do. Some of the Browns fans did: there were scattered cheers when Watson went down injured, a reaction Cleveland cornerback Greg Newsome II later described as \u201cbullshit\u201d. One feeling that all Browns fans can agree upon is regret. Deep regret. If Browns owner Jimmy Haslam giving Watson $230m in guaranteed money in 2022 wasn\u2019t already the worst contract in NFL history, the achilles injury on Sunday made it official. Haslam set the gold standard in how not to gift a contract. Not only by the sheer amount of guaranteed money, the most in NFL history, but by handing the franchise to a player who was almost certainly set for a lengthy suspension over those sexual misconduct allegations (the ban ended up being 11 games). Haslam\u2019s plan that Watson the player would make Watson the person palatable failed from the jump. Watson\u2019s debut didn\u2019t come until Week 13 of the 2022 season. His performance that season was meh at best. He looked nothing like the young Houston Texans quarterback who was both efficient and explosive. The Browns went 3-3 with Watson under center in 2022 and finished 7-10, last in the AFC North. Every game he played that season \u2013 with incessant boos at stadiums around the US \u2013 was also a reminder of what many thought of Watson the person. Watson\u2019s second season was cut short by a shoulder injury. Everyman hero Joe Flacco stepped in and did an admirable job but it was Cleveland\u2019s elite defense that led them to a playoff berth. Any glimmer of hope for the Browns that Watson would morph into even an above average quarterback quickly evaporated this season. Under Watson, the Browns have a 1-6 record, including Sunday\u2019s 21-14 loss to Cincinnati. He had yet to top 200 passing yards in a game this season, and was last in QBR among qualified quarterbacks. Moving on from him will be expensive too: he\u2019s guaranteed $46m a season in the final two years of his contract. There are plenty of badly run franchises in the NFL: but none of them are dumb enough to take Watson and his huge contract off the Browns\u2019 hands. So, from a football-only standpoint Watson\u2019s tumultuous time in Cleveland has been a failure. Add in the fact that he\u2019s an alleged predator, with more than 24 women accusing him of sexual misconduct and the Browns\u2019 thinking is unfathomable (Watson settled more than two dozen lawsuits involving his accusers out of court but he has never been criminally charged over the allegations). For many fans \u2013 including some in Cleveland \u2013 there is no passer rating Watson could achieve to erase the allegations that surround him. The Browns\u2019 sad and seedy Watson era is going to take time to move past, although some may not understand what that means. Jameis Winston, who hardly has a clean reputation himself, ended Sunday\u2019s game as Cleveland\u2019s quarterback. He was asked about Watson after the game. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that I had a chance to serve Deshaun, but I am very upset with the reaction to a man that has had the world against him for the past four years,\u201d said Winston. Perhaps it\u2019s worth Winston asking why the world was against Watson in the first place. MVP of the week Jared Goff, quarterback, Detroit Lions. Goff\u2019s signature play in the Lions\u2019 31-29 win over the previously undefeated Minnesota Vikings was the beautiful 35-yard touchdown strike to Amon-Ra St Brown in the closing minutes of the first half. The Lions quarterback diced Minnesota\u2019s Cover 0, shaking off the safety and evading the pass rush. Not only was it a momentum changer, it sent a reminder to Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores. Goff thrives when blitzed, unlike many of the other quarterbacks Flores\u2019 defense has terrorized. It wasn\u2019t perfect but Goff continued his hot streak Sunday. Per AP, Goff\u2019s stat line \u2013 22 for 25 for 280 yards with two touchdowns and no turnovers in his third straight game with a 140-plus passer rating \u2013 means he joined Aaron Rodgers (2011), Kurt Warner (1999) and Roger Staubach (1971) as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to accomplish the feat. Stat of the week 176 yards. Saquon Barkley put an end to anyone still doing a double take upon seeing the running back in an Eagles jersey. After Philly got off to a slow start, again failing to score in the first quarter, the Barkley-led offense soared and demolished the Giants 28-3. Barkley stuck it to his former team, rushing for 176 yards on 17 carries, and scored a touchdown. Barkley\u2019s monster game was the second most rushing yards for a back facing his former team. Only then-Bengal Cedric Benson\u2019s 189 yards against the Chicago Bears was better. Perhaps it was not the best idea for Giants fans to burn Barkley\u2019s jersey outside MetLife Stadium, a ritual Barkley observed upon arrival. \u201cIn that moment, I was ready for 3rd and 1 \u2013 let\u2019s just say that,\u201d he said after the game. Video of the week There are two lenses through which to view this Patrick Mahomes run that led to a touchdown: a) Look at Mahomes\u2019 vision and toughness, what a display for a guy who ran 4.80 at the combine; or b) Look at Mahomes threading the sideline knowing none of these dudes are going to tackle him since even sniffing him is an automatic penalty. Either way, the Super Bowl rematch was not much of a contest. The Chiefs topped the 49ers 28-18, and Brock Purdy was interception prone throughout, including an awful, forced ball on third and goal with just over 4:00 remaining. The Chiefs didn\u2019t exactly dominate as Mahomes threw two interceptions of his own. But KC dialed up enough creative packages on both sides of the ball (particularly Steve Spagnuolo\u2019s defense) to stymie the Super Bowl runners-up. The Chiefs offense is not as explosive as years past but at 6-0 they\u2019re figuring out how to win. As for the Niners, there will surely be questions about Purdy this week, some of them valid. But the reality is the 49ers at 3-4 are dealing with a multitude of debilitating injuries, including a feared torn ACL for receiver Brandon Aiyuk. There was one notable addition for the 49ers on Sunday though: receiver Ricky Pearsall made his NFL debut 50 days after he was shot in the chest. \u201cI feel like I could play another game right now,\u201d Pearsall, who had three receptions for 21 yards, said with a smile. Elsewhere around the league \u2022 The Washington Commanders had a scare as rookie sensation Jayden Daniels exited early Sunday with a rib injury. Marcus Mariota filled in admirably and led the Commanders to a 40-7 trouncing of the Carolina Panthers. The Commanders (5-2) have a narrow division lead over the Eagles (4-2) and face the Bears next week. C\u2019mon football gods, we need that Daniels-Caleb Williams faceoff. \u2022 So \u2026 how did firing their head coach and then trading for Davante Adams go for the New York Jets? Not very well so far: they\u2019ve lost both games since starting their mid-season revolution. The latest came during Sunday Night Football against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with Adams catching just three of the nine throws that came his way for 30 yards in the heavy 37-15 loss. The Jets have plenty of excellent players and have lost a few close games. But a 2-5 record isn\u2019t a great look for a team that has gone all-in to win. The Steelers are in a better place at 5-2, and Russell Wilson threw two touchdown passes and ran for another in his Pittsburgh debut. \u2022 This is how you make a first impression: Amari Cooper\u2019s biggest fan may be Keon Coleman. Having a bona fide and threatening WR1 on the field helped Coleman have a monster day with seven targets, four receptions and 125 receiving yards in the Buffalo Bills\u2019 34-10 win over the Tennessee Titans. \u2022 Green Bay Packers-Houston Texans didn\u2019t quite live up to the hype of its marquee billing but it was a nailbiter. New Packers kick Brandon McManus punched a 45-yarder on the game\u2019s final play to give Green Bay the dramatic 24-22 win. Houston\u2019s offense was pulseless throughout, and the Texans were far too conservative in the game\u2019s final minutes. They were only in it thanks to Green Bay\u2019s equally bland offense and three turnovers, including two interceptions from Jordan Love. \u2022 All it took was Jacksonville spending the week in London for them to finally get back on track. Scoring 22 points in the second quarter, the Jags took down the Patriots 32-16. Trevor Lawrence was in command and rookie wideout Brian Thomas Jr continued his tear with 89 yards and a score. Granted, it wasn\u2019t the most powerful opponent but with the Jags at 2-5, Doug Pederson\u2019s job is safe for another week.",

      "body": "<h2>Action man Jones does the lot for Slot</h2> <p>Curtis Jones\u2019s all-action display against Chelsea was all the more impressive, given that the Liverpool midfielder and his partner have a newborn daughter at home \u2013 and he slept in the spare room before Sunday\u2019s game. Called in to cover for Alexis Mac Allister, who picked up a knock on Argentina duty, Jones brought energy to Arne Slot\u2019s midfield in an outstanding box-to-box display. He kept Cole Palmer quiet, might have won two penalties with runs into the box (the second was overturned by VAR) \u2013 and was in the right place again to poke home a second-half winner. Jones\u2019s form will be a big boost for Slot with a brutal run of fixtures set to test the depth of his squad. The 23-year-old is surely overdue an England senior debut, having been part of the recent Nations League squad. Jones is the kind of dynamic midfielder Thomas Tuchel may be looking for, and more game time for Liverpool could convince the interim manager, Lee Carsley, to bed in a player he called \u201cone of the most talented I\u2019ve worked with\u201d. <strong>Niall McVeigh</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/20/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 2-1 Chelsea</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Tight margins go against O\u2019Neil again</h2> <p>The obvious topic of debate at Molineux centred on whether Bernardo Silva impeded Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1\u2019s ability to save John Stones\u2019s 95th-minute header. The officials concluded Silva had no impact on the goal and, while hugely disappointed, the first thing Gary O\u2019Neil did when he got into his manager\u2019s office was to study how Stones was able to register an effort on goal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/20/oneil-questions-big-guy-bias-after-controversial-city-goal-sinks-wolves\">O\u2019Neil acknowledged</a> the minutiae make the difference in tight games, leading him to bemoan having to substitute the 6ft 4in Wolves goalscorer J\u00f8rgen Strand Larsen, owing to fatigue. \u201cIn every game J\u00f8rgen has run his race after 60, 65 minutes,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cJ\u00f8rgen knows how important it is to get himself in better shape. Everyone thinks: \u2018It\u2019s OK, [Gon\u00e7alo] Guedes has gone on and given us energy.\u2019 But if J\u00f8rgen is on, do we concede the goal from the corner, does J\u00f8rgen help us?\u201d It was a moment that will haunt Wolves until they return to action at Brighton on Saturday. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/20/wolves-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Wolves 1-2 Manchester City</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Chelsea gain Neto positive despite defeat</h2> <p>Enzo Maresca was upbeat despite Chelsea\u2019s defeat , saying: \u201cIf you have to lose, this is probably the way you want to.\u201d The visitors had 57% possession and led Liverpool in most attacking metrics \u2013 if not the one that really mattered. A big part of Maresca\u2019s impressive start has been in finding creative consistency with a settled front four: Jadon Sancho, Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke operating behind the improving Nicolas Jackson. In Sunday\u2019s first half, Sancho had plenty of the ball but was marshalled by Trent Alexander-Arnold, leading Maresca to introduce Pedro Neto at the break. Neto also found it difficult getting in behind the Liverpool right-back, but switched up his approach, cutting infield dangerously and then playing more centrally (with Palmer on the right) when Christopher Nkunku was brought on to the left. Neto cost Chelsea \u00a354m but is yet to complete 90 minutes in the league for his new side. His invention and flexibility at Anfield should earn him more game time soon. <strong>NM</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/20/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 2-1 Chelsea</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Ghana\u2019s losses could be Bournemouth\u2019s gain</h2> <p>Antoine Semenyo, Mohammed Kudus and I\u00f1aki Williams with Jordan Ayew on the bench \u2026 it really is inexplicable that Ghana should be in serious danger of failing to qualify for the Cup of Nations. A 2-0 defeat last Sunday leaves them needing to win in Angola and then beat Niger at home to secure their place at Morocco 2025, and then only if Sudan fail to take a point from their two remaining games.

      "bodyText": "Action man Jones does the lot for Slot Curtis Jones\u2019s all-action display against Chelsea was all the more impressive, given that the Liverpool midfielder and his partner have a newborn daughter at home \u2013 and he slept in the spare room before Sunday\u2019s game. Called in to cover for Alexis Mac Allister, who picked up a knock on Argentina duty, Jones brought energy to Arne Slot\u2019s midfield in an outstanding box-to-box display. He kept Cole Palmer quiet, might have won two penalties with runs into the box (the second was overturned by VAR) \u2013 and was in the right place again to poke home a second-half winner. Jones\u2019s form will be a big boost for Slot with a brutal run of fixtures set to test the depth of his squad. The 23-year-old is surely overdue an England senior debut, having been part of the recent Nations League squad. Jones is the kind of dynamic midfielder Thomas Tuchel may be looking for, and more game time for Liverpool could convince the interim manager, Lee Carsley, to bed in a player he called \u201cone of the most talented I\u2019ve worked with\u201d. Niall McVeigh Match report: Liverpool 2-1 Chelsea Tight margins go against O\u2019Neil again The obvious topic of debate at Molineux centred on whether Bernardo Silva impeded Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1\u2019s ability to save John Stones\u2019s 95th-minute header. The officials concluded Silva had no impact on the goal and, while hugely disappointed, the first thing Gary O\u2019Neil did when he got into his manager\u2019s office was to study how Stones was able to register an effort on goal. O\u2019Neil acknowledged the minutiae make the difference in tight games, leading him to bemoan having to substitute the 6ft 4in Wolves goalscorer J\u00f8rgen Strand Larsen, owing to fatigue. \u201cIn every game J\u00f8rgen has run his race after 60, 65 minutes,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cJ\u00f8rgen knows how important it is to get himself in better shape. Everyone thinks: \u2018It\u2019s OK, [Gon\u00e7alo] Guedes has gone on and given us energy.\u2019 But if J\u00f8rgen is on, do we concede the goal from the corner, does J\u00f8rgen help us?\u201d It was a moment that will haunt Wolves until they return to action at Brighton on Saturday. Ben Fisher Match report: Wolves 1-2 Manchester City Chelsea gain Neto positive despite defeat Enzo Maresca was upbeat despite Chelsea\u2019s defeat , saying: \u201cIf you have to lose, this is probably the way you want to.\u201d The visitors had 57% possession and led Liverpool in most attacking metrics \u2013 if not the one that really mattered. A big part of Maresca\u2019s impressive start has been in finding creative consistency with a settled front four: Jadon Sancho, Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke operating behind the improving Nicolas Jackson. In Sunday\u2019s first half, Sancho had plenty of the ball but was marshalled by Trent Alexander-Arnold, leading Maresca to introduce Pedro Neto at the break. Neto also found it difficult getting in behind the Liverpool right-back, but switched up his approach, cutting infield dangerously and then playing more centrally (with Palmer on the right) when Christopher Nkunku was brought on to the left. Neto cost Chelsea \u00a354m but is yet to complete 90 minutes in the league for his new side. His invention and flexibility at Anfield should earn him more game time soon. NM Match report: Liverpool 2-1 Chelsea Ghana\u2019s losses could be Bournemouth\u2019s gain Antoine Semenyo, Mohammed Kudus and I\u00f1aki Williams with Jordan Ayew on the bench \u2026 it really is inexplicable that Ghana should be in serious danger of failing to qualify for the Cup of Nations. A 2-0 defeat last Sunday leaves them needing to win in Angola and then beat Niger at home to secure their place at Morocco 2025, and then only if Sudan fail to take a point from their two remaining games. Kudus, it\u2019s true, did not have the best return to club action, as he was sent off in West Ham\u2019s 4-1 defeat at Tottenham, but Ayew got Leicester\u2019s winner at Southampton and Semenyo was Bournemouth\u2019s most consistently dangerous player as they beat Arsenal. Twice he skinned Ben White with almost embarrassing ease, constantly cutting infield to shoot, a persistent threat. The good news for Bournemouth is that, so long he remains at the club, he should be available for next season\u2019s Christmas programme. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Bournemouth 2-0 Arsenal Mart\u00ednez worth more than sum of clean sheets Speaking on international duty last week, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez bemoaned the number of goals Aston Villa had conceded in the Premier League, with just the solitary clean sheet against Manchester United.

      "body": "<p>In 2019, a year after his band Wild Beasts had split, Tom Fleming toured his debut solo album as One True Pairing. It was, by his account, a \u201cfucking awful\u201d experience, with only a couple of well-attended shows. \u201cIt was really difficult,\u201d he admits. \u201cPutting Wild Beasts on tour was like putting an army in motion. I wanted to go back to basics. But even then, it was obvious: this is not right and I\u2019m not in any fit state.\u201d</p> <p>The baroque Kendal four-piece had gone out on a high after five brilliant albums, two of which hit the UK Top 10, three glorious farewell gigs, no animosity \u2013 they\u2019re still friends \u2013 although Fleming, who was the gruff vocal foil to the more florid Hayden Thorpe, wanted to continue. \u201cIf one person doesn\u2019t want to be there, you haven\u2019t got a quartet any more, so I think it was the right thing to do,\u201d he says in his beautifully deep Cumbrian accent, drinking the day\u2019s umpteenth black coffee on a warm October afternoon near Waterloo.</p> <p>He had no plan B, having only known band life since his teens. \u201cI loved everything about it and it felt as if I left something of myself on the stage every time we played. But it\u2019s also bad for your sanity \u2013 the travel; I had a huge problem with drinking. Where everyone else would stop, I was the last one standing. I\u2019ve had diabetes since I was nine. I was playing with fire, really, and starting to have problems with my eyesight, circulatory problems, despite being otherwise in good shape,\u201d he says, affable and matter-of-fact. \u201cHitting your mid-30s, it was like, I\u2019m not young any more and that sort of invincibility starts to thin.\u201d</p>    <p>Speaking of which, he apologises, it\u2019s time for his insulin. He lifts his black vest and injects without flinching. Despite the warning signs, he immediately launched a solo career (as did Thorpe, although guitarist Ben Little and drummer Chris Talbot have left music). The eponymous One True Pairing album was a synth-pop take on brawny US heartland rock, and an acerbic takedown of limited perceptions of the working-class culture Fleming had grown up in, as well as the cycles of violence and oblivion that culture can perpetuate. \u201cIt probably sold about 50 copies,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Come 2020, Fleming\u2019s life was in disarray. The breakup of a long relationship \u2013 \u201cpartly through my own behaviour\u201d \u2013 left him homeless. He moved back in with family and caught first-wave Covid. The pandemic quashed his fledgling solo career, though he was eligible for government support and began working as a copywriter: \u201cI spent a long time sulking and didn\u2019t quite get back to normal for a long time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It sounds a bit more serious than sulking. \u201cIt was a bit of a breakdown, to be honest,\u201d he admits. \u201cConfronting your own vulnerability is difficult. No matter how much I tell myself I wasn\u2019t hiding it, I was.\u201d His new record \u201ccomes hand in hand with that\u201d.</p> <p>Endless Rain, the second One True Pairing album, is as miraculous a return to form as anyone has ever made. Fleming recorded it in 2022 with Lankum producer John \u201cSpud\u201d Murphy, near Dublin, the electronics and US heartland stuff replaced by heavy, hymnal folk that feels lashed with saltwater, thick with earth, possessed of a thousand-yard stare into the dark of night. The voice that used to fire a rocket up your middle in Wild Beasts now seems to resonate within the belly of a vast ship. It\u2019s beautiful: melodic, profound and raw.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aagm33kSNPI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aagm33kSNPI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>One True Pairing: Frozen Food Centre \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Now 39, Fleming has often talked about how embarrassing he found the idea of making singer-songwriter music.

I saw friends having not just children, but several children, and not buying a house but buying their second, bigger house. Where did I go wrong?

      "bodyText": "In 2019, a year after his band Wild Beasts had split, Tom Fleming toured his debut solo album as One True Pairing. It was, by his account, a \u201cfucking awful\u201d experience, with only a couple of well-attended shows. \u201cIt was really difficult,\u201d he admits. \u201cPutting Wild Beasts on tour was like putting an army in motion. I wanted to go back to basics. But even then, it was obvious: this is not right and I\u2019m not in any fit state.\u201d The baroque Kendal four-piece had gone out on a high after five brilliant albums, two of which hit the UK Top 10, three glorious farewell gigs, no animosity \u2013 they\u2019re still friends \u2013 although Fleming, who was the gruff vocal foil to the more florid Hayden Thorpe, wanted to continue. \u201cIf one person doesn\u2019t want to be there, you haven\u2019t got a quartet any more, so I think it was the right thing to do,\u201d he says in his beautifully deep Cumbrian accent, drinking the day\u2019s umpteenth black coffee on a warm October afternoon near Waterloo. He had no plan B, having only known band life since his teens. \u201cI loved everything about it and it felt as if I left something of myself on the stage every time we played. But it\u2019s also bad for your sanity \u2013 the travel; I had a huge problem with drinking. Where everyone else would stop, I was the last one standing. I\u2019ve had diabetes since I was nine. I was playing with fire, really, and starting to have problems with my eyesight, circulatory problems, despite being otherwise in good shape,\u201d he says, affable and matter-of-fact. \u201cHitting your mid-30s, it was like, I\u2019m not young any more and that sort of invincibility starts to thin.\u201d Speaking of which, he apologises, it\u2019s time for his insulin. He lifts his black vest and injects without flinching. Despite the warning signs, he immediately launched a solo career (as did Thorpe, although guitarist Ben Little and drummer Chris Talbot have left music). The eponymous One True Pairing album was a synth-pop take on brawny US heartland rock, and an acerbic takedown of limited perceptions of the working-class culture Fleming had grown up in, as well as the cycles of violence and oblivion that culture can perpetuate. \u201cIt probably sold about 50 copies,\u201d he says. Come 2020, Fleming\u2019s life was in disarray. The breakup of a long relationship \u2013 \u201cpartly through my own behaviour\u201d \u2013 left him homeless. He moved back in with family and caught first-wave Covid. The pandemic quashed his fledgling solo career, though he was eligible for government support and began working as a copywriter: \u201cI spent a long time sulking and didn\u2019t quite get back to normal for a long time,\u201d he says. It sounds a bit more serious than sulking. \u201cIt was a bit of a breakdown, to be honest,\u201d he admits. \u201cConfronting your own vulnerability is difficult. No matter how much I tell myself I wasn\u2019t hiding it, I was.\u201d His new record \u201ccomes hand in hand with that\u201d. Endless Rain, the second One True Pairing album, is as miraculous a return to form as anyone has ever made. Fleming recorded it in 2022 with Lankum producer John \u201cSpud\u201d Murphy, near Dublin, the electronics and US heartland stuff replaced by heavy, hymnal folk that feels lashed with saltwater, thick with earth, possessed of a thousand-yard stare into the dark of night. The voice that used to fire a rocket up your middle in Wild Beasts now seems to resonate within the belly of a vast ship. It\u2019s beautiful: melodic, profound and raw. Now 39, Fleming has often talked about how embarrassing he found the idea of making singer-songwriter music. He had to get over it because these songs were so much more vulnerable. \u201cI went back to being 16, to the source \u2013 what do I like? I\u2019ve had an elegant moment to retire and I haven\u2019t done it, so it became about deepening my love of stuff rather than finding the next new thing.\u201d He had \u201chugely\u201d lost confidence. \u201cYou\u2019re in danger of following everything when you don\u2019t have the confidence.\u201d Fleming hopes that listeners will recognise the difference between an \u201cearnest singer-songwriter, Jack Johnson-esque thing\u201d and him channelling the American primitive guitar and new weird Americana he loved as a teenager, music whose \u201cendless mystery you can pull with very few colours on the palette. Trusting yourself to do that is really hard.\u201d Although his lyrics are poetic \u2013 lost souls teem in the rising flood water he witnessed in Cumbria in 2020 and ghosts haunt the supermarket aisles of his youth \u2013 Endless Rain is otherwise strikingly plainspoken about human frailty, doubt, depression. Fleming\u2019s consciously written lyrics sounded contrived when he recorded them; his extemporised phone memos were the most convincing. \u201cAnd here it comes again / Those old dark jaws / Clamping round my legs,\u201d he sings on I Don\u2019t Want to Do This Anymore.

She marvels that the wayward friends of her youth now have grownup jobs. How did that happen? She mines her appearances on The Chase and Michael McIntyre\u2019s The Wheel for self-deprecating laughs. A more endearing host, it would be hard to imagine. But none of this cuts deep. Likable though her stories are of mistaking a stripper for a policeman at her hen do, or of the euphemisms she uses to avoid identifying as a comedian, cumulatively it feels insubstantial, its tone of cheery self-mockery a bit unvarying. I missed the specificity of her opening 20 minutes, the \u201cyou couldn\u2019t make it up\u201d particularities of her audience members\u2019 lives and personalities \u2013 all skilfully exploited by Adam for laughs. Next to all that idiosyncrasy, Adam\u2019s account of herself on the threshold of middle age feels \u2013 well, fun, but a bit generic. \u2022 Maisie Adam: Appraisal is touring until 7 November; then 1 February until 6 March",

Let the damn players dictate the outcome of a close battled tested game.\u201d Eight-time All-Star Damian Lillard also chimed in, suggesting the WNBA was favoring the larger-market team in New York: \u201cRefs called this game like they knew the assignment in the 2nd half boy.\u201d The Liberty shot 25 free throws, while the Lynx went 7 for 8. Minnesota was called for 21 fouls to New York\u2019s 17, with All-Star forward Napheesa Collier, the WNBA\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year, fouling out. Reeve took particular issue with the foul on Alanna Smith with Minnesota holding a 60-58 lead. Stewart drove into the lane and appeared to take the shot before there was any contact. The Lynx challenged the call, but it was upheld after video review. Reeve called the contact \u201cmarginal at best\u201d. \u201cThis sucks,\u201d she said, after mentioning faulty officiating in Minnesota\u2019s loss in the 2016 WNBA finals. \u201cThis is for a championship, for both teams. Let them decide it. What contact is legal should be the same for both teams.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I live in a small, quaint old town in north-west Germany, and every day I attend four hours of German and integration lessons. I attend because I am an immigrant: I am South African, and moved to Germany three months ago, along with my German husband and our children. These classes, which will take 700 hours to complete, are a requirement of my staying here for more than a year.</p> <p>The course takes place at the local <em>Volkshochschule</em> (VHS \u2013 \u201cthe people\u2019s high school\u201d), a network of about 900 public adult education centres that offers a wide range of courses, including languages and vocational training. The schools are deeply rooted in Germany\u2019s commitment to lifelong learning and social inclusion.</p> <p>As of last month, however, Germany \u2013 having been seen in recent years as a humanitarian beacon for its track record in welcoming asylum seekers and refugees \u2013 is tightening its borders. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/10/the-end-of-schengen-germanys-new-border-controls-put-eu-unity-at-risk\">new policy</a> has sent a clear message to those seeking refuge: you are no longer welcome here. It came against the backdrop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/far-right-afd-eyes-further-electoral-gains-in-key-german-state-of-brandenburg\">massive gains for the far-right</a> Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party (AfD) in state elections, and it is hard not to see the border clampdown as part of a strategy by chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic party (SPD) to stem the AfD\u2019s momentum.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been shocked to hear people in my \u201cliberal\u201d social ambit talk about \u201cthe refugee problem\u201d \u2013 with tropes of violence, misogyny, laziness and refusing to integrate. At a recent dinner party, someone said: \u201cThe Syrian refugees are so lazy, they prefer to live off our tax money rather than work, while real Germans are homeless and sleeping under a bridge.\u201d</p> <p>In clamping down on the borders, caving into a demand from the far right, the coalition government has validated sentiments such as these. Meanwhile, in my integration class, each of us is striving, week by week, to learn German and understand the culture. Most of us want to find meaningful work and understand how we can best fit into the country we now call home. My classmates, who include qualified teachers and mechanical engineers, possess skills that are needed here.</p> <p>I learn alongside refugees, mainly from Syria and Ukraine, as well as other \u201cregular immigrants\u201d like me, from non-EU countries (the federal government covers the course fees for jobseekers, asylum seekers, and refugees, while immigrants from non-EU countries must pay). Failure to pass the language test or complete the integration course can result in difficulties in extending temporary residence permits, obtaining permanent residency or German citizenship, and in some cases, can have financial consequences, such as fines or a reduction in social benefits.</p> <p>In class, we learn about history, politics, culture and identity, with our teachers emphasising the importance of freedom, equality, tolerance and multiculturalism in German society. I see the strong commitment of German teachers and administrators doing all they can to help migrants integrate. They offer support that goes well beyond the classroom \u2013 from helping participants navigate Germany\u2019s sometimes overwhelming bureaucratic systems to intervening in domestic violence situations.</p> <p>Commitment to these principles of compassion, inclusiveness and solidarity represents what is best about German identity. Yet the rise of racism and anti-immigrant rhetoric put these very ideals in jeopardy. Our headmistress recently told our class: \u201cRacism is everywhere and Germans are racist, too. If someone hears you\u2019ve been here for nine years and you still haven\u2019t learned the language, you have no chance!\u201d She spoke to us about how she\u2019s had to handle incidents of violence in the classroom (unsurprising when you think most of the students are traumatised, having fled wars). She has had to call the police in a few times, and they advised her to install security. Her response? \u201cIf I were to do that, I would resign from this job. This is not the country I want to live in, where we live in fear, expecting the worst of people.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if many Germans ask themselves that question: what kind of country do I want to live in? My desk at home faces a beautiful 12th-century Protestant church. When I sat down at my desk, two days after the border clampdown on 26 September, I was confronted with a shocking sight. The house next to the church had been defaced overnight. In red spray paint, there was a swastika next to \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d, as well as other messages such as \u201c\u201cFuck the system\u201d. This disgraceful act is a hate crime in Germany.</p> <p>Policing all land borders will come with racial profiling and potential human rights violations. How does this sit with German values and culture, which include a strong commitment to human rights, justice and solidarity? Can the German government truly not find more effective ways to harness the country\u2019s collective knowledge and expertise to address the root causes of irregular immigration? To agree on a European solution rather than turning desperate people away? To directly address fears and concerns with data on the impact of immigration.

      "bodyText": "I live in a small, quaint old town in north-west Germany, and every day I attend four hours of German and integration lessons. I attend because I am an immigrant: I am South African, and moved to Germany three months ago, along with my German husband and our children. These classes, which will take 700 hours to complete, are a requirement of my staying here for more than a year. The course takes place at the local Volkshochschule (VHS \u2013 \u201cthe people\u2019s high school\u201d), a network of about 900 public adult education centres that offers a wide range of courses, including languages and vocational training. The schools are deeply rooted in Germany\u2019s commitment to lifelong learning and social inclusion. As of last month, however, Germany \u2013 having been seen in recent years as a humanitarian beacon for its track record in welcoming asylum seekers and refugees \u2013 is tightening its borders. The new policy has sent a clear message to those seeking refuge: you are no longer welcome here. It came against the backdrop of massive gains for the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party (AfD) in state elections, and it is hard not to see the border clampdown as part of a strategy by chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic party (SPD) to stem the AfD\u2019s momentum. I\u2019ve been shocked to hear people in my \u201cliberal\u201d social ambit talk about \u201cthe refugee problem\u201d \u2013 with tropes of violence, misogyny, laziness and refusing to integrate. At a recent dinner party, someone said: \u201cThe Syrian refugees are so lazy, they prefer to live off our tax money rather than work, while real Germans are homeless and sleeping under a bridge.\u201d In clamping down on the borders, caving into a demand from the far right, the coalition government has validated sentiments such as these. Meanwhile, in my integration class, each of us is striving, week by week, to learn German and understand the culture. Most of us want to find meaningful work and understand how we can best fit into the country we now call home. My classmates, who include qualified teachers and mechanical engineers, possess skills that are needed here. I learn alongside refugees, mainly from Syria and Ukraine, as well as other \u201cregular immigrants\u201d like me, from non-EU countries (the federal government covers the course fees for jobseekers, asylum seekers, and refugees, while immigrants from non-EU countries must pay). Failure to pass the language test or complete the integration course can result in difficulties in extending temporary residence permits, obtaining permanent residency or German citizenship, and in some cases, can have financial consequences, such as fines or a reduction in social benefits. In class, we learn about history, politics, culture and identity, with our teachers emphasising the importance of freedom, equality, tolerance and multiculturalism in German society. I see the strong commitment of German teachers and administrators doing all they can to help migrants integrate. They offer support that goes well beyond the classroom \u2013 from helping participants navigate Germany\u2019s sometimes overwhelming bureaucratic systems to intervening in domestic violence situations. Commitment to these principles of compassion, inclusiveness and solidarity represents what is best about German identity. Yet the rise of racism and anti-immigrant rhetoric put these very ideals in jeopardy. Our headmistress recently told our class: \u201cRacism is everywhere and Germans are racist, too. If someone hears you\u2019ve been here for nine years and you still haven\u2019t learned the language, you have no chance!\u201d She spoke to us about how she\u2019s had to handle incidents of violence in the classroom (unsurprising when you think most of the students are traumatised, having fled wars). She has had to call the police in a few times, and they advised her to install security. Her response? \u201cIf I were to do that, I would resign from this job. This is not the country I want to live in, where we live in fear, expecting the worst of people.\u201d I wonder if many Germans ask themselves that question: what kind of country do I want to live in? My desk at home faces a beautiful 12th-century Protestant church. When I sat down at my desk, two days after the border clampdown on 26 September, I was confronted with a shocking sight. The house next to the church had been defaced overnight. In red spray paint, there was a swastika next to \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d, as well as other messages such as \u201c\u201cFuck the system\u201d. This disgraceful act is a hate crime in Germany. Policing all land borders will come with racial profiling and potential human rights violations. How does this sit with German values and culture, which include a strong commitment to human rights, justice and solidarity? Can the German government truly not find more effective ways to harness the country\u2019s collective knowledge and expertise to address the root causes of irregular immigration? To agree on a European solution rather than turning desperate people away? To directly address fears and concerns with data on the impact of immigration. To deal with any structural issues in the east that drive voters towards the AfD? By hardening the borders and turning in on itself, Germany risks not only undermining the EU project and damaging its economy. It is also sacrificing its values. For ordinary citizens, like the staff and students at the VHS, this is not who we aspire to be. Germany faces a dangerous moment. The writing is quite literally on the wall.

      "body": "<p>Of the many bewitching bands to come out of the 1980s, Cocteau Twins were perhaps the<em> </em>most singular. A Scottish-London trio comprising Elizabeth Fraser, Robin Guthrie and Simon Raymonde, their enigmatic appeal was heightened by the fact that Fraser appeared to be singing in a language all her own, while the music \u2013 often gossamer-light and celestial \u2013 sounded like it should be pouring down cathedral walls. Each song\u2019s title was poetry in itself: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkkmfGJwCTA\">For Phoebe Still a Baby</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJwPMuWSDGE\">The Itchy Glowbo Blow</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbzCUmuI-Bg\">Sugar Hiccup</a>.</p> <p>In bassist Raymonde\u2019s memoir, he attempts, decades late, to disassemble their mysterious allure by confirming that they were, in fact, merely human. \u201cSorry to shatter illusions, but a cerebral bunch of intellectuals we were not,\u201d he writes, revealing that they gorged on the TV show <em>Rab C</em><em> Nesbitt</em>. He does, however, confirm that they were \u201cdifficult\u201d. Obstinate, too: they turned down invitations to <em>Top of the Pops</em>, passed on the opportunity to have Brian Eno produce them, and said no to writing the soundtrack to David Lynch\u2019s 1986 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/blue-velvet-review-still-inventive-sexy-and-bizarre\">Blue Velvet</a></em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What this book does best is send you back to the music</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still,<em> In One Ear</em> \u2013 so titled because 20 years ago Raymonde developed acoustic neuroma, leaving him partially deaf \u2013 is an amiably chatty book. Throughout, the author comes across as a thoroughly decent sort who can\u2019t quite believe his luck at getting to recollect at such length. He managed a fulfilling second act after Cocteau Twins split up. In 1997, following years of stifled resentments, soured love and drug problems, he set up <a href=\"https://bellaunion.com/\">Bella Union</a>, an independent record label started more as a labour of love than to get rich quick, nurturing the careers of acts such as Father John Misty and John Grant.</p> <p>Those coming to his book looking for Cocteau revelations may feel short-changed. We learn very little of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/24/elizabeth-fraser-meltdown-cocteau-twins\">Fraser</a> \u2013 which is as it should be; she always wore her enigma like Dior \u2013 and Raymonde remains earnestly polite, either a natural diplomat or else fearful of legal action. Consequently, any strife \u2013 and a career in music tends to feature strife as standard \u2013 surfaces between&nbsp;the lines. When, for example, in 1986, he went off briefly to work on a side project, Guthrie and Fraser knocked&nbsp;out another Cocteau Twins&nbsp;album, <em>Victorialand</em>, that Guthrie would subsequently claim his favourite. This made Raymonde feel like a spare wheel.</p> <p>\u201cI have never been under any illusion about my place in the Cocteau Twins\u2019 story,\u201d he writes, adding: \u201cReading interviews Robin has done since things unravelled, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking I\u2019d never been in the band. This makes me a bit sad.\u201d Elsewhere, after steering the career of American band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fleet-foxes\">Fleet Foxes</a>, he is shocked when they jump ship to Warner Records without telling him. \u201cI can\u2019t lie, it hurts like hell.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KnYw4EwYGc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6KnYw4EwYGc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KnYw4EwYGc\">Watch the video for Heaven Or Las Vegas by Cocteau Twins.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Mostly, though, this reads like a love letter to a charmed life lived through music. He offers a potted biography of his father, Ivor, a 1960s songwriter who wrote I Only Want to Be With You for Dusty Springfield, and charts his own journey through marriage, children, divorce, remarriage and Tottenham Hotspur home games. Bella Union continues to thrive, and he gently reminds you that, spare wheel or not, he<em> was</em> a part of Cocteau Twins and helped create some of their most memorable songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-5Xgw6d3h0\">Pearly-Dewdrops\u2019 Drops</a> among them. What this book does best is send you back to the music.

      "bodyText": "Of the many bewitching bands to come out of the 1980s, Cocteau Twins were perhaps the most singular. A Scottish-London trio comprising Elizabeth Fraser, Robin Guthrie and Simon Raymonde, their enigmatic appeal was heightened by the fact that Fraser appeared to be singing in a language all her own, while the music \u2013 often gossamer-light and celestial \u2013 sounded like it should be pouring down cathedral walls. Each song\u2019s title was poetry in itself: For Phoebe Still a Baby, The Itchy Glowbo Blow, Sugar Hiccup. In bassist Raymonde\u2019s memoir, he attempts, decades late, to disassemble their mysterious allure by confirming that they were, in fact, merely human. \u201cSorry to shatter illusions, but a cerebral bunch of intellectuals we were not,\u201d he writes, revealing that they gorged on the TV show Rab C Nesbitt. He does, however, confirm that they were \u201cdifficult\u201d. Obstinate, too: they turned down invitations to Top of the Pops, passed on the opportunity to have Brian Eno produce them, and said no to writing the soundtrack to David Lynch\u2019s 1986 film Blue Velvet. Still, In One Ear \u2013 so titled because 20 years ago Raymonde developed acoustic neuroma, leaving him partially deaf \u2013 is an amiably chatty book. Throughout, the author comes across as a thoroughly decent sort who can\u2019t quite believe his luck at getting to recollect at such length. He managed a fulfilling second act after Cocteau Twins split up. In 1997, following years of stifled resentments, soured love and drug problems, he set up Bella Union, an independent record label started more as a labour of love than to get rich quick, nurturing the careers of acts such as Father John Misty and John Grant. Those coming to his book looking for Cocteau revelations may feel short-changed. We learn very little of Fraser \u2013 which is as it should be; she always wore her enigma like Dior \u2013 and Raymonde remains earnestly polite, either a natural diplomat or else fearful of legal action. Consequently, any strife \u2013 and a career in music tends to feature strife as standard \u2013 surfaces between the lines. When, for example, in 1986, he went off briefly to work on a side project, Guthrie and Fraser knocked out another Cocteau Twins album, Victorialand, that Guthrie would subsequently claim his favourite. This made Raymonde feel like a spare wheel. \u201cI have never been under any illusion about my place in the Cocteau Twins\u2019 story,\u201d he writes, adding: \u201cReading interviews Robin has done since things unravelled, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking I\u2019d never been in the band. This makes me a bit sad.\u201d Elsewhere, after steering the career of American band Fleet Foxes, he is shocked when they jump ship to Warner Records without telling him. \u201cI can\u2019t lie, it hurts like hell.\u201d Mostly, though, this reads like a love letter to a charmed life lived through music. He offers a potted biography of his father, Ivor, a 1960s songwriter who wrote I Only Want to Be With You for Dusty Springfield, and charts his own journey through marriage, children, divorce, remarriage and Tottenham Hotspur home games. Bella Union continues to thrive, and he gently reminds you that, spare wheel or not, he was a part of Cocteau Twins and helped create some of their most memorable songs, Pearly-Dewdrops\u2019 Drops among them. What this book does best is send you back to the music. If Cocteau Twins always sounded exquisitely out of time, now they sound timeless. \u2022 In One Ear: Cocteau Twins, Ivor and Me by Simon Raymonde is published by Nine Eight Books (\u00a322).

      "body": "<p>King Charles has been heckled by an Indigenous Australian senator, who called for a treaty and accused the crown of stealing Aboriginal land, as he concluded a speech at Parliament House in Canberra.</p> \n<p>Charles, on a five-day visit to Australia with Queen Camilla, addressed MPs and senators in the Great Hall of Parliament House on Monday. It was a key moment of his inaugural visit to Australia as monarch.</p> \n<p>As he finished the speech \u2013 which covered his time as a school student in Australia, the Covid pandemic and Australia\u2019s vulnerability to the climate crisis \u2013 Lidia Thorpe, an independent senator from Victoria, approached the stage yelling \u201cthis is not your country\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us \u2013 our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,\u201d shouted Thorpe, who is a fiercely outspoken advocate for Indigenous rights.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. You are a genocidalist.\u201d </p> \n<p>As security officers escorted her to the doors, she shouted: \u201cThis is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king.\u201d</p> \n<p>As she left the hall and was forced back into the foyer, Thorpe, who was dressed in a long possum skin coat, could be heard shouting: \u201cFuck the colony.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charles had turned to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and talked quietly on the podium as security prevented Thorpe from approaching the monarch.</p> \n<p>Earlier, as Thorpe waited among invited guests inside the Great Hall before the royal couple entered, the senator turned her back on a large video screen when it showed King Charles standing to attention outside during the official welcome and the playing of the national anthem.</p> \n<p>Before the king\u2019s speech, Albanese and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, welcomed Charles and Camilla to Parliament House, thanking them for standing with Australians in good times and bad.</p> \n<p>Albanese called it one of the honours of his life to have led the Australian delegation attending the king\u2019s coronation and praised the king\u2019s engagement on issues including the climate crisis and reconciliation.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have shown great respect for Australians, even during times where we\u2019ve debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cNothing stands still.\u201d</p> \n<p>Former prime minister Tony Abbott, who was at the event, expressed his dismay at the protest, labelling it \u201cunfortunate political exhibitionism\u201d.</p> \n<p>Abbott is an avowed royalist, who caused widespread national outrage in 2014 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/25/knights-and-dames-reinstated-in-change-to-australias-honours-system\">reintroducing the knights and dames honours system</a> to Australia and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/feb/03/how-giving-prince-philip-a-knighthood-left-australias-pm-fighting-for-survival\">awarding the title to Prince Philip</a>.</p> \n<p>Businessman Dick Smith, another guest at the reception, said the disruption was an illustration of Australian democracy.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the wonderful part of our democracy \u2013 that she\u2019s not going to be put in jail,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Monday, Thorpe released a statement arguing that Australia should become a republic and establish treaty with First Nations people as part of that process.</p> \n<p>She said there was \u201cunfinished business that we need to resolve before this country can become a republic\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs First Peoples, we never ceded our sovereignty over this land. The crown invaded this country, has not sought treaty with First Peoples, and committed a genocide of our people. King Charles is not the legitimate sovereign of these lands. Any move towards a republic must not continue this injustice. Treaty must play a central role in establishing an independent nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Indigenous people have called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/21/what-is-an-indigenous-treaty-and-how-would-it-work-in-australia\">a treaty or treaties between Australia\u2019s governments and First Nations peoples</a> since early colonisation, with a renewed call in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/uluru-statement-from-the-heart\">2017\u2019s Uluru Statement from the Heart</a> which called for voice, treaty and truth telling.</p> \n<p>The statement resulted from a lengthy series of consultations conducted by Indigenous people in their own communities across Australia and proposes the creation of a special commission to oversee the making of agreements. The statement declares that sovereignty \u201chas never been ceded or extinguished, and coexists with the sovereignty of the Crown\u201d.</p> \n<p>There is ongoing debate about the effect of such treaties. Some state and territory governments have begun their own processes towards, treaties but the issue has not been formally progressed federally.</p> \n<p>Charles and Camilla previously greeted members of the public at the Australian War Memorial, shaking hands and high-fiving children. Among them was Hephner the alpaca, resplendent in a gold crown, bow tie and blue velvet suit, who had the chance to meet Charles.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe just thought, what an opportunity to dress him up as royalty and bring him today,\u201d said Hephner\u2019s owner, Robert Fletcher.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think this is probably the last opportunity that you\u2019ll ever get to see them, certainly in my lifetime and probably my daughter\u2019s lifetime as well,\u201d said Fletcher.</p> \n<p>ACT police said Thorpe was part of a protest group near the memorial earlier on Monday, that was directed to move on and complied.</p> \n<p>Separately, a 62-year-old man was later arrested outside the memorial for breach of the peace but released without charge, police said. Several others were arrested at the memorial and also not charged.</p> \n<p>A 21-year-old woman arrested at the memorial for allegedly failing to comply with police direction was charged and faced court on Monday afternoon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "King Charles has been heckled by an Indigenous Australian senator, who called for a treaty and accused the crown of stealing Aboriginal land, as he concluded a speech at Parliament House in Canberra. Charles, on a five-day visit to Australia with Queen Camilla, addressed MPs and senators in the Great Hall of Parliament House on Monday. It was a key moment of his inaugural visit to Australia as monarch. As he finished the speech \u2013 which covered his time as a school student in Australia, the Covid pandemic and Australia\u2019s vulnerability to the climate crisis \u2013 Lidia Thorpe, an independent senator from Victoria, approached the stage yelling \u201cthis is not your country\u201d. \u201cYou committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us \u2013 our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,\u201d shouted Thorpe, who is a fiercely outspoken advocate for Indigenous rights. \u201cYou destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. You are a genocidalist.\u201d As security officers escorted her to the doors, she shouted: \u201cThis is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king.\u201d As she left the hall and was forced back into the foyer, Thorpe, who was dressed in a long possum skin coat, could be heard shouting: \u201cFuck the colony.\u201d Charles had turned to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and talked quietly on the podium as security prevented Thorpe from approaching the monarch. Earlier, as Thorpe waited among invited guests inside the Great Hall before the royal couple entered, the senator turned her back on a large video screen when it showed King Charles standing to attention outside during the official welcome and the playing of the national anthem. Before the king\u2019s speech, Albanese and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, welcomed Charles and Camilla to Parliament House, thanking them for standing with Australians in good times and bad. Albanese called it one of the honours of his life to have led the Australian delegation attending the king\u2019s coronation and praised the king\u2019s engagement on issues including the climate crisis and reconciliation. \u201cYou have shown great respect for Australians, even during times where we\u2019ve debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cNothing stands still.\u201d Former prime minister Tony Abbott, who was at the event, expressed his dismay at the protest, labelling it \u201cunfortunate political exhibitionism\u201d. Abbott is an avowed royalist, who caused widespread national outrage in 2014 for reintroducing the knights and dames honours system to Australia and then awarding the title to Prince Philip. Businessman Dick Smith, another guest at the reception, said the disruption was an illustration of Australian democracy. \u201cThat\u2019s the wonderful part of our democracy \u2013 that she\u2019s not going to be put in jail,\u201d he said. Earlier on Monday, Thorpe released a statement arguing that Australia should become a republic and establish treaty with First Nations people as part of that process. She said there was \u201cunfinished business that we need to resolve before this country can become a republic\u201d. \u201cAs First Peoples, we never ceded our sovereignty over this land. The crown invaded this country, has not sought treaty with First Peoples, and committed a genocide of our people. King Charles is not the legitimate sovereign of these lands. Any move towards a republic must not continue this injustice. Treaty must play a central role in establishing an independent nation.\u201d Indigenous people have called for a treaty or treaties between Australia\u2019s governments and First Nations peoples since early colonisation, with a renewed call in 2017\u2019s Uluru Statement from the Heart which called for voice, treaty and truth telling. The statement resulted from a lengthy series of consultations conducted by Indigenous people in their own communities across Australia and proposes the creation of a special commission to oversee the making of agreements. The statement declares that sovereignty \u201chas never been ceded or extinguished, and coexists with the sovereignty of the Crown\u201d. There is ongoing debate about the effect of such treaties. Some state and territory governments have begun their own processes towards, treaties but the issue has not been formally progressed federally. Charles and Camilla previously greeted members of the public at the Australian War Memorial, shaking hands and high-fiving children. Among them was Hephner the alpaca, resplendent in a gold crown, bow tie and blue velvet suit, who had the chance to meet Charles. \u201cWe just thought, what an opportunity to dress him up as royalty and bring him today,\u201d said Hephner\u2019s owner, Robert Fletcher. \u201cI think this is probably the last opportunity that you\u2019ll ever get to see them, certainly in my lifetime and probably my daughter\u2019s lifetime as well,\u201d said Fletcher. ACT police said Thorpe was part of a protest group near the memorial earlier on Monday, that was directed to move on and complied. Separately, a 62-year-old man was later arrested outside the memorial for breach of the peace but released without charge, police said. Several others were arrested at the memorial and also not charged. A 21-year-old woman arrested at the memorial for allegedly failing to comply with police direction was charged and faced court on Monday afternoon.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning. With two weeks to go until the US presidential election, the race could hardly be closer. But when you\u2019re next frantically obsessing over the odds, keep in mind: it may not be as simple as who most voters want to see in the Oval Office.</p> <p>If the attempt to subvert the 2020 election was an anti-democratic horror show, its impact was somewhat mitigated by the fact that Donald Trump seemed to be making it up as he went along. This time around, Republicans are a lot more organised in their efforts to influence the outcome \u2013 and as the Maga takeover of the GOP has rolled on over the past four years, election denialism has moved from the fringes to become a central tenet of the party.</p> <p>That means the wheels are already in motion for alarming interventions before and after polling day. A case in point over the weekend: Elon Musk\u2019s plan for a daily $1m giveaway to a swing state voter who signs a petition in support of the first and second amendments, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/elon-musk-promises-to-award-1m-every-day-to-voters-as-he-steps-up-campaigning-for-trump\">legal experts say</a> could amount to an illegal inducement to register to vote.</p> <p>For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to <em><strong>Sam Levine</strong></em>, voting rights reporter for Guardian US, about the nature of the threat \u2013 and how worried you should be. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>NHS </strong></em>| The health secretary, Wes Streeting, is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/21/wes-streeting-unveils-plans-for-patient-passports-to-hold-all-medical-records\">unveil plans for portable medical records</a> giving every NHS patient all their information stored digitally in one place, despite fears over breaching privacy and creating a target for hackers. The news is part of a major consultation on the government\u2019s plans to transform the NHS from \u201canalogue to digital\u201d over the next decade.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Middle East </strong></em>| <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/20/israeli-strike-on-gaza-multi-storey-residential-building-reportedly-kills-dozens\">At least 87 people were killed</a> or missing and 40 injured after intense Israeli airstrikes hit the north of the Gaza Strip. In Lebanon, hundreds of residents fled their homes in Beirut after what appeared to be an Israeli attack on areas linked to a Hezbollah banking system.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK news</strong></em> | Tributes poured in for the Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/20/chris-hoy-tributes-pour-in-terminal-cancer-diagnosis\">after he revealed he had received a terminal cancer diagnosis</a>. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Hoy, who won six golds and one silver medal for Team GB, said doctors had told him he had between two and four years to live.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Prisons </strong></em>| <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/20/fewer-women-may-go-to-jail-in-england-and-wales-in-sentencing-review\">Fewer women could be sent to jail</a> under a review to be announced by ministers this week that is expected to cut sentences for thousands of criminals. The review is expected to be carried out by the former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Monarchy </strong></em>| King Charles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/21/king-charles-australia-visit-heckled-senator-lidia-thorpe-parliament-house-canberra\">has been heckled by an Indigenous Australian senator</a>, who called for a treaty and accused the crown of stealing Aboriginal land, as he concluded a speech at Parliament House in Canberra. Lidia Thorpe approached the stage and shouted \u201cThis is not your land. You are not my king.\u201d</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018We\u2019re getting to a place where trust in the system is eroded\u2019</h2>    <p>The crucial backdrop to Republican attempts to game the system: this is a race that could rest on a few thousand votes in a few key states. If the result comes down to a decimal place in Pennsylvania or Michigan, keeping some voters at home or throwing out a few ballots could make all the difference.</p> <p>How serious is the risk that the election will be subverted? \u201cIf we\u2019re on a 10-point scale, I\u2019d say it\u2019s about a seven,\u201d Sam Levine said. \u201cIt\u2019s short of a total meltdown. But there are some very alarming signs.\u201d</p> <p>The reason it\u2019s a seven and not a 10: \u201cThere\u2019s no legal scholar I talk to who doubts that the rightful winner of the election is going to be certified and seated. No court has successfully thrown out an election in the past, and the statutes are very clear.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, the memory of 2000\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/15/2016-election-old-voting-machines-hanging-chad\">hanging chads</a> and the heavily conservative composition of the supreme court \u2013 as well as the fact that interventions that never make it to the courts could play a significant role \u2013 mean there are good reasons to be concerned. \u201cWhen you look at all of these things together, they make a very toxic stew,\u201d Sam said.</p> <p>Here are some of the ingredients.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Trump supporters are taking control of election boards</strong></p> <p>Since 2020, more than 30 local officials have either refused to certify valid election results or threatened to do so. And while those efforts have ultimately failed so far, they signal a new era of activists seeking control of previously non-partisan bodies. In Georgia, for example, a pro-Trump majority on the state board of elections has attempted to force through dubious new rules including one that would have required the hand counting of results \u2013 a procedure that critics say slows down the results, makes them less accurate and creates a false perception of uncertainty \u2013 only to see their intervention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/georgia-election-rules-trump-board-unconstitutional\">struck down by a county judge</a> last week.</p> <p>\u201cBefore 2020, the vast majority of Americans had no idea these boards existed,\u201d Sam said. And while they are generally required to certify the results, that is likely to be challenged in November. \u201cThese local board meetings are now full of [Trump supporters] who get up and scream at the board members if they disagree with them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A study of boards in eight swing states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/swing-states-election-deniers-vote-count\">published last month</a> found there were at least 102 election deniers sitting on state and county boards. The most prominent example was again Georgia, where the 3-2 Trump majority on the state board may have been thwarted by a judge but remains in a key role ahead of what is likely to be a nail-biting race.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Republicans are signing up as \u2018poll watchers\u2019</strong></p> <p>Election boards are not the only place where Trump supporters have sought to intervene in the process. There has been a parallel effort to get those who were sceptical of the 2020 result to sign up to be poll watchers \u2013 who can challenge voters\u2019 eligibility in some states. (See <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/inside-the-republican-national-committees-poll-watching-army\">this excellent New Yorker piece</a> for more on how Trump supporters are being primed to intervene.) </p> <p>Sam points to the Election Integrity Network, founded by prominent 2020 election denialist Cleta Mitchell, which claims to have recruited tens of thousands of \u201celection integrity patriots\u201d and holds regular coordinating calls. Meanwhile, Republican national committee chair Michael Whatley claims to have recruited almost 200,000 poll watchers, poll workers, and volunteer lawyers.</p> <p>\u201cThat creates a volatile situation,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThere have been reports of counties buying panic buttons in case election workers are harassed. But there is no evidence for the claims being made.\u201d</p> <p><em>***</em></p> <p><strong>Voters have been removed from </strong><strong>electoral rolls or asked to prove their citizenship</strong></p>    <p>In Tennessee, the top election official asked 14,000 registered voters, many in areas with large ethnic minority populations, to prove their citizenship. In Alabama, the state tried to remove 3,200 people from the rolls as non-citizens before admitting that 2,000 of them were eligible. And in Texas, the governor, Greg Abbott, claimed that 6,500 non-citizens had been removed from the rolls \u2013 when in fact, almost 6,000 of them had simply failed to respond to letters from the state asking for proof.</p> <p>These states are so certain to vote Republican in November that the decisions will not directly impact the result. But, said Sam, \u201cit is part of a misinformation effort \u2013 it creates the sense that voting by non-citizens is a major problem, and that if it can happen in Texas, it can happen anywhere\u201d.</p> <p>The non-citizen voting claim also chimes with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/375253/elon-musks-nonsensical-lies-about-immigrant-voting-briefly-explained\">a debunked conspiracy theory</a> advanced by Elon Musk, among others, that Democrats are quickly making unauthorised immigrants into citizens to tilt key states in their favour. It is also seen as a way to suppress the eligible votes of those who were on the fence about turning up anyway, particularly among immigrant communities.</p> <p><em>***</em></p> <p><strong>Republicans are preparing to use the court system to challenge results</strong></p> <p>Reuters counted 130 lawsuits from Republicans relating to the election process this year. Sam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/republican-litigation-election\">describes some of those cases here</a>, ranging from challenges to absentee ballots to more claims of non-citizen votes. As he notes, such cases \u201ccan be a particularly powerful forum for spreading misleading information [because] public officials sometimes won\u2019t speak publicly about pending legal matters\u201d, meaning they go unchallenged. And they could be a preview of what follows after the election has concluded.</p> <p>Whereas in 2020, Republican party lawyers had refused to join Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the election, the party looks very different in 2024. The Republican national committee\u2019s election litigation team is now headed by Christina Bobb, a prominent 2020 election denier who is facing criminal charges over her attempts to subvert the result.</p> <p>One nightmare scenario is a situation like 2000, when the supreme court effectively decided the winner of the election. \u201cOn the one hand, in 2020, the supreme court refused to go near a case asking them to invalidate the results,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThat is reassuring \u2013 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to go chasing fringe legal theories despite their ideological leanings.\u201d</p> <p>But even then, it is possible some rightwing justices with form for this sort of thing could issue opinions that might fan the flames of any tensions, Sam said. And the court could have to decide on a more technical, narrow issue with massive ramifications. In that scenario, the outcome is harder to predict \u2013 and there will be big questions about the justices\u2019 objectivity given the court\u2019s recent turn to the right.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Even if these efforts fail, they fan the flames of denialism</strong></p> <p>As we\u2019ve seen, many of the manoeuvres outlined above have been struck down by the courts. But even these failures can be a success \u2013 because they may be understood by those who denied the 2020 result as further proof that the system is rigged against them. And even as they undertake their own work to subvert the result, Trump and many of his supporters are claiming it is the Harris campaign that is trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election.</p> <p>To his point that he expects the rightful winner to be seated, Sam adds this caveat: \u201cEven if that happens, the damage done by stoking this chaos is very, very significant. We\u2019re getting to a place where trust in the system is eroded, and many people may not accept the result.\u201d If so, the intensity of the misinformation this time around may make January 6 look like a dry run.</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Yes, the above picture of <strong>Daisy May Cooper</strong> is magnificent.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. With two weeks to go until the US presidential election, the race could hardly be closer. But when you\u2019re next frantically obsessing over the odds, keep in mind: it may not be as simple as who most voters want to see in the Oval Office. If the attempt to subvert the 2020 election was an anti-democratic horror show, its impact was somewhat mitigated by the fact that Donald Trump seemed to be making it up as he went along. This time around, Republicans are a lot more organised in their efforts to influence the outcome \u2013 and as the Maga takeover of the GOP has rolled on over the past four years, election denialism has moved from the fringes to become a central tenet of the party. That means the wheels are already in motion for alarming interventions before and after polling day. A case in point over the weekend: Elon Musk\u2019s plan for a daily $1m giveaway to a swing state voter who signs a petition in support of the first and second amendments, which legal experts say could amount to an illegal inducement to register to vote. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Sam Levine, voting rights reporter for Guardian US, about the nature of the threat \u2013 and how worried you should be. Here are the headlines. Five big stories NHS | The health secretary, Wes Streeting, is to unveil plans for portable medical records giving every NHS patient all their information stored digitally in one place, despite fears over breaching privacy and creating a target for hackers. The news is part of a major consultation on the government\u2019s plans to transform the NHS from \u201canalogue to digital\u201d over the next decade. Middle East | At least 87 people were killed or missing and 40 injured after intense Israeli airstrikes hit the north of the Gaza Strip. In Lebanon, hundreds of residents fled their homes in Beirut after what appeared to be an Israeli attack on areas linked to a Hezbollah banking system. UK news | Tributes poured in for the Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy after he revealed he had received a terminal cancer diagnosis. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Hoy, who won six golds and one silver medal for Team GB, said doctors had told him he had between two and four years to live. Prisons | Fewer women could be sent to jail under a review to be announced by ministers this week that is expected to cut sentences for thousands of criminals. The review is expected to be carried out by the former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke. Monarchy | King Charles has been heckled by an Indigenous Australian senator, who called for a treaty and accused the crown of stealing Aboriginal land, as he concluded a speech at Parliament House in Canberra. Lidia Thorpe approached the stage and shouted \u201cThis is not your land. You are not my king.\u201d In depth: \u2018We\u2019re getting to a place where trust in the system is eroded\u2019 The crucial backdrop to Republican attempts to game the system: this is a race that could rest on a few thousand votes in a few key states. If the result comes down to a decimal place in Pennsylvania or Michigan, keeping some voters at home or throwing out a few ballots could make all the difference. How serious is the risk that the election will be subverted? \u201cIf we\u2019re on a 10-point scale, I\u2019d say it\u2019s about a seven,\u201d Sam Levine said. \u201cIt\u2019s short of a total meltdown. But there are some very alarming signs.\u201d The reason it\u2019s a seven and not a 10: \u201cThere\u2019s no legal scholar I talk to who doubts that the rightful winner of the election is going to be certified and seated. No court has successfully thrown out an election in the past, and the statutes are very clear.\u201d On the other hand, the memory of 2000\u2019s hanging chads and the heavily conservative composition of the supreme court \u2013 as well as the fact that interventions that never make it to the courts could play a significant role \u2013 mean there are good reasons to be concerned. \u201cWhen you look at all of these things together, they make a very toxic stew,\u201d Sam said. Here are some of the ingredients. *** Trump supporters are taking control of election boards Since 2020, more than 30 local officials have either refused to certify valid election results or threatened to do so. And while those efforts have ultimately failed so far, they signal a new era of activists seeking control of previously non-partisan bodies. In Georgia, for example, a pro-Trump majority on the state board of elections has attempted to force through dubious new rules including one that would have required the hand counting of results \u2013 a procedure that critics say slows down the results, makes them less accurate and creates a false perception of uncertainty \u2013 only to see their intervention struck down by a county judge last week. \u201cBefore 2020, the vast majority of Americans had no idea these boards existed,\u201d Sam said. And while they are generally required to certify the results, that is likely to be challenged in November. \u201cThese local board meetings are now full of [Trump supporters] who get up and scream at the board members if they disagree with them,\u201d he said. A study of boards in eight swing states published last month found there were at least 102 election deniers sitting on state and county boards. The most prominent example was again Georgia, where the 3-2 Trump majority on the state board may have been thwarted by a judge but remains in a key role ahead of what is likely to be a nail-biting race. *** Republicans are signing up as \u2018poll watchers\u2019 Election boards are not the only place where Trump supporters have sought to intervene in the process. There has been a parallel effort to get those who were sceptical of the 2020 result to sign up to be poll watchers \u2013 who can challenge voters\u2019 eligibility in some states. (See this excellent New Yorker piece for more on how Trump supporters are being primed to intervene.) Sam points to the Election Integrity Network, founded by prominent 2020 election denialist Cleta Mitchell, which claims to have recruited tens of thousands of \u201celection integrity patriots\u201d and holds regular coordinating calls. Meanwhile, Republican national committee chair Michael Whatley claims to have recruited almost 200,000 poll watchers, poll workers, and volunteer lawyers. \u201cThat creates a volatile situation,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThere have been reports of counties buying panic buttons in case election workers are harassed. But there is no evidence for the claims being made.\u201d *** Voters have been removed from electoral rolls or asked to prove their citizenship In Tennessee, the top election official asked 14,000 registered voters, many in areas with large ethnic minority populations, to prove their citizenship. In Alabama, the state tried to remove 3,200 people from the rolls as non-citizens before admitting that 2,000 of them were eligible. And in Texas, the governor, Greg Abbott, claimed that 6,500 non-citizens had been removed from the rolls \u2013 when in fact, almost 6,000 of them had simply failed to respond to letters from the state asking for proof. These states are so certain to vote Republican in November that the decisions will not directly impact the result. But, said Sam, \u201cit is part of a misinformation effort \u2013 it creates the sense that voting by non-citizens is a major problem, and that if it can happen in Texas, it can happen anywhere\u201d. The non-citizen voting claim also chimes with a debunked conspiracy theory advanced by Elon Musk, among others, that Democrats are quickly making unauthorised immigrants into citizens to tilt key states in their favour. It is also seen as a way to suppress the eligible votes of those who were on the fence about turning up anyway, particularly among immigrant communities. *** Republicans are preparing to use the court system to challenge results Reuters counted 130 lawsuits from Republicans relating to the election process this year. Sam describes some of those cases here, ranging from challenges to absentee ballots to more claims of non-citizen votes. As he notes, such cases \u201ccan be a particularly powerful forum for spreading misleading information [because] public officials sometimes won\u2019t speak publicly about pending legal matters\u201d, meaning they go unchallenged. And they could be a preview of what follows after the election has concluded. Whereas in 2020, Republican party lawyers had refused to join Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the election, the party looks very different in 2024. The Republican national committee\u2019s election litigation team is now headed by Christina Bobb, a prominent 2020 election denier who is facing criminal charges over her attempts to subvert the result. One nightmare scenario is a situation like 2000, when the supreme court effectively decided the winner of the election. \u201cOn the one hand, in 2020, the supreme court refused to go near a case asking them to invalidate the results,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThat is reassuring \u2013 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to go chasing fringe legal theories despite their ideological leanings.\u201d But even then, it is possible some rightwing justices with form for this sort of thing could issue opinions that might fan the flames of any tensions, Sam said. And the court could have to decide on a more technical, narrow issue with massive ramifications. In that scenario, the outcome is harder to predict \u2013 and there will be big questions about the justices\u2019 objectivity given the court\u2019s recent turn to the right. *** Even if these efforts fail, they fan the flames of denialism As we\u2019ve seen, many of the manoeuvres outlined above have been struck down by the courts. But even these failures can be a success \u2013 because they may be understood by those who denied the 2020 result as further proof that the system is rigged against them. And even as they undertake their own work to subvert the result, Trump and many of his supporters are claiming it is the Harris campaign that is trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election. To his point that he expects the rightful winner to be seated, Sam adds this caveat: \u201cEven if that happens, the damage done by stoking this chaos is very, very significant. We\u2019re getting to a place where trust in the system is eroded, and many people may not accept the result.\u201d If so, the intensity of the misinformation this time around may make January 6 look like a dry run. What else we\u2019ve been reading Yes, the above picture of Daisy May Cooper is magnificent. But Rhik Samadder\u2019s spooky interview for Saturday magazine \u2013 about her riotous new book detailing her obsession with the paranormal, and, er, the time she tried to have sex with a ghost \u2013 gives it a run for its money. Features a decent anecdote about Martin Kemp mistaking the spirit of a 16th-century maid for an extra. Archie A symbol of environmental destruction and excess, megayachts are a status symbol for billionaires. For New York Magazine, Charlotte Cowles asked a former stewardess what it\u2019s really like serving the ultra-wealthy on their private floating resorts. Nimo Today\u2019s Guardian leader advises Rachel Reeves to abandon the infamous fiscal rules, and offers an alternative approach: publish an overview of the government\u2019s balance sheet and show how ministerial decisions have affected national income instead. Archie Ashifa Kassam takes a look at how Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, a survivor at the centre of a horrifying mass rape trial that has rocked France, has propelled conversations around sexual violence in countries around the world. Nimo Keira Knightley, David Walliams, Meghan Markle, and Keith Richards have something in common that they really shouldn\u2019t: they\u2019re all celebrity children\u2019s authors. Ella Creamer and Lucy Knight hear from their less famous rivals, who are unsurprisingly sick of it. Archie Sport Cycling | After the news of Olympic cycling great Sir Chris Hoy\u2019s terminal cancer diagnosis, the Guardian\u2019s cycling columnist William Fotheringham writes that Hoy\u2019s response is typical of \u201ca grounded individual who always seemed to come to a stoical, humble accommodation with the things that life dealt him, good and bad; he is a man of frankly outlandish determination\u201d. Football | Leaked WhatsApp messages from the former Newcastle United minority co-owner Amanda Staveley suggest that Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, was heavily involved in the takeover of the club, it has been reported. The messages also spotlighted the extent of the UK government\u2019s involvement. Football | Curtis Jones\u2019s 51st minute winner was enough to secure a 2-1 victory for Liverpool over Chelsea and return Arne Slot\u2019s side to the top of the Premier League. Earlier on Sunday, Manchester City took a dramatic 2-1 win over bottom side Wolves thanks to John Stones\u2019s injury time header.

Her fanbase is young, mostly female, with a sizeable contingent of gay men, and thus liberal-leaning. The more of them she can motivate to actually vote in a highly gendered election, the worse for Donald Trump. Faintly surreal as it sounds, Swift has become a powerful rallying point for liberal resistance to \u201calt-right\u201d misogyny in an election that has the free world holding its breath.</p> <p>Taylor Swift isn\u2019t just a pop star now. She is the convergence of celebrity with the kind of soft power \u2013 who else could get Yousafzai,<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgee8qgey2eo/\"> two future kings </a>and what feels like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/17/bridget-phillipson-unaware-cabinet-minister-who-declined-free-taylor-swift-tickets\">half the British cabinet</a> to her London gigs? \u2013 that has acquired harder edges this summer.</p> <p>For power like this has consequences. She had enraged the Maga movement long before <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/taylorswift/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/?hl=en\">formally endorsing Harris/Walz</a> and praising their stance on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. For months, she\u2019s been the focus of increasingly deranged <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/02/taylor-swift-op-super-bowl/677365/\">deep state conspiracy theories</a>, suggesting she\u2019s a front for some kind of fiendishly complex plot to rig the election that, like all conspiracy theories, is funny only until some lunatic believes it.</p> <p>The office has not always been a comfortable place for Swift lately. In the middle of July, an American man who had allegedly made threats against her on social media <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/taylor-swift-eras-tour-gelsenkirchen-germany-stalker-arrested-b1171552.html\">was arrested </a>in the German city of Gelsenkirchen<strong> </strong>on his way to her show, for which he had a ticket.</p>    <p>Less than a fortnight later, three little girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in the English town of Southport, in an attack whose motive remains unknown. (Swift met some of the survivors privately in London this summer.) In August, the singer cancelled <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnvy7p4n4e9o/\">three concerts in Vienna</a>, after Austrian police disrupted a suspected Islamist terror plot to kill what they called \u201ca huge number of people\u201d. It was a grim echo of the 2017 bombing at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/22/manchester-arena-police-explosion-ariana-grande-concert-england\">an Ariana Grande gig</a> in Manchester where 22 people died.</p> <p>Frankly, I don\u2019t blame her mother-turned-manager for getting spooked in London, and reportedly insisting on the kind of blue-light police escort between hotel and stadium normally reserved for heads of state. Nor do I think it was simply the lure of free gig tickets that prompted the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, and London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to take an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/14/taylor-swift-police-escort-claims-how-much-of-a-problem-is-this-for-labour\"> interest in Swift\u2019s protection </a>and the viability of an event worth around \u00a3300m to the capital.</p> <p>Still, the resulting deeply silly row allowed editors to run huge pictures of Swift in spangly knickers for days on end, only finally jumping the shark when<strong> </strong>Boris Johnson<strong> </strong>(of all people) <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-13950995/BORIS-JOHNSON-Labour-venal-corrupt-Taylor-Swifts-mum-look-like-banana-republic.html\">used it to accuse</a> Keir Starmer of looking corrupt.</p> <p>Had the prime minister secretly hoped a bit of her stardust would rub off on him, when he was <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/keir-starmer-makes-campaign-pitstop-at-taylor-swift-eras-concert-with-stars-spotted-in-crowd-13157036\">photographed at a Swift gig?</a> Probably. Will he be trying that sort of thing again now? Almost certainly not. If Taylor Swift gets a peerage or a PPE contract, I\u2019ll let you know. Sometimes, we seem like a very, very small island. Meanwhile, Swift is back at the office, temporarily boosting Florida\u2019s GDP and trying to get a black woman elected as president.</p> <p>When Time magazine chose the 34-year-old singer-songwriter as its <a href=\"https://time.com/6342806/person-of-the-year-2023-taylor-swift/\">Person of the Year</a> in 2023, its profile suggested her power lay in giving women and girls \u201cconditioned to accept dismissal, gaslighting, and mistreatment from a society that treats their emotions as inconsequential\u201d permission to believe those feelings actually matter, through her songs. A year later, she is asking them to make their feelings matter through their votes. A gentle reminder that if music is to change the world, it\u2019s never going to do so by itself.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Faintly surreal as it sounds, Swift has become a powerful rallying point for liberal resistance to \u201calt-right\u201d misogyny in an election that has the free world holding its breath. Taylor Swift isn\u2019t just a pop star now. She is the convergence of celebrity with the kind of soft power \u2013 who else could get Yousafzai, two future kings and what feels like half the British cabinet to her London gigs? \u2013 that has acquired harder edges this summer. For power like this has consequences. She had enraged the Maga movement long before formally endorsing Harris/Walz and praising their stance on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. For months, she\u2019s been the focus of increasingly deranged deep state conspiracy theories, suggesting she\u2019s a front for some kind of fiendishly complex plot to rig the election that, like all conspiracy theories, is funny only until some lunatic believes it. The office has not always been a comfortable place for Swift lately. In the middle of July, an American man who had allegedly made threats against her on social media was arrested in the German city of Gelsenkirchen on his way to her show, for which he had a ticket. Less than a fortnight later, three little girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in the English town of Southport, in an attack whose motive remains unknown. (Swift met some of the survivors privately in London this summer.) In August, the singer cancelled three concerts in Vienna, after Austrian police disrupted a suspected Islamist terror plot to kill what they called \u201ca huge number of people\u201d. It was a grim echo of the 2017 bombing at an Ariana Grande gig in Manchester where 22 people died. Frankly, I don\u2019t blame her mother-turned-manager for getting spooked in London, and reportedly insisting on the kind of blue-light police escort between hotel and stadium normally reserved for heads of state. Nor do I think it was simply the lure of free gig tickets that prompted the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, and London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to take an interest in Swift\u2019s protection and the viability of an event worth around \u00a3300m to the capital. Still, the resulting deeply silly row allowed editors to run huge pictures of Swift in spangly knickers for days on end, only finally jumping the shark when Boris Johnson (of all people) used it to accuse Keir Starmer of looking corrupt. Had the prime minister secretly hoped a bit of her stardust would rub off on him, when he was photographed at a Swift gig? Probably. Will he be trying that sort of thing again now? Almost certainly not. If Taylor Swift gets a peerage or a PPE contract, I\u2019ll let you know. Sometimes, we seem like a very, very small island. Meanwhile, Swift is back at the office, temporarily boosting Florida\u2019s GDP and trying to get a black woman elected as president. When Time magazine chose the 34-year-old singer-songwriter as its Person of the Year in 2023, its profile suggested her power lay in giving women and girls \u201cconditioned to accept dismissal, gaslighting, and mistreatment from a society that treats their emotions as inconsequential\u201d permission to believe those feelings actually matter, through her songs. A year later, she is asking them to make their feelings matter through their votes. A gentle reminder that if music is to change the world, it\u2019s never going to do so by itself.

There is up to eight times more media coverage of the climate crisis relative to biodiversity loss, but Alexandre Antonelli, the director of science at Kew\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens in London, believes a shift is occurring. \u201cEvery company leader and politician I talk to today, from many countries and backgrounds, seems to recognise the urgency of halting biodiversity loss, and appears genuinely interested in doing something concrete about it. This wasn\u2019t the case five years ago.\u201d For many, Cop16 is an opportunity for global leaders to meet and compare their proposed actions to protect biodiversity. So far, governments have never met any of their self-imposed targets on nature loss, and experts say that must change urgently. There is \u201cno time to waste\u201d, says Mike Hoffman, ZSL\u2019s head of wildlife recovery. \u201cWe cannot just sit by and document loss; we have to act, working with governments, other NGOs, the private sector and communities, to disrupt that trajectory of loss.\u201d Key issues to be discussed at Cop16 include whether wealthy countries will meet their target of contributing a minimum of $20bn annually for low and middle-income countries by 2025, as well as all nations outlining their domestic targets to protect biodiversity \u2013 less than 20% had done so ahead of the meeting. Oliver believes the root causes of biodiversity loss lie in our worldviews \u2013 and this is also where he believes the solutions will be. Changing the \u201cjuggernaut\u201d of destruction means changing the way our economy is run and how the education system works, right down to our mindsets and the way we see ourselves as \u201clocked into this degradation\u201d. \u201cI think the only way we can start to address that mass extinction is if we have more humility in our relationship as part of just one other species in the web of life,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have lost that bedrock of pro-nature values \u2026 We need to restore that so we don\u2019t have this casual attitude to ecocide.\u201d Nature restoration not a \u2018nice to have\u2019 Many governments are failing to prioritise nature restoration. In August, a study found that butterflies, bees and bats were among wildlife being boosted by the UK\u2019s nature-friendly farming schemes. The following month it was revealed the Labour government would be slashing the nature-friendly farming budget in England by \u00a3100m to help fill what ministers say is a \u00a322bn shortfall. Prof Rob Brooker, head of ecological sciences at the James Hutton Institute, says it is frustrating to see governments deprioritise nature conservation because of financial constraints. \u201cBiodiversity is not a \u2018nice to have\u2019 \u2013 it is a critical element of delivering action on climate change, health and wellbeing, and sustainable food production,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout action, our planet will be further depleted in the decades to come. We will have more hungry people living in a world with a less stable climate, and more extreme weather events.\u201d Prof Rick Stafford from Bournemouth University, who is chair of the British Ecological Society policy committee, says he has watched the decline of key species he studies in his own lifetime. He first went diving with sharks on the reefs of Indonesia 20 years ago. Now, \u201cthey\u2019ve completely vanished, not just in Indonesia but other places\u201d. Their absence is the \u201cnew normal\u201d, he says, but it can have cascading effects for marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are important fish nurseries and help feed more than 500 million people worldwide. Stafford agrees that biodiversity is not just \u201ca \u2018nice to have\u2019 thing\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s actually an essential thing,\u201d he says. He says people don\u2019t understand the urgency of it. \u201cWe are very close to those sort of critical limits where we are not going to be able to recover that biodiversity, and it has really big effects on society \u2013 it is not just about being able to see some butterflies.\u201d \u2022 Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features",

      "bodyText": "New drivers under 21 in the UK should be banned from carrying passengers of a similar age for six months after passing their test, a motoring organisation has urged. The AA estimated that introducing a graduated driving licence (GDL) would save at least 58 lives and prevent 934 people being seriously injured in road crashes each year. The AA would like to see motorists with a \u201cG\u201d graduated driver plate handed six penalty points for not wearing a seatbelt, which would mean they lose their licence. Graduated driving licensing is already used in several countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and Sweden. Department for Transport (DfT) figures show 290 people were killed and 4,669 seriously injured in crashes on Britain\u2019s roads last year in incidents involving at least one driver between 17 and 24 years old. The AA\u2019s chief executive, Jakob Pfaudler, said: \u201cNot only is this a tragic waste of life, but it contributes to the burden of high insurance premiums for young drivers. These premiums should fall when there is evidence of a reduction of young drivers and passengers killed and seriously injured. \u201cGraduated driver licensing has been proven in other countries to significantly reduce road deaths and serious injuries. We are calling on the transport secretary to make simple, pragmatic changes to the licensing process so young people are better protected in their first few months of independent driving.\u201d Under the Conservative government, the DfT announced in July 2019 it was considering introducing GDL in England, but the assessment was halted in autumn 2020, partly because of the potential impact on young people\u2019s employment. The most popular element of the AA\u2019s proposal, according to an online survey of 10,566 of its members, was passenger restrictions, with 33% of respondents saying they would support them. Last week, the senior coroner for north-west Wales, Kate Robertson, raised concerns about young, newly qualified drivers carrying passengers after an inquest into the deaths of four teenagers who drowned when their car rolled into a ditch on a trip to Snowdonia in November last year. Crystal Owen, whose son Harvey was one of them, told the Sunday Times that a ban could have saved their lives. She said she had subsequently learned that graduated licences existed in other countries. \u201cI thought: \u2018What the hell is going on?

These could have been bought by the HAFF and fast-tracked for social housing. Instead, those ready-to-go housing lots were bought by another developer with the same interests in drip-feeding new homes to maximise their returns rather than minimise housing prices.</p> \n<p>Like many proposals before it, the BCA focuses on things like removing taxes from property owners. One proposed tax change is to reduce withholding taxes on foreign investors for build-to-rent projects, which is a puzzle if ever I\u2019ve seen one. Why exactly do we need tax breaks for foreigners when they have demonstrated they are happily already investing in these projects?</p> \n<p>The BCA\u2019s proposal to remove stamp duty and replace it with a land value tax is a popular one, but they neglect important trade-offs. Not only is stamp duty an economic stabiliser, taxing more in a boom and less in a bust, the lower transaction volumes can also benefit renters. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2024/mar/06/greens-mp-warns-political-class-is-set-for-reckoning-with-screwed-over-renters-video\">Australian tenants</a> are more likely to move because their landlord sells than to move for a job. New Zealand has no stamp duty and sees higher rates of forced moves by tenants due to landlord sales.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, it\u2019s basic arithmetic that workers and their families entering the country to help build homes need more housing than they can build with their own labour time. A cynic might suggest that the BCA proposal to import more trade workers is designed to reduce the bargaining power that construction workers have at this high demand point in the property cycle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eda32ff8-f6ff-488c-a570-bc5785636507\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F00prVkwhOE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Lastly, we always forget one hugely important policy setting in the country that is right now designed to get fewer homes built, not more.</p> \n<p>Since April 2022, Australia\u2019s central bank, the RBA, like others globally, decided that the inflation pulse must be tamed. With a record 240,000 dwellings under construction in Australia at that point, the best mechanism to do that was to make buying and building homes more difficult by raising the cash rate from 0.1% to 4.35%, quickly tripling mortgage rates from about 2% to about 6%.</p> \n<p>It has worked to a degree, but even in June 2024 more than 220,000 homes were still under construction in Australia.</p> \n<p>The housing shortage, crisis, or whatever term you want to use, is part of a global cycle. Yes, there are massively unequal effects from rapidly rising rents and prices on households across the country, and we should support these households. But removing taxes on property owners and spending billions not building homes is probably not the best way to help. When inflation falls and interest rates decline, home building will rise again, even without new tax breaks and subsidies.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Dr Cameron Murray is chief economist of Fresh Economic Thinking</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia has more and larger dwellings per person than ever. But you wouldn\u2019t know it from the public conversation about housing. Like we do every economic cycle, we misinterpret a short-term asset-pricing cycle for a long-term trend and shortage of physical homes. After all, the widely claimed shortage is global and suddenly emerged as prices boomed post-Covid. The Business Council of Australia (BCA) is the most recent group to leverage the idea of a shortage of homes to push a reform agenda. The BCA wants to \u201csay yes to housing\u201d. So do I. Yet I find it puzzling that they define the problem as a lack of home building, but propose spending billions subsidising infrastructure and removing taxes from property owners rather than spending those billions directly building homes. When then prime minister Kevin Rudd wanted more homes built after the 2008 financial crisis, he gave $6bn to state public housing agencies, creating our last public housing construction boom. When we need homes for the military, we have the Defence Housing Authority build new homes where and when they are needed. The Housing Australia Future Fund could have spent a fraction of those funds on buying approved but stalled housing projects. Lendlease last year sold a portfolio of 27,600 undeveloped new housing lots in existing estates. These could have been bought by the HAFF and fast-tracked for social housing. Instead, those ready-to-go housing lots were bought by another developer with the same interests in drip-feeding new homes to maximise their returns rather than minimise housing prices. Like many proposals before it, the BCA focuses on things like removing taxes from property owners. One proposed tax change is to reduce withholding taxes on foreign investors for build-to-rent projects, which is a puzzle if ever I\u2019ve seen one. Why exactly do we need tax breaks for foreigners when they have demonstrated they are happily already investing in these projects? The BCA\u2019s proposal to remove stamp duty and replace it with a land value tax is a popular one, but they neglect important trade-offs. Not only is stamp duty an economic stabiliser, taxing more in a boom and less in a bust, the lower transaction volumes can also benefit renters. Australian tenants are more likely to move because their landlord sells than to move for a job. New Zealand has no stamp duty and sees higher rates of forced moves by tenants due to landlord sales. Meanwhile, it\u2019s basic arithmetic that workers and their families entering the country to help build homes need more housing than they can build with their own labour time. A cynic might suggest that the BCA proposal to import more trade workers is designed to reduce the bargaining power that construction workers have at this high demand point in the property cycle. Lastly, we always forget one hugely important policy setting in the country that is right now designed to get fewer homes built, not more. Since April 2022, Australia\u2019s central bank, the RBA, like others globally, decided that the inflation pulse must be tamed. With a record 240,000 dwellings under construction in Australia at that point, the best mechanism to do that was to make buying and building homes more difficult by raising the cash rate from 0.1% to 4.35%, quickly tripling mortgage rates from about 2% to about 6%. It has worked to a degree, but even in June 2024 more than 220,000 homes were still under construction in Australia. The housing shortage, crisis, or whatever term you want to use, is part of a global cycle. Yes, there are massively unequal effects from rapidly rising rents and prices on households across the country, and we should support these households. But removing taxes on property owners and spending billions not building homes is probably not the best way to help. When inflation falls and interest rates decline, home building will rise again, even without new tax breaks and subsidies. \u2022 Dr Cameron Murray is chief economist of Fresh Economic Thinking",

      "bodyText": "Homebuyers in Victoria will save tens of thousands of dollars in stamp duty on off-the-plan apartments, townhouses and units bought in the next 12 months, under a state government initiative aimed at stimulating development. The premier, Jacinta Allan, on Monday announced the policy, which came into effect immediately and was open to all buyers \u2013 including investors \u2013 for properties at any price point. She said the idea came from a series of meetings she held with industry, in which they told her interest rate rises had slowed sales of new developments, preventing them from beginning. By making it easier for people to buy off-the-plan, Allan said she expected developers would be able to finance requirements faster and start the construction of new homes sooner. \u201cIt will mean more buyers into the market and it will get those projects [under way] sooner,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cWhether you want to live in an apartment, a unit or a townhouse \u2013 it provides more opportunities for more Victorians to be able to find a home where they want to live.\u201d Prior to the announcement, first home buyers did not have to pay stamp duty on new or established properties worth $600,000 or less, with a reduced rate charged for properties worth up to $750,000. Stamp duty discounts were also available for non-first home buyer owner occupiers who bought a new or existing homes valued at up to $550,000. The government said under the new policy, the amount of stamp duty paid would be calculated based on the cost of the land prior to construction, not the total price of the finished property. It estimated this would cut the stamp duty paid on a new, off-the-plan $620,000 apartment to just $4,000 \u2013 a saving of $28,000. The treasurer, Tim Pallas, said the concession would cost the government about $55m over the 12 months and was designed to be a short-term intervention at a \u201cdifficult\u201d time for the sector. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cMaking sure we facilitate developers having a level of comfort that they can proceed to [begin] these projects, I think, is in everybody\u2019s interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWill we see examples of projects being mooted but not ultimately realised? Yes, of course we will, it\u2019s the nature of the industry. But this, once again, facilitates projects being able to [begin], and we should see less of that.\u201d. Pallas said it was his expectation material costs and interest rates would be \u201cmodestly\u201d lower within a year. While he said the state\u2019s tax settings \u201care not chiseled in granite\u201d, he ruled out major wholesale changes to stamp duty, given it makes up a third of the state\u2019s taxation revenue. \u201cStamp duty raises about $8bn dollars a year, and the state would not be able to deliver its services without a revenue base of that magnitude,\u201d Pallas said. To be eligible for the concession, apartments, townhouses and units must be in strata subdivision \u2013 meaning they retain common property such as a driveway or a shared hallway. House and land packages or other dwellings that are not part of a strata subdivision are not eligible \u2013 though the government said the existing concession on these properties would continue. A parliamentary inquiry last year found stamp duty was \u201cinefficient, unpredictable and inequitable\u201d but would be difficult to scrap entirely without affecting the state\u2019s service delivery. It instead called for a national reform of stamp duty to \u201cbetter address its negative impact on housing affordability, economic mobility and market efficiency, for more Australians\u201d. It\u2019s a view shared by Jonathan O\u2019Brien from Yimby Melbourne, who welcomed the Victorian government\u2019s policy but urged federal intervention. \u201cThis policy threads the needle: it makes new supply more abundant and more affordable, by tackling one of the worst taxes in the state,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cNow is the time for the Albanese government to take meaningful action and support Victoria in abolishing stamp duty altogether, in favour of a broad-based land tax.\u201d The Property Council and the Urban Development Institute of Australia also welcomed the announcement, respectively describing it as a \u201cbig step in the right direction\u201d and a \u201cgood start\u201d. It is the second significant policy measure by the Allan government in what is expected to be a week of announcements that aim to provide Victorians with more affordable housing options. On Sunday, the government announced a plan to seize planning controls in 50 inner-Melbourne areas located near public transport, including the affluent, Liberal-held electorates of Brighton, Hawthorn and Malvern, to allow for greater density. Allan on Monday said the suburbs had lacked development due to a \u201cnimby-style\u201d approach from \u201cLiberals, conservative politicians\u201d in the electorate, who had \u201cchased local votes and blocked the building of more homes in their community\u201d. She said it was only \u201cfair\u201d to help \u201cyounger Victorians\u201d who were \u201clocked out of being able to afford or buy a home\u201d where they grew up. \u201cThey\u2019re being denied choice and opportunity, and that is not fair, and they need someone in their corner fighting for them,\u201d Allan said.",

It was the first time that Wardaniyah had been targeted by Israel, but was the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on buildings hosting displaced people in parts of Lebanon thought to be safe and that have otherwise not seen any fighting. </p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to go somewhere safe, where there is no bombing, war or [militias], so we came here. Why did they strike here? We don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ali Daher, a 36-year-old mine clearance operator who was displaced from Tyre, south Lebanon, on 30 September. He held out his fractured wrist and pointed to his one-year-old son Kareem\u2019s arm, which had been bandaged after a piece of debris tore it open.</p> <p>The effects are also being felt in Lebanese society, where local officials have said the fear of strikes have inflamed tensions between members of the country\u2019s many sects and the largely Shia Muslim displaced, who they are afraid to welcome. Unconfirmed rumours of Hezbollah fighters hiding among the displaced have proliferated, despite the vast majority of displaced them being civilians.</p> <p>More than 1.2 million people have been displaced in Lebanon over the last year, most of them since 23 September, when Israel escalated its aerial campaign over wide swathes of the country. Many have sought shelter in Christian and Druze-majority areas that had previously been spared Israeli bombing.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still terrified, I can barely hear out of my ears. We\u2019re so tired. I\u2019ve started taking pills for my nerves,\u201d Daher said, wincing as a massive boom rippled out, the sound of an Israeli jet breaking the sound barrier amplified by the town\u2019s high elevation. \u201cWait for the next one,\u201d he said while Kareem waited in his stroller, a single finger pointed to the sky in anticipation of the second sonic boom.</p> <p>Lebanon\u2019s painful history of sectarian violence, with a 15-year civil war being fought from 1970 between a dizzying, constantly shifting patchwork of sectarian alliances, has made the spectre of renewed intercommunal fighting especially concerning.</p> <p>In most cases, like the strike on Monday in Christian-majority Aitou, north Lebanon, which killed 21 living in a residential building rented to displaced people, there have been no other strikes on the area. Similarly, a strike on Baadaran on 28 September, in the Druze-majority Chouf district, which killed eight people, was the only time Israel has struck the town.</p> <p>The single deadliest strike in Lebanon since the war started was on Ain el Delb, outside Saida, killing 71 people on 29 September after displaced families moved into an apartment block. It was the first time that the town came under Israeli fire.</p> <p>Israel has not yet commented on any of the strikes on buildings hosting displaced people, but has previously said that its military operation in Lebanon is intended to target Hezbollah fighters, installations and weapons caches.</p>    <p>Ali Breem, the mayor of Wardaniyah, said the purpose of such strikes on the displaced was to \u201csow terror\u201d and to make people afraid of the displaced. The multi-faith town of about 5,000 residents has hosted more than 8,000 people since 23 September.</p> <p>\u201cThey are hitting a village which is supposed to be safe. Even if there was a military target, if there as someone visiting family in Badaraan or otherwise, they could have waited and hit them in another place,\u201d Breem said. He said the airstrike had not affected Wardaniyah residents\u2019 willingness to host people fleeing Israeli bombardment.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Israeli military again struck Wardaniyah, bombing a home after issuing a warning to residents of the town to distance themselves from what it said was a Hezbollah installation. No one was injured in the strike, and though the town\u2019s residents and the displaced fled in anticipation of the strike, almost all had returned by the weekend. </p> <p>In Achrafieh, the majority-Christian neighbourhood of east Beirut, groups of men have donned uniforms and begun nightly patrols, armed with batons.</p> <p>A neighbourhood watch programme, which had been discontinued in the summer of 2023, was revived on 5 October amid a feeling of \u201crising insecurity\u201d among residents, according to Akram Nehme, an administrator of Achrafieh 2020 which runs the initiative.</p> <p>Nehme said the restarting of night patrols had nothing to do with the influx of displaced people, but had been planned for some months prior. The programme, which relies on donations from Achrafieh\u2019s residents, had suddenly received an influx of funding.</p> <p>Unlike in most other areas of Beirut, where displaced families line up outside communal kitchens and sleep on pavements, there are no people sleeping rough on Achrafieh\u2019s streets. In private, many residents saythey are scared to host people from south Lebanon or the southern suburbs of Beirut, for fear their presence might bring an Israeli bomb down on the neighbourhood.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a very big concern for us. If one building is targeted in Achrafieh, it will be an issue.

The UK prime minister is due to visit the small Pacific island state for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm), which starts on Monday. At the summit, leaders will elect the new secretary general for the Commonwealth to replace Patricia Scotland, the former Labour cabinet minister, who has been in post since 2016. All three candidates to succeed her have called for reparations for countries that were affected by slavery and colonialism. The UN judge Patrick Robinson concluded last year that the UK owed more than \u00a318tn in reparations for its historical involvement in slavery in 14 countries. Successive UK governments have resisted calls for reparations. Downing Street sought to shut down the discussion before the Commonwealth summit this week by saying that reparations were \u201cnot on the agenda\u201d. The government has also ruled out making a formal apology this week. But five Labour MPs told the Guardian that the UK should be open to discussing reparatory justice for its former colonies. Caricom, a group of 15 Caribbean countries, is expected to push Starmer and the foreign secretary, David Lammy, on the issue in Samoa. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill, said: \u201cThe UK has both a moral and legal duty to address the injustices of the past. If reparations is on the agenda for Commonwealth countries then the UK government must be willing to discuss it. Refusing to address our role speaks volumes about the regard in which we hold people who still live with the impact of enslavement and colonialism.\u201d Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East, said: \u201cWe should be responsible enough to confront our nation\u2019s history and the legacy it continues to leave today. That should start with opening up a dialogue with those countries whose wealth we extracted, about the impact of colonialism and slavery on their society and how the wrongs of the past can be righted.\u201d Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, said: \u201cYou\u2019d like to think on the eve of going into the Commonwealth meeting, a new Labour government would be looking to have a better and closer relationship with those countries \u2026 David Lammy is a son of the Caribbean, from Guyana.

Lammy is the son of Guyanese immigrants and was a champion for justice for the Windrush generation in the UK. He has said in the past that \u201chard truths\u201d need to be told about slavery. A Commonwealth spokesperson said: \u201cThe Commonwealth has historically facilitated frank conversations about difficult issues that have resulted in positive outcomes. Reparatory justice, which is more than just about reparations, may be discussed at Chogm, if any government proposes it. If so, the heads of government will decide how the discussions will proceed.\u2019\u201d As the meeting in Samoa approaches, the Commonwealth, which was created from the ashes of the British empire, faces bigger questions about its usefulness as an association. Summit attendance by heads of government has declined. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, are set to snub this week\u2019s meeting in favour of the BRICS summit in Russia. Scotland has been a divisive secretary general \u2013 critics have accused her of cronyism, and a group of countries, including the UK, unsuccessfully attempted to remove her in 2022. Pat Conroy, Australia\u2019s minister for the Indo-Pacific, told the Guardian the meeting was \u201can opportunity for the Commonwealth to demonstrate its relevance to its members\u201d and that it had on occasion \u201cspread itself too thin\u201d. There is nervousness among larger Commonwealth states about whether Samoa, a tiny country of 200,000 people, will be able to successfully pull off the summit \u2013 which is King Charles\u2019s first as head of the Commonwealth. Organisers have chartered cruise ships to house attenders, given the islands\u2019 limited tourist infrastructure. The hotel due to host the king has received a reported \u00a380,000 from the government for renovations, and the UK, Australia and New Zealand are supporting Samoa with security arrangements.

HRT is one of the most common treatments for menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, mood swings, poor sleep and vaginal dryness. It can also help maintain muscle strength and prevent osteoporosis. But a 10-year study of nearly 2 million women in England has found worrying inequalities in women\u2019s access to HRT. Academics at the University of Oxford examined HRT prescriptions issued in England to 1,978,348 women aged 40 to 60 over a 10-year period. Findings presented at the World Congress on Menopause in Melbourne on Monday revealed that between 2013 and 2023, almost six times as many white women were prescribed HRT than black women, and more than twice as many women in affluent areas were offered HRT than those living in socially deprived areas.

Dr Sue Mann, the NHS national clinical director for women\u2019s health, said it was vital that all women had equal access to support and were fully informed about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options for menopause, including HRT. \u201cWe know there is more work to do to increase awareness and reduce inequalities in access, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re rolling out women\u2019s health hubs to provide extra care within communities, as well as tools to help women to manage their symptoms,\u201d she said. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2024 to replace the top image with one that better reflected the story.",

If his argument sounds familiar it is because his work is \u2013 at least partly \u2013 funded by anti-abortion Christian groups in the US and draws heavily on their messaging and methods. Rai\u2019s preaching comes at a time when providers of women\u2019s healthcare around the world are preparing for potentially disastrous consequences should Donald Trump win the US presidential election in November. When he last took office in 2017, one of his first acts was to reinstate, and later expand, an order known as the Mexico City policy. US law has long prohibited the use of foreign aid for abortions, but the policy also bars foreign organisations that receive US family planning funds from providing advice on abortion services or advocating for the liberalisation of abortion laws, even if they do so using funds from other sources. Trump greatly expanded the policy so it applies to any organisation receiving US healthcare funding. Foreign organisations wishing to access this funding must sign up to the policy, which is often referred to as the global gag rule (GGR) because of the restrictions it places on organisations to even discuss the option of abortion. Nepal first legalised abortion in 2002 and today women have the right to an abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy and in limited circumstances up to 28 weeks. The legalisation of abortion has been credited with contributing to a 72% fall in maternal mortality rates \u2013 from 539 deaths for every 100,000 live births in 1996 to 151 in 2022. Those gains are being put at risk by the GGR, say experts. A study on the impact of the policy in Nepal by the Center for Research on Environment, Health and Population Activities (Crehpa), a Nepali organisation, found that it had \u201ccreated a major obstacle to improving women\u2019s lives\u201d, in particular among \u201cmarginalised and underserved populations\u201d. Since the GGR was first introduced by Ronald Reagan in 1984, successive Republican administrations have imposed it, while the Democrats have revoked it, leaving family planning organisations such as MSI Nepal (formerly Marie Stopes International) \u2013 which refuses to sign it \u2013 caught in a cycle of funding and defunding. The consequences have been dire, says Tushar Niroula, the executive director of MSI Nepal. \u201cYou can\u2019t strengthen the health system in four years and then stop for four years. Next time you have to start from scratch.\u201d Niroula says his organisation had to shut down projects soon after the Trump administration took office, due to cuts in funding. \u201cThere was a huge gap overnight,\u201d he says. The prospect of a Trump victory in November is already hampering MSI Nepal\u2019s work. Members of a consortium bidding for US healthcare funding have been reluctant to collaborate with MSI Nepal because its refusal to sign the GGR could put the whole bid at risk, says Niroula. \u201cUS government funding is huge and extends for five to six years, which is enough time to build systems and make them sustainable. That is why the global gag rule is such a barrier,\u201d he says. Puja Karki sees what is at stake every day in her role as team leader at MSI Nepal\u2019s clinic in Pokhara, a city about a three-hour drive from Beni. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for a woman to come here, it takes guts,\u201d says Karki. \u201cSome communities do not accept family planning and they believe abortion is wrong. Pre-marital sex is not acceptable, so unmarried women are afraid of taking up the service.\u201d Karki says a combination of social stigma, lack of awareness and difficulties accessing family planning services puts women at severe risk. Some turn to \u201cunsafe and unauthorised places for abortion\u201d, says Karki, or attempt to abort themselves using traditional herbs or a sharpened stick. While there is limited accurate and recent data, a study by Crehpa estimated that in 2014 almost 60% of abortions in Nepal were carried out illegally, meaning they took place at unapproved facilities in potentially unsafe conditions. Another study put the figure at 52% in 2021. \u201cThe main challenge is they lack awareness of abortion in rural areas. They do not know how to access proper services,\u201d says Karki. \u201cMany are not even aware that abortion is legal.\u201d That challenge is only likely to grow under a second Trump presidency, but that does not seem to concern Rai. Although he says he does explain the law in his talks, he adds that if Nepali women do not know that abortion is legal, \u201cthat is good news for me\u201d. Asked if he would prefer Donald Trump to win the election, Rai replies, \u201cOf course.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The first time I encountered Leeroy Thornhill, he invited me around to his place to smoke banana skins. I was only 12 years old at the time \u2013 but before you call social services, let me reassure you that this wasn\u2019t a real-life interaction. I was simply reading the sleeve notes of his band the Prodigy\u2019s debut album, Experience, where the peculiar fruit-based invitation was offered up to the band\u2019s fans. Just above it was a photograph of the group sharing a joint. They seemed thrillingly above the law \u2013 and the rules of being in a band itself.</p> <p>For a start, half of them \u2013 Thornhill and his best mate, Keith Flint \u2013 were employed as dancers. A third member, Maxim, was a vocalist who didn\u2019t seem to appear on half the songs, which left only Liam Howlett to make all the music, a furious collision of breakbeats, helium vocals and space-age synthesisers. It was the kind of outfit you might dream up after a night smoking, well, banana skins. Did they actually do that?</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d laughs Thornhill, when we speak via video link from his home in Essex. \u201cMany other things, but not those.\u201d He ponders his band\u2019s corrupting influence on junior listeners such as myself. \u201cWe\u2019d have been about 21 at that time. At that age, you\u2019re so far away from the mindset of a 12-year-old. We were just thinking about playing parties. But, as time went on, we\u2019d notice that kids \u2013 13, 14 years old \u2013 would be sleeping under cars outside our hotel just so they could meet us. We started to realise that <em>everyone</em> liked it.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, as the Prodigy developed, they found themselves appealing not just to ravers but rock fans and festival crowds, too. For the decade Thornhill was in the band (he left in 2000), they went from playing live shows at messy nightclubs in Essex to touring the world and reinventing the idea of how big a dance act could be. The story is told in Thornhill\u2019s new book, Wildfire, which collects hundreds of photographs he has saved \u2013 taken by himself, his sister and a couple of others. It\u2019s like a trip back in time \u2013 sweatbox venues, ludicrously baggy outfits, not a phone in sight \u2013 and plenty of evidence that the band and their fans had the time of their lives. Flint in particular stands out with his wide-eyed mugging for the camera.</p>    <p>The whole thing is a testament to the 90s, when the world felt a little more carefree, hedonistic and ripe with possibilities. Alongside the pictures is a timeline of the band and some comedy anecdotes. You shouldn\u2019t, however, mistake it for a tell-all memoir. There\u2019s no airing of dirty laundry here. And given that it sticks to Thornhill\u2019s time in the band, there\u2019s only the briefest reference to Flint\u2019s death in 2019 (\u201cHe left us way too early but his star will always burn bright,\u201d it reads). Today, though, he will be more forthcoming \u2013 not just about his friend, but the pressures all men face as they grow older.</p> <p>Thornhill grew up in Rayne, Essex, and it was through partying in nearby Braintree that he got to know Flint \u2013 the pair hit it off immediately. \u201cWe were like a little comedy duo right from the off, making a joke out of everything.\u201d After being introduced to the \u201creally shy\u201d Howlett \u2013 and discovering that the music he was making himself was even better than the stuff they were dancing to in the clubs \u2013 they asked him how he\u2019d feel about putting together a live show with them fronting the operation as energetic dancers.</p> <p>The aim wasn\u2019t really to start a band. It was just about getting up on stage. At the time, Thornhill had no idea what he wanted to do with his life, although he\u2019d done his electrician qualifications. \u201cMy mum was in the Caribbean when I told her that I\u2019d joined a band. She said: \u2018Oh good, that\u2019s going to pay the rent,\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. The thing was, paying the rent wasn\u2019t the reason they were doing it. They were more interested in being young and immersing themselves in dance culture.</p> <p>Clubs were where Thornhill felt at home. He grew up as \u201cone of 10 black people in a community of 25,000\u201d, and, as he was 6ft 6in tall, he spent a lot of his time \u201ctrying to stay in the background so I didn\u2019t get shit all the time\u201d.</p>    <p>Trouble was not his thing. \u201cWe had mates who\u2019d say they were going to go and do some car stereos, but we\u2019d just be like: \u2018We\u2019re off.\u2019\u201d Thornhill remembers going to local clubs where he\u2019d sit and watch groups of people he knew throwing chairs at each other\u2019s heads, \u201clike it was a western!\u201d But the places he preferred to frequent were only about good vibes and dancing. A huge fan of James Brown, he developed his own fast-paced style of foot shuffling.</p> <p>The band\u2019s live gigs were wild. During a sold-out show in Folkestone, one ticketless fan was so desperate to get inside that he jumped headfirst through a window pane. Thornhill remembers looking up and seeing a shadow coming towards him \u2013 the fan hadn\u2019t realised that the venue floor was actually three storeys below. He landed on their equipment and was carted off to hospital. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s up to now?\u201d Thornhill says. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be too hard to find him, he\u2019s probably got the mixer buttons still imprinted in the side of his face.\u201d</p> <p>As the band gatecrashed the charts, purists sniffed that they were selling out the rave scene. The band members found it funny, though \u2013 whenever they released a track anonymously on a white label, those same purists would send it to No 1 in the dance charts. But in truth the Prodigy soon outgrew the scene they came from: Howlett\u2019s love of hard-edged hip-hop production and raucous punk energy helped them broaden their fanbase with songs such as Poison and Their Law. When Flint spiked his hair and became a kind of nightmarish, dancefloor version of Johnny Rotten, spitting out the lines to their hit Firestarter, the band went stratospheric.</p> <p>Thornhill remembers how the glare of the spotlight fixed itself upon Flint: \u201cWe could walk through an airport unrecognised, but he\u2019d be getting angry because he had to have his own security guard. He couldn\u2019t go shopping or do anything really. He\u2019d have people camping outside his door \u2013 when he opened his curtains there\u2019d be people sitting on his wall.\u201d</p>    <p>One summer, the band were sitting in Flint\u2019s back garden, smoking a joint, when a guy walked around the side of the house with four kids and started pointing at Flint. \u201cIt was like he was in a zoo! This guy was saying: \u2018There he is, there\u2019s the firestarter!\u2019 We were trying to hide the joints from the kids and looking at each other, like, this is not right. But Keith ended up going into his house to try and find some photos for them to take home. That\u2019s what he was like, bless him.\u201d</p> <p>Thornhill says he was amazed by how well Flint dealt with the pressure. And although there are some tales in the book of Flint sulking or \u2013 on one occasion \u2013 losing his temper so badly he ripped the phones from several hotel room walls, Thornhill is adamant there were no outward signs that he was ever struggling with his mental health. </p> <p>Flint was a thrill-seeker \u2013 he loved snowboarding and in later years owned his own motorcycle racing team, Team Traction Control. Thornhill says the rest of the band always half-expected a call one day to say that he had done something reckless, like \u201cfalling off the side of a mountain or coming off his bike\u201d. In the book, Thornhill recounts the time when, while they were stoned on a private plane, the pilot invited them all to have a go flying it. Flint sent them shooting upwards into the sky. \u201cWe were all freaking out, shouting: \u2018Get him back here!\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>But Flint had another side. After his death, the singer James Blunt <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallagher-damon-albarn-paul-weller-mean-james-blunt-keith-flint-gent-2457288\">recounted an experience</a> at the Q awards where Noel Gallagher, Paul Weller and Damon Albarn were all publicly shunning him. \u201cKeith Flint came over, gave me a hug, and said how thrilled he was for my success,\u201d Blunt said. Thornhill\u2019s mum thought the same. \u201cShe\u2019d always say: \u2018He was such a sweet, lovely guy\u2019, you know what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>Flint\u2019s death did, of course, hit Thornhill hard. \u201cI love him and I always will. We\u2019ve been to 70 countries, met royalty, seen the coolest things on the planet. So of course we\u2019re sad and heartbroken.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Flint\u2019s death that has contributed to this outlook, but the experience of many of his mates. \u201cA lot of my friends have said, \u2018Oh, I thought about killing myself\u2019 and, you know, I kind of reached that point once myself.\u201d</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone prepares men for middle age. When they get to their 40s or 50s and they\u2019ve got families, people don\u2019t explain to them about the pressures, about how everything will crumble if anything happens to them. A lot of the world rests on men\u2019s shoulders but we don\u2019t hear about that. It\u2019s an age where people think they should be getting ready to retire and enjoy themselves, but instead they\u2019re having to get an extra job on Saturday and working from 5am.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/14/keith-flint-remembered-by-richard-russell\">Keith Flint remembered by Richard Russell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thornhill says his mates all check in on each other if anyone\u2019s been feeling down. \u201cThere\u2019s the old English stereotype of the man being the rock and you don\u2019t talk about your problems \u2013 but you have to communicate.\u201d</p> <p>When the Prodigy were at their late-90s peak, the African National Congress wrote to them asking if they would play in South Africa.

      "bodyText": "The first time I encountered Leeroy Thornhill, he invited me around to his place to smoke banana skins. I was only 12 years old at the time \u2013 but before you call social services, let me reassure you that this wasn\u2019t a real-life interaction. I was simply reading the sleeve notes of his band the Prodigy\u2019s debut album, Experience, where the peculiar fruit-based invitation was offered up to the band\u2019s fans. Just above it was a photograph of the group sharing a joint. They seemed thrillingly above the law \u2013 and the rules of being in a band itself. For a start, half of them \u2013 Thornhill and his best mate, Keith Flint \u2013 were employed as dancers. A third member, Maxim, was a vocalist who didn\u2019t seem to appear on half the songs, which left only Liam Howlett to make all the music, a furious collision of breakbeats, helium vocals and space-age synthesisers. It was the kind of outfit you might dream up after a night smoking, well, banana skins. Did they actually do that? \u201cNo!\u201d laughs Thornhill, when we speak via video link from his home in Essex. \u201cMany other things, but not those.\u201d He ponders his band\u2019s corrupting influence on junior listeners such as myself. \u201cWe\u2019d have been about 21 at that time. At that age, you\u2019re so far away from the mindset of a 12-year-old. We were just thinking about playing parties. But, as time went on, we\u2019d notice that kids \u2013 13, 14 years old \u2013 would be sleeping under cars outside our hotel just so they could meet us. We started to realise that everyone liked it.\u201d Indeed, as the Prodigy developed, they found themselves appealing not just to ravers but rock fans and festival crowds, too. For the decade Thornhill was in the band (he left in 2000), they went from playing live shows at messy nightclubs in Essex to touring the world and reinventing the idea of how big a dance act could be. The story is told in Thornhill\u2019s new book, Wildfire, which collects hundreds of photographs he has saved \u2013 taken by himself, his sister and a couple of others. It\u2019s like a trip back in time \u2013 sweatbox venues, ludicrously baggy outfits, not a phone in sight \u2013 and plenty of evidence that the band and their fans had the time of their lives. Flint in particular stands out with his wide-eyed mugging for the camera. The whole thing is a testament to the 90s, when the world felt a little more carefree, hedonistic and ripe with possibilities. Alongside the pictures is a timeline of the band and some comedy anecdotes. You shouldn\u2019t, however, mistake it for a tell-all memoir. There\u2019s no airing of dirty laundry here. And given that it sticks to Thornhill\u2019s time in the band, there\u2019s only the briefest reference to Flint\u2019s death in 2019 (\u201cHe left us way too early but his star will always burn bright,\u201d it reads). Today, though, he will be more forthcoming \u2013 not just about his friend, but the pressures all men face as they grow older. Thornhill grew up in Rayne, Essex, and it was through partying in nearby Braintree that he got to know Flint \u2013 the pair hit it off immediately. \u201cWe were like a little comedy duo right from the off, making a joke out of everything.\u201d After being introduced to the \u201creally shy\u201d Howlett \u2013 and discovering that the music he was making himself was even better than the stuff they were dancing to in the clubs \u2013 they asked him how he\u2019d feel about putting together a live show with them fronting the operation as energetic dancers. The aim wasn\u2019t really to start a band. It was just about getting up on stage. At the time, Thornhill had no idea what he wanted to do with his life, although he\u2019d done his electrician qualifications. \u201cMy mum was in the Caribbean when I told her that I\u2019d joined a band. She said: \u2018Oh good, that\u2019s going to pay the rent,\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. The thing was, paying the rent wasn\u2019t the reason they were doing it. They were more interested in being young and immersing themselves in dance culture. Clubs were where Thornhill felt at home. He grew up as \u201cone of 10 black people in a community of 25,000\u201d, and, as he was 6ft 6in tall, he spent a lot of his time \u201ctrying to stay in the background so I didn\u2019t get shit all the time\u201d. Trouble was not his thing. \u201cWe had mates who\u2019d say they were going to go and do some car stereos, but we\u2019d just be like: \u2018We\u2019re off.\u2019\u201d Thornhill remembers going to local clubs where he\u2019d sit and watch groups of people he knew throwing chairs at each other\u2019s heads, \u201clike it was a western!\u201d But the places he preferred to frequent were only about good vibes and dancing. A huge fan of James Brown, he developed his own fast-paced style of foot shuffling. The band\u2019s live gigs were wild. During a sold-out show in Folkestone, one ticketless fan was so desperate to get inside that he jumped headfirst through a window pane. Thornhill remembers looking up and seeing a shadow coming towards him \u2013 the fan hadn\u2019t realised that the venue floor was actually three storeys below. He landed on their equipment and was carted off to hospital. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s up to now?\u201d Thornhill says. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be too hard to find him, he\u2019s probably got the mixer buttons still imprinted in the side of his face.\u201d As the band gatecrashed the charts, purists sniffed that they were selling out the rave scene. The band members found it funny, though \u2013 whenever they released a track anonymously on a white label, those same purists would send it to No 1 in the dance charts. But in truth the Prodigy soon outgrew the scene they came from: Howlett\u2019s love of hard-edged hip-hop production and raucous punk energy helped them broaden their fanbase with songs such as Poison and Their Law. When Flint spiked his hair and became a kind of nightmarish, dancefloor version of Johnny Rotten, spitting out the lines to their hit Firestarter, the band went stratospheric. Thornhill remembers how the glare of the spotlight fixed itself upon Flint: \u201cWe could walk through an airport unrecognised, but he\u2019d be getting angry because he had to have his own security guard. He couldn\u2019t go shopping or do anything really. He\u2019d have people camping outside his door \u2013 when he opened his curtains there\u2019d be people sitting on his wall.\u201d One summer, the band were sitting in Flint\u2019s back garden, smoking a joint, when a guy walked around the side of the house with four kids and started pointing at Flint. \u201cIt was like he was in a zoo! This guy was saying: \u2018There he is, there\u2019s the firestarter!\u2019 We were trying to hide the joints from the kids and looking at each other, like, this is not right. But Keith ended up going into his house to try and find some photos for them to take home. That\u2019s what he was like, bless him.\u201d Thornhill says he was amazed by how well Flint dealt with the pressure. And although there are some tales in the book of Flint sulking or \u2013 on one occasion \u2013 losing his temper so badly he ripped the phones from several hotel room walls, Thornhill is adamant there were no outward signs that he was ever struggling with his mental health. Flint was a thrill-seeker \u2013 he loved snowboarding and in later years owned his own motorcycle racing team, Team Traction Control. Thornhill says the rest of the band always half-expected a call one day to say that he had done something reckless, like \u201cfalling off the side of a mountain or coming off his bike\u201d. In the book, Thornhill recounts the time when, while they were stoned on a private plane, the pilot invited them all to have a go flying it. Flint sent them shooting upwards into the sky. \u201cWe were all freaking out, shouting: \u2018Get him back here!\u2019\u201d But Flint had another side. After his death, the singer James Blunt recounted an experience at the Q awards where Noel Gallagher, Paul Weller and Damon Albarn were all publicly shunning him. \u201cKeith Flint came over, gave me a hug, and said how thrilled he was for my success,\u201d Blunt said. Thornhill\u2019s mum thought the same. \u201cShe\u2019d always say: \u2018He was such a sweet, lovely guy\u2019, you know what I mean?\u201d Flint\u2019s death did, of course, hit Thornhill hard. \u201cI love him and I always will. We\u2019ve been to 70 countries, met royalty, seen the coolest things on the planet. So of course we\u2019re sad and heartbroken.\u201d It\u2019s not just Flint\u2019s death that has contributed to this outlook, but the experience of many of his mates. \u201cA lot of my friends have said, \u2018Oh, I thought about killing myself\u2019 and, you know, I kind of reached that point once myself.\u201d Really? \u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone prepares men for middle age.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump visited a McDonald\u2019s franchise in Pennsylvania on Sunday, working the drive-thru and manning the fryer while he answered questions from reporters. The former president took a moment to boast about his time in office and sarcastically congratulated Kamala Harris on her 60th birthday. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get her some fries,\u201d Trump said. The visit was meant to be a jab at opponent Harris, who worked at the fast food chain while at college. Trump has frequently called that experience into question, without providing any evidence. Harris celebrated her birthday at two churches in Georgia, continuing her campaign\u2019s \u201csouls to the polls\u201d push to reach Black voters through religious communities. The Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Tim Walz, visited churches in Michigan and Minnesota while Donald Trump and backer Elon Musk held separate town halls in Pennsylvania. Both campaigns are focused on rallying support from voters in the battleground states, 16 days before an election that polls suggest is still on a knife-edge. Here\u2019s what else happened on Sunday: Kamala Harris election news Kamala Harris celebrated her 60th birthday visiting two community churches in Georgia. The first congregation sang Happy Birthday as Harris took the stage, while Stevie Wonder joined Harris and sang Bob Marley\u2019s Redemption Song at the second visit. Harris spoke about how religious experiences in her youth in Oakland, California, influenced her politics, addressing the congregation of the New Birth Missionary Baptist church in Atlanta. Drawing on the parable of the Good Samaritan in the Gospel of Luke, the vice-president argued for policies that embrace compassion. \u201cWhat kind of country do we want to live in \u2013 a country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and justice? \u2026 When we come across our brothers and sisters in need, let us, as the Good Samaritan did, see, in the face of a stranger, a neighbour.\u201d Walz, attending a church service in Saginaw, Michigan, slammed Trump for selling branded Bibles. \u201cWe understand in our faith, the Bible is to be read and followed and absorbed. It\u2019s not to be branded and sold for $59,\u201d Walz said, telling the crowd he felt \u201cpretty uncomfortable with this idea\u201d. Harris is not planning to campaign with Joe Biden ahead of the election. The decision was mutual, anonymous Harris campaign and White House officials told NBC News. The president will instead help Harris by leveraging his longtime political relationships. \u201cThe most important role he can play is doing his job as president,\u201d a White House official said. Harris sat down with the Rev Al Sharpton in a one-on-one interview in Atlanta on MSNBC\u2019s PoliticsNation, where she discussed the latest polling suggesting a slide in her support from Black men. \u201cThis narrative about what kind of support we are receiving from Black men that is just not panning out in reality,\u201d she said. \u201cI must earn the vote of everyone regardless of their race or gender.\u201d Donald Trump election news Trump doubled down on his dangerous rhetoric labelling Democrats as \u201cenemies from within\u201d during an interview with Howard Kurtz on Fox News, broadcast on Sunday.

Similar comments made by Trump in the past weeks have sparked concern and raised fears of an authoritarian crackdown if he were to become president again. Trump repeated his statement that the January 6 attack on the Capitol was a \u201cday of love\u201d during the same interview with Fox News. Asked whether he was comfortable calling January 6 a \u201cday of love\u201d, Trump responded: \u201cThey came down to protest a rigged election \u2026 you have the right to protest in this country.\u201d Earlier he had said \u201cthere was a beauty to it and a love to it\u201d, repeating comments he made at a recent town hall in Miami. Trump held a town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, his second rally in the battleground state this weekend. The former ESPN anchor Sage Steele moderated as Trump took questions from the audience. Asked whether he would protect social security and Medicare benefits, Trump listed his priorities as \u201cno tax on social security for our seniors, that\u2019s a big deal \u2026 no tax on tips [and] no tax on overtime\u201d. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X, hosted a town hall in Pittsburgh in support of Trump.

Justice Michael Lee ruled on Monday that three test cases should receive $30,000, $40,000 and $100,000. They suffered varying amounts of \u201cnon-economic loss\u201d, the court ruled, which refers to hardship and distress caused by the airline. Many workers will also be able to claim economic losses, linked to lost wages. Lee ordered Qantas and the Transport Workers\u2019 Union into mediation using the test-case amounts to inform a total payout, with the parties due to report back early next month. He found that the workers would have been retrenched one year later in 2021 anyway due to the airline\u2019s \u201claser-like\u201d focus on cutting costs, capping the economic component of compensation calculations. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The federal court found the outsourcing move to be illegal because it acted against protections in the Fair Work Act and was in part driven by a desire to avoid industrial action. Qantas unsuccessfully appealed against the decision to the full bench of the court and later the high court. About 20 former Qantas workers were in the court room to hear the judgment in Sydney on Monday, where Lee noted the extreme cost of the proceedings and use of court resources. \u201cVast legal costs have been expended, and particularly by Qantas, who have retained no less than five senior counsel during the course of the matter and numerous solicitors from one of Australia\u2019s pre-eminent law firms,\u201d Lee said. Qantas had previously made a provision of $70m in its accounts to meet any liabilities. Transport Workers\u2019 Union national assistant secretary Nick McIntosh said the total compensation bill would likely exceed $100m. The union was also seeking penalties to be imposed on Qantas in addition to a compensation payout. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said Qantas needed to prove it has \u201cturned over a new leaf\u201d. \u201cAfter relentlessly prolonging this case and denying workers justice, Qantas must do everything in its power to ensure appropriate compensation to workers,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cThey should not have to suffer a day longer after the last four years of anguish.\u201d The Qantas chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, said in a statement the airline would \u201cwork to expedite the payments\u201d. \u201cWe sincerely apologise to our former employees who were impacted by this decision and we know that the onus is on Qantas to learn from this,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe recognise the emotional and financial impact this has had on these people and their families. We hope that this provides closure to those who have been affected.\u201d Compensation hearings leading up to the judgment focused on what would have occurred if the illegal outsourcing did not occur. The court also heard that some of the workers had suffered significant psychological distress after losing their jobs and had to take medication to cope. Former Qantas worker Damien Pollard said outside court that over the last four years he had taken hundreds of calls from colleagues \u201cthat are going through personal problems and mental health issues\u201d caused by Qantas\u2019 actions. He said the court\u2019s decision \u201cgoes some way to facilitating a little bit of recovery from all that and hopefully allowing for us to move on with our lives\u201d. Australia\u2019s biggest airline emerged from the pandemic disruptions to post record profits but its reputation was tarnished by a string of scandals that precipitated the early retirement of its chief executive Alan Joyce. This month the federal court approved a regulator-imposed penalty on Qantas of $100m for selling thousands of tickets for already-cancelled flights.",

      "bodyText": "And so a culture-changing season in the WNBA comes to a close. Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese dominated the headlines during the season, but we\u2019re ending with a dramatic finale that showcased the depth of talent in the league. Bryan Armen Graham was on the scene: That\u2019s a wrap. Next up in women\u2019s sports: the NWSL playoffs, coming up soon. What was the betting line on her winning instead of Stewart or Ionescu? Thoroughly deserved. The Bahamian-born center is overcome with emotion. Not something she expected, even after that performance. Clara Wu Tsai of the Liberty\u2019s board of governors notes that the team was formerly playing before 2,000 fans a game in Westchester County. Now they\u2019re in the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. They\u2019re doing pretty well now. Meanwhile, two of the players\u2019 daughters are playing in the confetti next to the trophy. In the end, it\u2019s a gritty, gutsy performance from the Liberty. Sabrina Ionescu couldn\u2019t hit anything from the floor. Breanna Stewart wasn\u2019t much better. But Ionescu hit one big shot, and Stewart hit free throws under immense pressure. The MVP of the game, though, was Jonquel Jones. She picked up 17 points and six rebounds. \u201cThat is some of the most beautiful basketball we\u2019ve seen in WNBA history,\u201d says ESPN\u2019s Holly Rowe. Was it? Not really. This was a battle of attrition, not a shootout. Stewart gets the first postgame interview. \u201cI wanted to come here. I wanted to be the first (to win in New York).\u201d She won two championships in Seattle. Fiebich gets a steal after the inbounds play, and that\u2019s it. Lynx 62-67 Liberty, 10.1 seconds left, overtime: One down. Two down. Stewart has had a very rough night shooting, including some missed free throws, but she has come up huge at the line when it mattered most. Timeout Minnesota. Lynx 62-65 Liberty, 10.1 seconds left, overtime: New York inbound to Stewart. She\u2019s fouled. Can she ice the game at the line? Lynx 62-65 Liberty, 13 seconds left, overtime: The only field goals in overtime were scored eight seconds into the session and 1:46 in. Carleton tries a long 3 to tie \u2013 no! Sabally has the rebound. Collier fouls out. Spike Lee waves goodbye. Harsh. Lynx 62-65 Liberty, 18.4 seconds left, overtime: Ionescu misses a jumper, barely hitting the rim. 1-for-18. Williams turns it over to Stewart. New York kill the clock. Ionescu shoots from Caitlin Clark range with the shot clock running down. She\u2019s 1-for-19. Timeout Minnesota. Lynx 62-65 Liberty, 1:15 left, overtime: Offensive foul on Sabally. Rare call in pro basketball, but that was pretty blatant. Carleton was completely set to take the charge. Sabally gets quick redemption with a block on Collier. Hiedeman gets trapped on the sideline and turns it over. Timeout New York. One more solid offensive sequence might do it. Lynx 62-65 Liberty, 1:51 left, overtime: The long break to check the video, followed by a floor wipe, seems to have sapped the life out of the building. Will it affect the Liberty\u2019s momentum? Not yet, at least \u2013 more good defense, and Heideman tries to force a pass to Collier. Out of bounds. Stewart has a good look for a 3-pointer, but it comes up short. Again. McBride drives and draws a foul from Jones. She hits both shots. Lynx 60-65 Liberty, 2:44 left, overtime: No, not a \u201cclear path foul.\u201d Reminder \u2013 Collier has five fouls. One more, and she\u2019s out. Carleton also has five. Lynx 60-65 Liberty, 2:44 left, overtime: Good defense from New York, and McBride is forced to launch a 3. Airball, shot clock violation. McBride bounces back with a steal, and Sabally fouls. Could this be a \u201cclear path foul,\u201d which would give Minnesota two free throws and possession? I\u2019m inclined to say no, because Ionescu was in position to defend. Ionescu is 1-for-17. And New York are still winning. Who would\u2019ve guessed that? New York have been so close to putting this away already. Can they exorcise some demons and hang on here? Lynx 60-65 Liberty, 3:14 left, overtime: Fiebich opens with a 3! That\u2019s just the second for New York in this game. Sabally commits a foul but then snares the rebound on a Williams miss. Williams hasn\u2019t been herself tonight. Fiebich tries another 3 with the clock running down but misses. Williams misses a tough layup. New York turnover. Williams misses again and gets the rebound, but Sabally gets a steal and a breakaway layup. Timeout Minnesota. McBride puts up a long 3 and misses. New York win the scramble for the rebound, and the buzzer sounds. To overtime we go. Stewart makes the second. Tied. Stewart makes the first \u2026 Replay shows Smith got Stewart on the wrist. Can Stewart hit two clutch free throws after missing two? Or it\u2019ll be a foul. Smith fouls Stewart, who\u2019ll shoot two. Or maybe not \u2013 Minnesota are challenging the call. Lynx 60-58 Liberty, 5.2 seconds left, 4th quarter: Ionescu misses a 3. Carleton gets the rebound. Collier misses a layup. Stewart gets her 15th rebound. Timeout New York. The next update will announce the 2024 WNBA champion. Or overtime. Lynx 60-58 Liberty, 33 seconds left, 4th quarter: Oh, big call here. Carleton is called for blocking on Jones. That easily could\u2019ve gone the other way. Collier gets her fifth foul. Stewart misses both free throws! New York retain possession. Lynx 60-58 Liberty, 1:04 left, 4th quarter: Jones misses, and the Lynx gain possession. Collier drives the baseline, and Minnesota lead again. Stat check \u2026 Collier has 20, shooting 10-for-20. She\u2019s also the leading Lynx rebounder with seven. Jones leads the Liberty with 17 points. The next two scorers are both German national teamers \u2013 Sabally with 11, Fiebich with 10. Stewart has 14 rebounds. Lynx 58-58 Liberty, 1:35 left, 4th quarter: New York commits its fifth team foul somehow, so McBride goes to the line. She makes both. Stewart misses. Collier rebounds. Williams sizes up the defense and gives it to Collier, who drives and ties it. Timeout New York. Lynx 54-58 Liberty, 2:08 left, 4th quarter: McBride. Again. So many driving layups. AND FINALLY \u2026 Ionescu hits a 3! First field goal of the game for her, first 3 of the game for New York. Collier gets inside to answer at the other end. Ionescu figures she\u2019ll have another go. Misses, but ends up with the rebound and feeds it to Stewart, who\u2019s making a textbook backdoor cut and finishes. Beautiful. Lynx 50-53 Liberty, 3:41 left, 4th quarter: Another missed 3 for New York. Jones keeps it alive for Fiebich to get the rebound, and the German Olympian drives and draws a foul. Makes both. New York by 3. Lynx 50-51 Liberty, 3:57 left, 4th quarter: Another jump ball! Are we in the 1950s? Collier ties up Jones inside. For once, McBride doesn\u2019t get possession. Fiebich gets it. But Ionescu tries an impossible runner and is 0-for-13. Stewart gets a big block on Heideman, and Fiebich breaks a couple of ankles en route to a layup. Liberty back in front. Heideman 3-pointer misses. Ionescu gets the rebound and is knocked to the floor by Collier \u2013 that\u2019s her fourth. Uh oh. Can the Liberty really win this game without a 3-pointer? Or without a field goal from Ionescu? They\u2019re shooting 30.4% from the field, including 0-for-14 from 3-point range. Their free throws \u2013 15-for-17 \u2013 have kept them in it. They\u2019ve also built up a rebounding advantage \u2013 34-27, with Stewart hauling in 14. Lynx 50-49 Liberty, 5:29 left, 4th quarter: Replay shows I might have been harsh in saying Smith tried a judo toss. I think either player could\u2019ve been called for the foul, though. Beautiful pass from Stewart inside to Jones, who might be the MVP at this rate. She scores again. Carleton and Fiebich miss at each end. McBride finds a seam and scores. Maybe she\u2019ll be MVP? Nah \u2013 if Minnesota win, it\u2019s Collier. Hiedeman ties up the ball with Sabally. Shot clock down to four, and even after New York take possession, they only have time for Ionescu to heave up a prayer. Heideman takes the feed from McBride at the other end, and just like that, Minnesota reclaim the lead. Timeout New York. Anonymous email: \u201cWhat\u2019s with the foul disparity--do the Lynx have it coming to them with aggressive coverage(s)?\u201d I think it also has to do with the Liberty working the ball inside \u2013 a good choice when they can\u2019t hit a 3-pointer. Or maybe the back-and-forth accusations of favoritism from each coach in this series have warped the officials\u2019 minds. Lynx 46-47 Liberty, 7:26 left, 4th quarter: Ionescu heads to the bench. Jones gets tangled with Smith. Smith tries a judo toss but gets hurt in the process, while Jones is whistled for the foul. Life no longer makes sense. Timeout Minnesota. Whichever team regains composure first will probably win. Lynx 46-47 Liberty, 7:39 left, 4th quarter: Thornton starts the quarter by swiping the ball from Williams. But Ionescu misses \u2013 she\u2019s 0-for-11 from the field. Collier tries and tries and tries to get past Thornton and finally lowers her shoulder with two seconds on the shot clock. In professional basketball, for unknown reasons, that\u2019s always called against the defense. In the midst of a few misses in a frenzied sequence, McBride hits a layup. The crowd gets into a frenzy as Kayla Thornton ties up the ball with Alanna Smith and forces a jump ball. But McBride gains possession and draws a foul from Ionescu, then hits both free throws. Again it\u2019s Sabally, who has surely played the best quarter of her life. She drives and hits a running shot. She has scored 11 points in 8 minutes. Another defensive stop, but the Liberty can\u2019t get a good shot off before the buzzer. Ionescu flings it for New York\u2019s 12th miss from 3-point range. Huge quarter for the home team, outscoring Minnesota 20-10. They\u2019re 10 minutes away from their first championship. (Or 10 minutes away from Minnesota\u2019s fifth.) Lynx 42-45 Liberty, 50.9 seconds left, 3rd quarter: Courtney Williams resumes being Courtney Williams with a nifty drive. Jones turns it over. Williams misses a tough pullup jumper. Sabally, who has had a huge impact off the bench for New York, drives at Smith and draws a foul. She played with Ionescu at Oregon, and she played with Fiebich on the German Olympic team. More importantly, she hits both free throws. New York nearly forces Minnesota to rush a shot as the clock runs down, but Collier gets free after setting a pick and takes a short feed from Williams to score. Sabally again draws a foul and hits one of two. Williams misses, and New York feeds it inside to Jones against Collier. The Lynx star commits her third foul. Jones hits both shots. Lynx 38-40 Liberty, 3:07 left, 3rd quarter: Jones fouls McBride as bodies get tangled at the top of the arc. Fiebich gets a steal, Ionescu gets the ball and lobs it up to Sabally, and the game is tied! McBride misses, Ionescu threads an impossible pass to Sabally, and the Liberty lead! Timeout Minnesota. Lynx 38-36 Liberty, 4:02 left, 3rd quarter: Smith misses a long 3. Ionescu again forces things, but this time, she at least draws a foul from McBride. She\u2019s 0-for-9 from the field. Can she finally get her first points here? Yes \u2013 she hits both. Carleton, the Canadian player in the Lynx lineup, hits a 3-pointer from Vancouver. Collier blocks Fiebich\u2019s shot with the shot clock running down. Stewart returns the favor and gets a block on Collier. This is a good time to mention that New York have missed all 11 of their 3-point attempts. McBride\u2019s shot is blocked by Ionescu. Jones battles inside \u2013 the hoop and a foul. She has 12. With the free throw, make it 13. Lynx 35-31 Liberty, 5:53 left, 3rd quarter: Jones misses a 3 \u2013 that\u2019s probably not the shot New York wants. Collier tries an acrobatic shot in the lane but misses, and Stewart gets her 12th rebound. Jones finds Ionescu for the drive, and \u2026 was she fouled? Certainly seems so, but no whistle. Lynx 35-31 Liberty, 6:49 left, 3rd quarter: Laney-Hamilton swipes a pass, but the New York offense still looks out of sorts, and the possession ends with a Stewart miss. Williams misses, and Stewart gets her 11th rebound. Laney-Hamilton drives and expects a call, but she\u2019s not fouled. Smith does draw a foul at the other end for Minnesota\u2019s first free throws of the game. Misses the first, makes the second. Lynx 34-31 Liberty, 8:31 left, 3rd quarter: And Stewart takes a step toward proving me wrong with a nice fadeaway jumper. Then after a Liberty defensive stop, Stewart barely draws iron on a 3-pointer. Foul on Collier for putting a little bit of oomph when setting a pick on Ionescu. Laney-Hamilton hits a sweet pullup jumper, and \u2026 the Liberty are within three? Timeout Minnesota. ESPN has Breanna Stewart mic\u2019d up, and she told her team the shots will start falling. Not if they take the same shots they took in the first half. Stats of note \u2026 For Minnesota, Napheesa Collier is putting on an MVP-caliber performance. She has 14 points on 7-for-13 shooting. Kayla McBride has nine. For New York, you can\u2019t fault Breanna Stewart\u2019s effort. She has 10 rebounds. But she\u2019s 2-for-9 from the field. Sabrina Ionescu is simply having a nightmare \u2013 0-for-8. Despite Stewart\u2019s efforts, the Liberty haven\u2019t had a massive edge on the boards \u2013 they have 19 to Minnesota\u2019s 17. Minnesota\u2019s ball movement has been superb. They have 11 assists on 16 field goals. They have not yet attempted a free throw. That has to sting. The Liberty forced the Lynx to run down the shot clock, but then McBride just raced past Ionescu to score. At the other end, Minnesota knock the ball out of play with 2 seconds on the shot clock, and Thornton misses a 3. Collier misses a 3. Jones feeds it to Stewart inside, and she converts. Smith loses the handle. New York in transition \u2013 Ionescu passes out to Stewart, and \u2026 she misses. But Jones gets the rebound and draws a foul from Williams, much to Williams\u2019 dismay. Jones hits both free throws. She has nine points. Carleton travels. Can the Liberty close to within five at the break? Nope \u2013 Ionescu again misses a drive, and Stewart misses a tough shot at the buzzer. Lynx 32-23 Liberty, 1:59 left, 2nd quarter: Jones goes after Smith inside and draws a foul. She hits both free throws. ESPN says the Liberty have made 28 straight at the line. That\u2019s why Game 4 was close. Ionescu tries to drill a pass into Jones, and she\u2019s a little lucky that Collier fouled inside. Fiebich misses a 3. Stewart gets the rebound but misses a shot. Stewart battles for another rebound and draws a foul from Williams. And the Liberty\u2019s free-throw streak ends with Stewart\u2019s first attempt. She makes the second. Lynx 32-20 Liberty, 2:49 left, 2nd quarter: The crowd wants a traveling call. It will not happen. Collier scores. Minnesota calls timeout, perhaps in order to make a bunch of substitutions \u2013 among them, Courtney Williams will return after a long break. The sparkplug guard was winded through much of the fourth quarter in Game 4. She plays at 110 mph and knows nothing else. (Someone can surely convert that to km/h.) Lynx 30-20 Liberty, 3:12 left, 2nd quarter: Jones gets trapped inside in a triple-team. Collier gets called for traveling. See, that IS sometimes called in the pro game! Laney-Hamilton gets a nice roll on a turnaround jumper in the lane. Heideman sprints down the court to score for the Lynx. Fiebich tries to force a pass and turns it over. Collier misses a 3. Stewart drives awkwardly and turns it over. Collier fakes and hits a bank shot. Ten-point lead. She has 12. She\u2019s the only US national team who\u2019s looking like an Olympic champion here. Lynx 26-18 Liberty, 5:38 left, 2nd quarter: Ionescu misses a tough layup. She\u2019s 0-for-6. Shocker from the player who was basically the predecessor of Caitlin Clark in college. Liberty get a steal and a fast break, and Heideman blocks Fiebich\u2019s layup attempt. Timeout New York. Lynx 26-18 Liberty, 6:52 left, 2nd quarter: Leonie Fiebich draws a foul and hits her two shots. She and Jones have 12 of the Liberty\u2019s 18 points. Smith puts up an airball from 3-point range. Lynx 26-16 Liberty, 7:23 left, 2nd quarter: Jones gets a layup for the Liberty. She has 6 points. McBride hits a long 2. Breanna Stewart scores! A difficult jumper in the lane. Will that get her on track? (Note to sports commentators: It\u2019s \u201con track.\u201d Not \u201cuntracked,\u201d which is a bad thing.) Defensive stop for New York, and Fiebich scores on a nice drive. The German national teamer has been a solid contributor in this series. Collier scores. Stewart does not. McBride hits an impossible runner. Vanderslute comes in off the bench and tries to get something going inside, but her shot goes off the rim. Collier misses at the other end \u2013 a rare mistake from her in this game. Lynx 19-10 Liberty, 43.8 seconds left, 1st quarter: Ionescu misses horribly. Alanna Smith, who fought through back pain in Game 4, hits a nice 3. Fiebich misses, but Williams misses once again. The bench contributes for Minnesota \u2013 Natasha Heideman with a nice drive. Laney-Hamilton misses for New York \u2013 she rushed that one. McBride hands off to the onrushing Collier for a layup, and New York will take timeout. Lynx 12-10 Liberty, 2:24 left, 1st quarter: McBride hits a smooth jumper for a long 2. Stewart can\u2019t get the roll on a hook shot, but Thornton gets the putback. Lynx miss, and Sabally (who has just come in) gets inside to score for New York. It\u2019s another atrocious start for the Liberty, especially for their two megastars. Breanna Stewart looks tense and has put up two shots that have come up short. Sabrina Ionescu has been nowhere near on any of her three shots. At the other end, Courtney Williams is now 1-for-5. Still a sweet pass to Collier to open the scoring. Collier leads all scorers with six points. Lynx 10-6 Liberty, 3:57 left, 1st quarter: Again, it\u2019s Jonquel Jones picking up where Stewart and Ionescu are falling short. A strong drive brings the Liberty within four. Williams misses a corner 3. Her shot selection has been iffy so far. Ionescu has an open 3. It\u2019s an airball. Official timeout at last. Lynx 10-4 Liberty, 4:46 left, 1st quarter: After a brutal series of misses at each end, Williams gets a rebound and hits a very short-range jumper. Jones gets the Liberty on the board with a nice post move. Collier gets her third basket. Fiebich gets inside for the Liberty. Then Smith bumps into her defender at the top of the arc and winds up with an open lane for a layup. Jones gets a piece of Williams\u2019 shot. Lynx 4-0 Liberty, 7:06 left, 1st quarter: Williams opens things up with a beautiful bounce pass down the lane for Collier. What a series the Lynx point guard is having. The Liberty respond with a horrid sequence of pointless passes that result in a leaning off-balance 3-point attempt from Ionescu. Turnover Williams, but then the Liberty fail to take advantage as Stewart\u2019s shot barely draws iron. Collier gets her second bucket, this time on a feed from McBride. The next 90 seconds are not memorable. Lynx 0-0 Liberty, 10:00 left, 1st quarter: We\u2019re off at last. Tipoff has not actually happened yet. We were deceived. The Liberty have never won the WNBA championship. How about other NY teams? A quick look at each league and the last NY title \u2026 NWSL: 2023 (Gotham FC) Ultimate Frisbee Association (formerly AUDL): 2023 (New York Empire \u2013 that team was unbeatable) MLS: 2021 (NYCFC; the Red Bulls, original league members in 1996, have never won it) World Team Tennis: 2020 (New York Empire \u2013 not the Ultimate team) Women\u2019s hockey: 2018 (Metropolitan Riveters of the now-defunct PWF; the PWHL is new) NFL: 2011 (Giants) MLB: 2009 (Yankees) NHL: 2003 (New Jersey Devils \u2013 if you don\u2019t count the Devils, then go back to the Rangers in 1994) NBA: 1973 (Knicks) Coming up on ESPN \u2026 Spike Lee. The WNBA has arrived. Tipoff in 31 minutes and 45 seconds \u2013 around 8:06 p.m. Eastern time. Or whichever cliche you prefer for a winner-take-all final game in a best-of-5 series. Questions: 1. Will Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu bounce back from rough shooting nights in Game 4? 2. Can the Liberty\u2019s bench step up? 3. Will we see another weak start for the Liberty, or will that change now that they\u2019re playing at home? 4. For the Lynx, can Courtney Williams continue her stellar postseason? 5. Which coach will be complaining about the officiating after this game? The answers to those questions will determine the answer to the overriding question: Will we see the fifth championship for Minnesota or the first championship for New York? Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how Game 4 went down: Bridget Carleton made two free throws with two seconds left, and the Minnesota Lynx forced a decisive Game 5 of the WNBA finals, beating the New York Liberty 82-80 on Friday night. The teams will meet Sunday night in New York in the first Game 5 of the finals since 2019, when Washington topped Connecticut. \u201cLast 40 minutes of the season could be anywhere, we\u2019re going to be out there going to war and I\u2019m pumped,\u201d said Kayla McBride, who led the Lynx with 19 points. Courtney Williams added 15 points for Minnesota, which forced Liberty stars Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu into poor shooting nights. Ionescu\u2019s heave at the buzzer didn\u2019t hit the rim.",

Colleen Walker-Craig was one of three Indigenous children killed over a five-month period in 1990. The remains of two of the children \u2013 Evelyn Greenup, four, who was Colleen\u2019s cousin, and Clinton Speedy-Duroux, 16 \u2013 were discovered within months. Colleen\u2019s body was never located. Her clothes were found weighted down in the nearby Nambucca River. A coroner has found that she was probably murdered. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The three alleged murders were originally investigated separately before being linked by the homicide squad. \u201cOur presence in Bowraville this week is a testament to our ongoing commitment to this investigation and we hope this re-appeal can help us uncover new insights and ultimately move closer to justice,\u201d the homicide squad commander, Det Supt Danny Doherty, said on Monday. \u201cOne of the most heartbreaking aspects of this case is that Colleen\u2019s remains have never been found and that will be a key focus of our detectives this week. \u201cFinding Colleen\u2019s remains is absolutely critical in helping us close this painful chapter and we are hopeful there are still people out there who have information that could point us in the right direction.\u201d A man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was acquitted of Clinton\u2019s murder in 1994 and of Evelyn\u2019s murder in 2006. In 2018 the NSW government unsuccessfully argued in the state\u2019s court of criminal appeal that those two acquittals should be overturned and there should be a new single trial on three murder charges. They had argued this would be justified by fresh and compelling evidence relating to Colleen\u2019s disappearance. The high court refused to grant special leave to the government to appeal against the decision. In 2019, after the decision, the Greens MP David Shoebridge lobbied to change the state\u2019s double-jeopardy laws in the quest to get a retrial. This was unsuccessful after an inquiry found it could affect unrelated parts of the criminal justice system. Doherty said detectives would spend this week in Bowraville focused on finding Colleen\u2019s remains. There is a $1m reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for each alleged murder. \u201cDetectives will be spending the week in Bowraville to spread community consciousness and encourage anyone with information to come forward,\u201d Doherty said on Monday. \u201cNow is the time.\u201d",

And here\u2019s a summary of the latest key developments: Israel launched a wave of attacks on buildings belonging to al-Qard al-Hassan, a Hezbollah-run banking system that provides loans and banking services primarily to people who live in areas where Hezbollah is popular. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reported 11 strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Other strikes hit the association in Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa Valley and in the country\u2019s south, NNA added. One strike hit close to Beirut\u2019s airport. Israel may be causing the \u201cdestruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza\u2019s northernmost governate through death and displacement\u201d with its latest military campaign there, the UN\u2019s human rights office (OHCHR) said. The Israeli military (IDF) has made life in north Gaza \u201cimpossible\u201d for Palestinians, many of whom were already facing starvation, while also ordering their displacement and preventing supplies from entering, it said. Several Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured late on Sunday when Israeli airstrikes hit two schools housing displaced people in Jabalia, the area in northern Gaza that Israel has placed under siege for more than two weeks. Other deadly Israeli attacks took place in Beit Lahia and Gaza City\u2019s al-Tuffah neighbourhood, both in northern Gaza, and in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Israeli forces have \u201cdeliberately demolished an observation tower and perimeter fence of a UN position in Marwahin,\u201d Unifil said on Sunday. The UN peacekeeping mission added: \u201cYet again, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times.\u201d The US government is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel\u2019s plans to attack Iran. The US House speaker, Mike Johnson, confirmed the investigation in remarks to CNN\u2019s State of the Union program on Sunday, saying \u201cthe leak is very concerning.\u201d Medecins Sans Frontieres has condemned Israel\u2019s siege on the last remaining hospitals in Gaza, saying: \u201cThis is purely and simply a collective punishment imposed on Palestinians in Gaza, who must choose between being forcibly displaced from the North or killed. We fear that this will not stop.\u201d Hezbollah said on Sunday that it launched rockets at Haifa in Israel following the latest Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, Agence France-Presse reports. According to the group, its fighters launched a \u201crocket salvo\u201d at the \u201ccity of Haifa,\u201d adding that it was \u201cin response to the aggressions on [Beirut\u2019s] southern suburbs\u201d from Sunday morning. Top Israeli officials have discussed \u201cnew ideas\u201d regarding a deal to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, the Times of Israel is reporting, citing prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s spokesperson. The spokesperson\u2019s statement came at the end of an eight-hour meeting that began at 7.30pm according to the paper, which added that it was held in the defence ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. The paper said it had been told by an official ahead of the meeting that it would focus on how to \u201cwrap up\u201d the war in Gaza after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week. The official described Sinwar\u2019s body as \u201canother bargaining chip\u201d in negotiations, according to the Times. However that description of the meeting was not confirmed by Netanyahu\u2019s office, with an official earlier saying:\u201cWe are continuing to pressure Hamas militarily \u2026 You can see the effects in Jabaliya. We are continuing to kill Hamas members. We are pushing for a psychological collapse.\u201d It was earlier reported that the meeting was to focus on a potential Israeli strike on Iran. Sami Zoughaib, a researcher at the Lebanon-based thinktank the Policy Initiative, posits that the intense wave of strikes launched by Israel in the past hours are aimed at putting pressure on Lebanon ahead of a visit by US envoy Amos Hochstein, who is expected in the country on Monday. Arabic media reported that Lebanon\u2019s House Speaker, Nabih Berri, had told a television interviewer on Sunday that Hochstein\u2019s visit may be the US\u2019 last chance to reach a Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire agreement before the US election on 5 November. The UN\u2019s special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis, has reported \u201cwidespread panic\u201d after Israel\u2019s latest evacuation orders in the country which provided only a \u201cbrief window\u201d escape. She reminded the parties to the war that \u201csolutions remain available\u201d, adding: \u201cIf only opportunities would be seized.\u201d Israel may be causing the \u201cdestruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza\u2019s northernmost governate through death and displacement\u201d with its latest military campaign there, the UN\u2019s human rights office (OHCHR) has said in a statement. The Israeli military (IDF) has made life in north Gaza \u201cimpossible\u201d for Palestinians, many of whom were already facing starvation, while also ordering their displacement and preventing supplies from entering, it said. Israel has \u201ccontinued to relentlessly bomb and attack the area\u201d making it \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d for civilians to flee, the body wrote, adding that it had received reports of civilians being deliberately targeted. It added: Many Palestinians in the north have also expressed fears that should they flee; they will never be allowed to return to their homes in north Gaza. Israel has attacked two of the three main hospitals in the area \u2013 which were already damaged in previous attacks \u2013 and also bombed schools serving as shelters for displaced people, with many casualties appearing to be women and children. Medical and rescue teams were also reporting that Israel was hindering their movements as well as directly attacking them, OHCHR said. Palestinian men were meanwhile being detained by the IDF, \u201craising fears that they may be subjected to arbitrary detention as well as torture\u201d given the previous violations documented by the UN, it continued. The statement ended by reminding Israel of the provisional measures ordered by the international court of justice in January, which said Israel must ensure it did not commit acts of genocide in Gaza and reminded it that as an occupying power, it has a duty to ensure the provision of food, medicine and shelter to the population. The al-Qard al-Hassan Association, which Israel says is Hezbollah\u2019s financing arm, has said in a statement it has taken \u201call of the necessary procedures since the beginning of the war to safeguard your deposits and valuables and can confirm that you should not worry they are safe\u201d, Al Jazeera reports. The statement ended with \u201can eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth\u201d, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster. Hezbollah says it downed an Israeli Hermes 450 drone Sunday, without saying where. The Iran-backed group also says it has fired several rocket salvos at Israeli troops across the border. Several Palestinians have reportedly been killed and others injured late on Sunday when Israeli airstrikes hit two schools housing displaced people in Jabalia, the area in northern Gaza that Israel has placed under siege for more than two weeks. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the airstrikes targets the Unrwa-run Hafsa school and the Abu Hussein school in Jabalia refugee camp. Civil defence teams were banned from accessing the area to rescue those injured or trapped under the rubble. A fire also broke out at Hamad school due to an Israeli attack, Wafa reported. The school, which was sheltering displaced people, is adjacent to the Indonesian hospital and the fire reportedly spread to the hospital\u2019s generators. Several more Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes on the al-Fakhura area and Al-Hattab Street in Beit Lahia, both in northern Gaza, according to Wafa. There were further casualties when Israeli forces attacked a group of civilians in Gaza City\u2019s al-Tuffah neighbourhood and three civilians were killed when an Israeli drone hit a vehicle in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza. It was not possible to independently verify the reports as Israel does not allow foreign media into Gaza. The attacks come a day after an Israeli attack on the town of Beit Lahiya, north of Jabalia, flattened entire residential blocks and killed at least 87 people. The commander of an Israeli armoured brigade has been killed in northern Gaza, the Israeli military (IDF) has said. Col. Ehsan Daxa, the commander of the 401st Armored Brigade, is the highest ranking Israeli officer to have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on the Palestinian territory last year, according to Israeli media. He was killed when an explosive device exploded as he got out of a tank, the IDF said. Three other soldiers were injured. Lebanon\u2019s official National News Agency (NNA) has so far reported 11 strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, many of them targeting Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which Israel says is financing Hezbollah\u2019s operations against Israel. AFP reports further: It said a strike landed near Beirut\u2019s airport, the main entry-point of humanitarian assistance to the country and a major evacuation hub for those fleeing the conflict. Commercial planes were still seen flying past clouds of smoke over the embattled southern suburbs, said an AFP correspondent, who watched them land at Beirut\u2019s airport, located near targeted areas. AFP footage showed a column of smoke rising near one of the airports runways, as well as over nearby areas in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, hit hard by the nearly month-long war. In the suburb of Chiyah, the strikes flattened an entire building, AFP footage showed. Excavator\u2019s worked to clear the rubble, as rescuers scoured for survivors. The building housed a branch of Al-Qard Al-Hassan, according to an AFP correspondent. NNA also reported strikes targeting the association in Hermel, Riyaq and Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley region in Lebanon\u2019s east. The strike on Baalbek hit a commercial market housing a building formerly used by Al-Qard Al-Hassan, NNA said. An AFP correspondent said residents quickly evacuated the area after the Israeli army issued a warning. In south Lebanon, Israeli strikes hit branches near the cities of Sidon and Nabatieh, according to NNA. Journalist Leila Molana-Allen has posted footage of what she says are airstrikes right next to Beirut\u2019s airport: Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: Israel\u2019s military announced on Sunday night that it will begin striking buildings belonging to al-Qard al-Hassan, a Hezbollah-run banking system that provides loans and banking services primarily to people who live in areas where Hezbollah is popular. Israel said that the institution finances Hezbollah and that \u201cHezbollah uses this money to finance its terrorist activities,\u201d including purchasing and storing arms. Israeli strikes landed near Lebanon\u2019s only airport, Agence France-Presse reports. AFP cited a security source saying that two strikes landed close to the airport in Beirut as Israel attacked the capital\u2019s southern suburbs after issuing multiple evacuation orders. Israeli forces have \u201cdeliberately demolished an observation tower and perimeter fence of a UN position in Marwahin,\u201d Unifil said on Sunday. The UN peacekeeping mission added: \u201cYet again, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times.\u201d The US government is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel\u2019s plans to attack Iran. The US House speaker, Mike Johnson, confirmed the investigation in remarks to CNN\u2019s State of the Union program on Sunday, saying \u201cthe leak is very concerning.\u201d Medecins Sans Frontieres has condemned Israel\u2019s siege on the last remaining hospitals in Gaza, saying: \u201cThis is purely and simply a collective punishment imposed on Palestinians in Gaza, who must choose between being forcibly displaced from the North or killed. We fear that this will not stop.\u201d Hezbollah said on Sunday that it launched rockets at Haifa in Israel following the latest Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, Agence France-Presse reports. According to the group, its fighters launched a \u201crocket salvo\u201d at the \u201ccity of Haifa,\u201d adding that it was \u201cin response to the aggressions on [Beirut\u2019s] southern suburbs\u201d from Sunday morning. Here are more images coming through the newswires from Beirut following Israeli strikes across the city on Sunday evening: Israeli strikes landed near Lebanon\u2019s only airport, Agence France-Presse reports. AFP cited a security source saying that two strikes landed close to the airport in Beirut as Israel attacked the capital\u2019s southern suburbs after issuing multiple evacuation orders. Videos emerging on social media are showing buildings being leveled and fires starting across Beirut as Israel strikes Lebanon\u2019s capital: Here is more from Reuters on the scenes from Beirut as residents flee amid Israeli airstrikes on the capital: Hundreds of Beirut residents fled their homes late on Sunday after Israel said it was preparing attacks on sites linked to the financial operations of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group within hours and told people to leave those areas immediately. Soon after the Israeli warning, several blasts were heard and a large fire was seen in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. There was no immediate information on what caused the explosion, or details of any casualties. Panicked crowds clogged the streets and caused traffic jams in some parts of Beirut as they tried to get to neighbourhoods thought to be safer, witnesses said. Here are some images coming through the newswires from Beirut where explosions and smoke are being reported from the city: Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency is reporting an evacuation of buildings adjacent to the al-Qard al-Hassan branch in Beirut following reports of blasts in the city. The reported evacuations come after Israel said it will begin striking buildings belonging to al-Qard al-Hassan, a Hezbollah-run banking system that provides loans and banking services mostly to people who live in areas where Hezbollah is popular. A blast was heard across Beirut on Saturday evening, according to Reuters\u2019 witnesses who also saw plumes of smoke across the city. More details to follow. Israeli forces have \u201cdeliberately demolished an observation tower and perimeter fence of a UN position in Marwahin,\u201d Unifil said on Sunday. The UN peacekeeping mission added: \u201cYet again, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times.\u201d In recent weeks, the IDF has targeted Unifil watchtowers and peacekeepers multiple times across Lebanon. Israel has also repeatedly demanded that Unifil vacate its positions along the UN-mandated Blue Line \u2013 a demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights \u2013 which Unifil has refused to yield to. \u201cDespite the pressure being exerted on the mission and our troop-contributing countries, peacekeepers remain in all positions,\u201d the mission said. Israel\u2019s military announced on Sunday night that it will begin striking buildings belonging to al-Qard al-Hassan, a Hezbollah-run banking system that provides loans and banking services primarily to people who live in areas where Hezbollah is popular. Israel said that the institution finances Hezbollah and that \u201cHezbollah uses this money to finance its terrorist activities,\u201d including purchasing and storing arms. Founded in the 1980s, al-Qard al-Hassan provides interest free loans in line with Islamic banking principles. After Lebanon\u2019s 2019 banking crisis which saw commercial banks freeze accounts, al-Qard al-Hassan became more popular in Lebanon, as it gives collateral-based loans on personal assets such as loans. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese bank with al-Qard al-Hassan, primarily in areas where Hezbollah is popular, but last year the bank even opened a branch in a Christian town in Hezbollah. The bank has branches all over the country, with at least 15 branches in Beirut alone. The institution was sanctioned by the US in 2017 during the Trump administration due to the fact that it gave Hezbollah access to the international financial system, according to the US Treasury. Al-Qard al-Hassan is a branch of Hezbollah\u2019s robust social services network. Analysts have said that the group\u2019s social services are key to its popularity, with a network of hospitals, schools and ambulance corps serving areas where state investment has traditionally been low. Human rights organisations have said that affiliation with Hezbollah does not make civilian institutions legitimate military targets. Over the past year, Israel has killed dozens of medics and first responders who work in the Islamic Health Committee, a Hezbollah-affiliated health service A 41-year-old Israeli colonel was killed and another officer was wounded in combat in northern Gaza on Sunday, the Israeli military said. Israel\u2019s Channel 12 and public broadcaster Kan reported an explosive device had gone off under a tank. On a visit near the border of Lebanon, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said forces were dismantling Hezbollah tunnels, weapons stores and infrastructure. \u201cOur goal is to completely \u2018clean\u2019 the area so that Israel\u2019s northern communities may return to their homes,\u201d he added. Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with former U.S. president Donald Trump, the prime minister\u2019s office said on Sunday. \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu reiterated what he has also said publicly: Israel takes into account the issues the U.S. administration raises, but in the end, will make its decisions based on its national interests,\u201d it said. Trump, speaking later to reporters in Philadelphia, said he had had \u201ca very nice call\u201d with Netanyahu on Saturday. The Israeli leader had asked his opinion about what to do with Iran, he said. Israel is pondering its military reaction to recent Iranian missile strikes, Reuters reports. \u201cHe was asking what I thought. And I just said, you do what you have to do,\u201d Trump said. Here is the full story on Israel\u2019s foreign minister announcing he is taking \u201clegal and diplomatic measures\u201d against the decision by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to ban Israeli companies from showing their wares at an arms fair in Paris next month. Minister Israel Katz described the \u201cboycott\u201d as an anti-democratic measure that was \u201cnot acceptable, especially between friendly nations\u201d. Katz did not elaborate on the measures he had in mind and the French government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Organisers of the Euronaval Salon, a naval defence fair due to take place between 4-7 November, told Reuters that after a decision by the French government no Israeli stands or exhibits would be allowed, although delegates could attend. The US government is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel\u2019s plans to attack Iran. The Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports: The US House speaker, Mike Johnson, confirmed the investigation in remarks to CNN\u2019s State of the Union program on Sunday, saying \u201cthe leak is very concerning\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s some serious allegations being made there,\u201d the Republican from Louisiana said. \u201cThe investigation\u2019s underway, and I\u2019ll get a briefing on that in a couple of hours.\u201d Three US officials had earlier told the Associated Press about the investigation into the leak. A fourth US official said the documents in question appear to be legitimate. The documents are attributed to the US Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, and they note that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran\u2019s blistering ballistic missile attack on 1 October. They were sharable within the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d, which are the US, Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.

We fear that this will not stop.\u201d Adding to the statement, Anna Halford, MSF emergency coordinator in Gaza, said: \u201cThe ever-worsening escalation of violence and non-stop Israeli military operations that we have been witnessing over the past two weeks in northern Gaza have horrifying consequences.\u201d Tens of thousands of people remain trapped in Jabalia refugee camp amid daily Israeli attacks while more than 350 patients are reported to be trapped inside Indonesian, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals. Those include pregnant women and people who just underwent surgical operations. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), an intergovernmental body representing the world\u2019s Muslim-majority countries, has condemned Israel\u2019s airstrikes in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, which killed at least 70 civilians on Saturday night and injured many more. In a statement the OIC said it \u201cviews this atrocity as a continuation of the many massacres, acts of genocide, and ethnic cleansing perpetrated against the Palestinian people\u201d, and said it called on the UN security council to impose a ceasefire in Gaza. Hezbollah said on Sunday that it launched rockets at Haifa in Israel following the latest Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, Agence France-Presse reports. According to the group, its fighters launched a \u201crocket salvo\u201d at the \u201ccity of Haifa,\u201d adding that it was \u201cin response to the aggressions on [Beirut\u2019s] southern suburbs\u201d from Sunday morning. Another war of words (or tweets) has erupted between the Turkish and Israeli governments, following foreign minister Israel Katz tagging Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in a post on X with a picture of Yahya Sinwar\u2019s corpse, accompanied by a caption that read: \u201c@RTErdogan, take back your rapist and murderer friend Sinwar.\u201d Turkey\u2019s official foreign ministry account then shared a post in response with images of people carrying dead bodies and participating in funerals in Gaza, saying its government would \u201ccontinue to work to ensure that those responsible for this genocide receive the punishment they deserve.\u201d On Saturday, Turkey\u2019s public broadcaster reported that AKP spokesperson \u00d6mer \u00c7elik weighed in on the flare-up in defence of Erdo\u011fan accusing Katz of being a member of a \u201cmurder network\u201d. He added: \u201cOur President is a defender of human values.\u201d The Israeli foreign minister has lashed out at France following its decision to ban Israeli firms from exhibiting stands or showing equipment next month\u2019s naval arms show in Paris. In a statement on X, Israel Katz wrote: I asked the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs to take legal and diplomatic measures against the decision of French president Emmanuel Macron to prevent Israeli companies from presenting their products at the @SalonEuronaval show in Paris next month. The boycott of Israeli companies and this, for the second time, with the imposition of unacceptable conditions, are undemocratic measures that in our eyes are not acceptable, moreover between friendly nations. I urge president Macron to cancel them completely.\u201d This marks the second time Israeli firms have been banned from a defense show. In May, France prohibited Israeli companies from showcasing their products in the Eurosatory military trade show as Macron called for a ceasefire in Gaza. Since last October, Israel has killed at least 43,000 Palestinians \u2013 including healthcare workers and journalists \u2013 across Gaza while forcibly displacing 2 million survivors across the narrow strip amid severe shortages in food, water and medical supplies due to Israeli aid restrictions. Israel\u2019s expanded invasion into Lebanon has also killed at least 2,300 people while displacing an additional 1.2 million people across the country in recent weeks. Here are some recent pictures coming out of Gaza that have been sent to us over the newswires: Tehran is still bracing for Israeli retaliation for Iran\u2019s missile attack on the country on 1 October 2024. The strikes, which Iran said were aimed at military bases, were largely thwarted by Israel\u2019s aerial defences with support from its western allies. Iran said the attack was launched in retaliation for Israel\u2019s assassination of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders and Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and assault on Lebanon. The US is now investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel\u2019s plans for retaliation against Iran. Israel has not said how it will respond, but it could try to strike Iran\u2019s cluster of missile and drone bases, its economic infrastructure or its oil terminals/facilities. Washington has not denied that the leaked files, which appear to be the US\u2019s assessment of Israel\u2019s preparations, are authentic. As my colleague, Bethan McKernan, writes in this story, the papers supposedly date from 15 and 16 October, and allege that Israel has fortified underground warplane bunkers at the Hatzerim airbase, where there are signs of preparation for arming plane-launched ballistic missiles. An Israeli source told Haaretz that the US had apologised to Israel for the leak. US House speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday there was an investigation underway into the leak, telling CNN: \u201cThere\u2019s a classified-level briefing... we are following it closely.\u201d The leak is expected to be discussed in the Israeli security cabinet meeting, chaired by the country\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at 7:30 pm local time (5.30pm BST, 12.30pm ET) tonight. Emily Dugan is a senior reporter for the Guardian A return of Islamic extremist terror attacks on British soil could be triggered by the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, the former head of MI6 has said. Sir John Sawers said police and intelligence agencies in Britain should be \u201con their toes\u201d after changes of leadership at terrorist organisations in the Middle East. On Thursday Israeli troops confirmed the assassination of the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the Palestinian militant group\u2019s 7 October attacks last year. In an interview with Sky News\u2019s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, Sawers said: Islamic terrorism may actually get a further boost, if that\u2019s the right word, from events in the Middle East. The frustrations that we\u2019ll be seeing because of the lack of movement on the Palestinian question, because of the violence people are witnessing every day. And it could be that Hezbollah and Hamas, the new leaderships there, are focused so much on violence that they become not just terrorist organisations designated by western countries and aimed against Israel, but they could revert back to international terrorism, including here in the UK. You can read the full story here: Hezbollah said it launched rocket salvos at Israeli troops in two villages inside Lebanese territory, near the southern border, on Sunday. Fighters from the Lebanese militant group launched \u201ca rocket salvo\u201d at Israeli \u201cenemy forces\u201d on the outskirts of the village of Markaba, as well as on soldiers nearby, \u201cwest of the village of Adaisseh\u201d, the group said. Israel\u2019s military says around 160 projectiles have been launched from Lebanon as of 15:00 local time (many of which have been successfully intercepted). Three Lebanese soldiers were killed in an Israeli strike on an army vehicle in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese military said. The troops were killed on a road connecting the border village of Ain Ebel to the nearby town of Hanin, the army said. Israel struck dozens of south Lebanon villages and towns overnight, according to reports. There were also airstrikes reported in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, with residents in Haret Hreik and Hadath ordered to evacuate on Sunday morning. The Israeli military said it hit the \u201ccommand centre of Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence headquarters\u201d and underground weapons facility in Beirut and that it killed three Hezbollah militants in other strikes. It later said about 70 projectiles fired from Lebanon crossed into Israel within a matter of minutes, and that it intercepted some of them. There were reports that the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, has seen intense Israeli bombing and gunfire for several hours, risking patient and staff safety. Hussam Abu Safia, the hospital\u2019s director, said medical services were severely disrupted after Israeli airstrikes damaged the hospital\u2019s water tanks and electricity grid. At least 87 people were killed in Israeli strikes in the city of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza yesterday, according to figures provided by the territory\u2019s health ministry earlier today. At least 42,603 Palestinian people have been killed and 99,795 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the health ministry said in a statement. The UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Tor Wennesland, said in a statement that \u201cthe nightmare in Gaza is intensifying\u201d as \u201crelentless Israeli strikes\u201d are being launched in Gaza where \u201chorrifying scenes are unfolding in the northern strip\u201d. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said not enough aid is being allowed into Gaza. \u201cWe can\u2019t run a humanitarian operation at the scale needed with just a few unreliable and poorly accessible crossing points.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, is set to convene his security cabinet at 7:30 pm local time (5.30pm BST, 12.30pm ET) in Tel Aviv. The Lebanese army says three soldiers have been killed in an Israeli strike on a military vehicle in southern Lebanon, according to a snap from the Reuters news agency. We\u2019ll have more detail shortly The London School of Economics has been criticised by a UN rapporteur and accused of Islamophobia after raising an allegation that students behind a pro-Palestine demonstration in July had prompted fears of a repeat of the 7/7 terrorist attacks. Chief reporter Daniel Boffey writes: A total of seven students, four of them female, have been put under \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d, restricting their access to the university\u2019s campus, over allegations relating to a noisy protest on 7 July in the atrium of the LSE student services centre. In letters informing the group of the action and the potential for further disciplinary measures, the university said that \u201cseveral witnesses, including security guards, and members of staff, expressed concerns, fear and distress\u201d over their conduct. One staff member quoted by the university claimed that the demonstration had led \u201cmany in the room\u201d to fear a \u201cphysical attack\u201d. This feeling was said to have been \u201cheightened\u201d by its coincidental timing on the 19th anniversary of the 2005 bombings. The students, who had been calling for the LSE to divest from companies that work with the Israeli military, deny the claims, which they say have been used to stifle free expression. Benjamin Netanyahu is set to convene his security cabinet at 7:30 pm local time (5.30pm BST, 12.30pm ET) in Tel Aviv, according to reports in Israel. The Times of Israel says the meeting comes as Israel prepares to strike Iran in response to the 1 October ballistic missile attack. The UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Tor Wennesland, has issued the following statement, in which he says \u201crelentless Israeli strikes\u201d are being launched in Gaza where nowhere is safe for civilians to escape bombardments. He said: The nightmare in Gaza is intensifying. Horrifying scenes are unfolding in the northern Strip amidst conflict, relentless Israeli strikes and an ever-worsening humanitarian crisis. In Beit Lahia last night, dozens were reportedly killed in Israeli airstrikes. This follows weeks of intensified operations resulting in scores of civilian fatalities and near total lack of humanitarian aid reaching populations in the north. Nowhere is safe in Gaza. I condemn the continuing attacks on civilians. This war must end, the hostages held by Hamas must be freed, the displacement of Palestinians must cease, and civilians must be protected wherever they are. Humanitarian aid must be delivered unimpeded. The path ahead will require courage, political will and renewed dialogue. We owe it to the families suffering in Gaza and Israel. The war must stop now. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 30 rockets have been launched from Lebanon at northern Israel. Some were intercepted by the airforce, while others crashed into areas, sparking fires, the IDF said in a post on X. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory said not enough aid is being allowed into Gaza. It said: We can\u2019t run a humanitarian operation at the scale needed with just a few unreliable and poorly accessible crossing points. Aid has only been facilitated when it has reached the people who need it, when they need it. Last week, the US warned Israel that it faces possible punishment, including the potential stopping of American weapons transfers, if it does not take immediate action to let more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Humanitarian groups have made repeated calls for increased deliveries of food and medicine to the territory amid fears that Israel may be trying to force Palestinians to leave northern Gaza using starvation. Since Israel began a renewed assault on northern Gaza a fortnight ago, charities have said virtually no aid has entered the area (the UN said on Monday that Israel blocked all food aid entering northern Gaza from 2-15 October). Israel officials have denied accusations that aid is being deliberately blocked from reaching northern Gaza. Internet connectivity went down in northern Gaza last night and, as of midday today, has not been restored. In the past two days, Israeli forces have detained at least 30 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank, according to a joint statement from the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society and the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs. The detentions were reported to have taken place in the areas of Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah, Jenin, Jericho, Jerusalem and Salfit, among others. It is estimated that over 11,300 Palestinians have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since last October. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the West Bank. They have described alleged abusive and humiliating treatment, including holding blindfolded and handcuffed detainees in cramped cages as well as beatings, intimidation and harassment. At least 42,603 Palestinian people have been killed and 99,795 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Of those, 84 Palestinians were killed in the latest 24-hour reporting period, according to the ministry, which has said in the past that thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said 87 people were killed or missing under the rubble after the Israeli attack on Saturday on Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza. More than 40 others were injured, the ministry said. The Israeli military said they were checking the report. Officials in Gaza last night said 73 people had been killed in the airstrikes, which you can read more about here. Israel earlier claimed that these figures were \u201cexaggerated\u201d, without elaborating. Al Jazeera is reporting that the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, is being attacked by Israeli forces. Hussam Abu Safia, the hospital\u2019s director, said medical services were severely disrupted after Israeli airstrikes damaged the hospital\u2019s water tanks and electricity grid. The area surrounding the hospital, which offers paediatric intensive care facilities and a malnutrition clinic, has seen intense bombing and gunfire for several hours, risking patient and staff safety, he added. Dr Eid Sabbah, Kamal Adwan hospital\u2019s director of nursing, has spoken to the BBC. He said Israeli attacks on hospitals must stop \u201cbefore it\u2019s too late\u201d and \u201cour nation is exterminated\u201d. Dr Sabbah said Israeli airstrikes in Beit Lahiya targeted an entire residential square in between Abu Jidian roundabout and Al Qassam mosque. He said dozens of people were killed in the attacks, which reportedly also destroyed several residential buildings, and many other Palestinian people were injured, \u201csome of whom reached the hospital, some of whom remain under the rubble\u201d. Israeli officials accuse Hamas of building command centres under hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. Hamas denies the charge. The latest Israeli attack on the Kamal Adwan hospital comes amid an intensifying of air and artillery strikes that have hit northern Gaza \u2013 especially Jabalia \u2013 over the last two weeks. Doctors at the Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals have refused to leave their patients despite evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military. All three hospitals are facing dire shortages of fuel and other supplies, according to the UN, which said no humanitarian supplies entered northern Gaza from Israel\u2019s crossing for the first two weeks of this month. The entirety of northern Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders. The Israeli army, which says it is targeting regrouping Hamas fighters, has ordered residents to flee towards the so-called \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d of al-Mawasi, even though it has been targeted in deadly airstrikes and is severely overcrowded. The Israeli military said about 70 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israel within minutes on Sunday. The military said in a post on X: Following the alerts that were activated at 11:09 (0809 GMT) and 11:12 in the western and upper Galilee areas, about 70 launches were detected that crossed the territory of Lebanon. Some of them were intercepted by the air force, several crashes were detected in the area. Firefighters are working to put out several fires that have developed in the area. Hezbollah has warned that its fighting with Israel is now entering a new phase. The Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group has not detailed exactly what this will entail. Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency (NNA) has said \u201cIsraeli troops blew up the Tarrash neighbourhood in Mais al-Jabal\u2026 after booby-trapping it with highly explosive materials.\u201d The troops \u201cbulldozed the cemetery in the village of Blida\u201d nearby, the NNA added in its reporting, which has not yet been verified by the Guardian. Mais al-Jabal is a village in Lebanon less than two kilometers away from the border with Israel. It has been a frequent target of Israeli attacks. Most residents have been evacuated from the village to avoid the trading of fire between Hezbollah and Israel, which has happened almost daily since the start of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza last October. As we mentioned in the opening summary, the Israeli military has launched another round of airstrikes on the Lebanese capital, targeting Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in particular. Here are some of the latest images of the aftermath of the attacks sent to us over the newswires: Israel struck dozens of south Lebanon villages and towns overnight and targeted Nabatiyeh city for a third time this week, Lebanese state media reports. \u201cWarplanes struck... the city of Nabatiyeh seven times,\u201d Lebanon\u2019s official National News Agency said, adding that Israeli jets \u201cconducted strikes\u201d on over 50 towns and villages. It is not yet clear how many people were killed or injured in the Israeli attacks. The Israeli military said it has carried out a strike on a Hezbollah command centre and underground weapons facility in Beirut, Lebanon\u2019s capital. In a statement, the military said: Earlier this morning (Sunday), the IAF (Israeli air force) conducted an intelligence-based strike on a command centre of Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence headquarters and an underground weapons workshop in Beirut. The Israeli air force said fighter jets killed Alhaj Abbas Salama, who it described as a senior member of Hezbollah\u2019s southern front command, in the Tebinin area of Lebanon, and killed two other Hezbollah figures. Two Beirut neighbourhoods \u2013 Haret Hreik and Hadath \u2013 were warned by the Israeli military this morning to evacuate immediately, signalling the resumption of intense airstrikes on the city for a second day. Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, in particular, have been repeatedly bombed by the Israeli military over the past weeks, killing many civilians. At least 759 Palestinian people in the occupied West Bank have been killed by Israeli forces since last October, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, cited the territory\u2019s health ministry as saying. The ministry said among the victims were 165 children and 18 women. There were over 6,500 recorded injuries. Most of the Palestinians killed in the last year there were killed by Israeli troops and some by settlers, according to local health officials. Israeli forces have intensified their nearly daily search and arrest raids in the West Bank since its war on Gaza was launched following the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on southern Israel in 2023. The number of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank \u2013 which are considered illegal under international law \u2013 have hit new records. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu governs with the support of far-right parties that advocate more Israeli settlements in the West Bank and outright annexation. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of Israel\u2019s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. In northern Gaza, an Israeli airstrike hit several houses and a multi-storey residential building in the town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza on Saturday night, killing at least 73 people, officials said. The Hamas media office said at least 73 people had been killed. Medway Abbas, a senior health ministry official, said these figures were accurate. There were also reports of more potential casualties trapped under rubble in the densely populated area. Palestinian health officials said rescue operations were being hampered by the cut-off telecommunication and internet services that have been down for a second day. The US government is investigating an alleged leak about classified US intelligence on Israel\u2019s strikes against Iran, CNN reports. CNN reports that the documents which date from 15 and 16 October started circulating on Friday on Telegram through an account called the Middle East Spectator. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained \u2013 including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the US intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack \u2013 and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, the Associated Press reports. Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties. Neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time. \u201cThe attempt by Iran\u2019s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement, vowing that Iran and its proxies would \u201cpay a heavy price\u201d. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu after reports of an attempted drone attack on the Israeli prime minister\u2019s holiday home in Saturday. According to a Downing Street spokesperson, Starmer told Netanyahu that he was alarmed to hear about what Netanyahu called an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d on his life. G7 defence ministers expressed their concern over Israel\u2019s latest attacks on Unifil in Lebanon. The group, which has been meeting in Naples, Italy, said: \u201cWe are concerned by the latest events in Lebanon and the risk of further escalation. We express concern over all threats to Unifil\u2019s security.\u201d The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday, reviewing US forces\u2019 \u201cposture adjustments\u201d. Those include the recent deployment of an anti-missile system to reinforce Israel\u2019s defences against regional threats, the Pentagon said in a statement. The US would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, Austin said. \u201cThe number of civilian casualties have been far too high,\u201d Austin told reporters at a G7 defence gathering in Naples. Two Israeli airstrikes targeted south Beirut early on Sunday, Lebanese state media reports. \u201cEnemy (Israeli) airplanes carried out two strikes this morning on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, one of them hitting a residential building in Haret Hreik\u201d near a mosque and a hospital, the National news agency reported. There were no immediate details of casualties or property damage. The Israeli army ordered civilians located near buildings it claimed were \u201caffiliated with Hezbollah\u201d in two neighbourhoods in south Beirut to immediately evacuate early this morning.",

      "bodyText": "Australia could toughen the rules regarding the acceptable levels of key PFAS chemicals in drinking water, lowering the amount of so-called forever chemicals allowed per litre. The National Health and Medical Research Council on Monday released draft guidelines revising the limits for four PFAS chemicals in drinking water. PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), a class of several thousand compounds, are sometimes referred to as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d as they persist in the environment for long periods of time and are more difficult to destroy than substances such as sugars or proteins. PFAS exposure is wide and not limited to drinking water. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The draft guidelines set out recommendations for PFAS limits in drinking water over a person\u2019s lifetime. Under the draft, the limit for PFOA \u2013 a compound used to make Teflon \u2013 would be lowered from 560 ng/L to 200 ng/L, based on evidence of their cancer-causing effects. Based on new concerns about bone marrow effects, the limits for PFOS \u2013 previously the key ingredient in the fabric protector Scotchgard \u2013 would be cut from 70 ng/L to 4 ng/L. In December last year, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified PFOA as cancer-causing to humans \u2013 in the same category as drinking alcohol and outdoor air pollution \u2013 and PFOS as \u201cpossibly\u201d carcinogenic. The guidelines also propose new limits for two PFAS compounds based on evidence of thyroid effects, of 30ng/L for PFHxS and 1000 ng/L for PFBS. PFBS has been used as a replacement for PFOS in Scotchgard since 2023. The NHMRC chief executive, Prof Steve Wesselingh, said in a media briefing that the new limits were set based on evidence from animal studies. \u201cWe currently don\u2019t believe there are human studies of sufficient quality to guide us in developing these numbers,\u201d he said. The proposed PFOS limit would be in line with US guidelines, while the Australian limit of PFOA would still be higher. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for guideline values to vary from country to country around the world based on different methodologies and endpoints used,\u201d Wesseleigh said. The US aims for zero concentrations of carcinogenic compounds, while Australian regulators take a \u201cthreshold model\u201d approach. \u201cIf we get below that threshold level, we believe that there is no risk of that substance causing the problem identified, whether they be thyroid problems, bone marrow problems or cancer,\u201d Wesseleigh said. The NHMRC considered setting a combined PFAS drinking water limit but deemed it impractical given the numbers of PFAS chemicals. \u201cThere are very large numbers of PFAS, and we don\u2019t have toxicological information for the great majority of them,\u201d Dr David Cunliffe, principal water quality adviser for the SA health department, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken this path of producing individual guideline values for those PFAS where there is data available.\u201d PFAS management is shared between the federal government and the state and territories, which regulate water supply.
