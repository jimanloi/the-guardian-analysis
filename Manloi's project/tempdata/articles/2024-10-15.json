His work soon garnered attention across Europe, with publications in magazines such as Esquire, the Sunday Times, Metropolis and Twen. Frank\u2019s photographs chronicled the faces and moments of the era, from Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones to Vanessa Redgrave, Roman Polanski, Charles Aznavour, Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. His 1969 book Young London: Permissive Paradise is considered a collector\u2019s item today and is held in prestigious institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York.</p> <p>English author Valerie Mendes wrote about Frank in Metropolis magazine in 1969: \u201cLondon without her people would be dead indeed. Habicht finds not the clothes but the men and women who wear them; not the places, but those who live and work within the city. In the contrasting textures of skin and water, trees and hair, soft body curves against metal and stone, he traces an intricate pattern of London\u2019s heart and its restlessness.\u201d</p>    <p>My father would treat street children the same as he would treat the Rolling Stones, and vice versa, when taking photographs. And celebrities really responded to that, and often invited him to stay with them for the weekend.</p> <p>Decades later, his work was included in the Strange and Familiar exhibition curated by Martin Parr, shown at the Barbican Centre and Manchester Art Gallery in 2016.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/feb/04/time-caught-up-with-his-visions-friedensreich-hundertwassers-new-zealand-legacy\">\u2018Time caught up with his visions\u2019: Friedensreich Hundertwasser\u2019s New Zealand legacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1981, Frank settled in New Zealand\u2019s Bay of Islands, drawn by its beauty and tranquility. Here, he devoted much of his time to photographing the landscapes and communities of the region. His works, including Bay of Islands: Where the Sunday Grass is Greener and Bay of Islands: A Paradise Found, reflect his deep connection to his adopted homeland where his subjects included Dame Whina Cooper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/apr/14/guardianobituaries2\">Friedensreich Hundertwasser</a>, Queen Elizabeth II at Waitangi Day celebrations and protests, and the unique life in the Far North.</p>    <p>In his later years, Frank\u2019s final published work, As It Was, became a poignant, extensive reflection on his life in London in the 1960s.</p> <p>This year, I began interviewing my father for a book to inspire young photographers.</p> <p>\u201cMy camera became an extension of myself, a partner in my journey to capture the essence of my surroundings,\u201d Habicht told me, summing up his relationship with his craft.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need expensive gear to take memorable photographs.

His work soon garnered attention across Europe, with publications in magazines such as Esquire, the Sunday Times, Metropolis and Twen. Frank\u2019s photographs chronicled the faces and moments of the era, from Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones to Vanessa Redgrave, Roman Polanski, Charles Aznavour, Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. His 1969 book Young London: Permissive Paradise is considered a collector\u2019s item today and is held in prestigious institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. English author Valerie Mendes wrote about Frank in Metropolis magazine in 1969: \u201cLondon without her people would be dead indeed. Habicht finds not the clothes but the men and women who wear them; not the places, but those who live and work within the city. In the contrasting textures of skin and water, trees and hair, soft body curves against metal and stone, he traces an intricate pattern of London\u2019s heart and its restlessness.\u201d My father would treat street children the same as he would treat the Rolling Stones, and vice versa, when taking photographs. And celebrities really responded to that, and often invited him to stay with them for the weekend. Decades later, his work was included in the Strange and Familiar exhibition curated by Martin Parr, shown at the Barbican Centre and Manchester Art Gallery in 2016. In 1981, Frank settled in New Zealand\u2019s Bay of Islands, drawn by its beauty and tranquility. Here, he devoted much of his time to photographing the landscapes and communities of the region. His works, including Bay of Islands: Where the Sunday Grass is Greener and Bay of Islands: A Paradise Found, reflect his deep connection to his adopted homeland where his subjects included Dame Whina Cooper, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Queen Elizabeth II at Waitangi Day celebrations and protests, and the unique life in the Far North. In his later years, Frank\u2019s final published work, As It Was, became a poignant, extensive reflection on his life in London in the 1960s. This year, I began interviewing my father for a book to inspire young photographers. \u201cMy camera became an extension of myself, a partner in my journey to capture the essence of my surroundings,\u201d Habicht told me, summing up his relationship with his craft. \u201cYou don\u2019t need expensive gear to take memorable photographs. To be honest, I hardly knew how to use studio lights and always preferred shooting with natural light, especially on my London rooftop,\u201d he said. My father was deeply guided by the Sioux Native American quote, \u201cWith all beings and all things, we shall be as relatives,\u201d a philosophy that shaped his perspective in both life and art. He often spoke of his love for film photography, a medium he remained loyal to through out his career. \u201cI still prefer to shoot with film. It makes every captured moment precious,\u201d Frank said. Reflecting on his personal life, he shared: \u201cThe quirky girl in the photo [Till Death Do Us Part] happens to be my dear wife Christine. We met at a New Year\u2019s party in London on December 31, 1969, on the very last day of the 60s. Since then it has been an everlasting love affair.\u201d Even in his final years, Frank\u2019s heart remained in the 1960s. \u201cIt is a surreal thought that my images will outlive me, but I\u2019m happy knowing they\u2019ve touched so many.\u201d Florian Habicht is a documentary film-maker based in New Zealand",

      "bodyText": "Women who go into cardiac arrest in public are less likely than men to receive chest compressions from bystanders as people \u201cworry about touching their breasts\u201d, according to a study. The research by St John Ambulance said nearly a quarter of the 1,000 Britons surveyed admitted they were less likely to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on a woman in public, with a third of men worrying they would be accused of \u201cinappropriate\u201d touching when giving CPR to a woman compared with 13% of females. The survey suggests the \u201ctaboo\u201d surrounding women\u2019s chests creates an \u201calarming gender disparity\u201d in access to emergency medical care as only 68% of women are likely to receive CPR from bystanders compared with 73% of men. Previous research has shown that more than 8,200 women in England and Wales could have survived a heart attack if they had been given the same treatment as men, according to an analysis of data from between 2003 and 2013. Jordan Davison, a community experience manager at St John Ambulance, which teaches first aid and emergency medical services, said: \u201cOur message to people is that it is always better to do something than nothing in these circumstances. \u201cRegardless of gender, when it comes to CPR, every \u2018body\u2019 is the same, the technique is the same, and everyone deserves the best possible chance of survival.\u201d According to the British Heart Foundation, more than 30,000 people have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the UK each year, and less than one in 10 survive. But performing CPR and using a defibrillator can more than double a person\u2019s chances of survival. The survey also found that 38% of Britons say they would feel uncomfortable using a defibrillator on a woman as its pads need to be placed on bare skin in the chest area. Nearly half of the male respondents stated they would feel less comfortable using a defibrillator on a woman knowing that they might have to remove her clothing, including a bra compared with 31% of females surveyed. The report suggests appropriate training could address the problem, with 64% of all respondents indicating that they would feel more comfortable performing CPR if they received the right education and support. Chelsea FC women\u2019s captain Millie Bright, who supports St John Ambulance\u2019s campaign to close the gender gap, said: \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience of being at a game when someone suffered a suspected cardiac arrest, and it was terrifying. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that we all take the time to learn how to save a life, as we never know when we might need the help of strangers. \u201cTo learn that as a woman I am more at risk because people are uncomfortable to provide help due to my gender is shocking.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Draconian penalties that caused unpaid carers to rack up thousands of pounds of debt after unwittingly falling foul of benefit rules are to be overhauled, the government has announced.</p> <p>The move comes six months after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/series/carers-allowance-crisis\">Guardian investigation</a> revealed tens of thousands of vulnerable carers were being ordered to <a href=\"https://content.guardianapis.com/atom/media/d36af53a-bbdb-4000-b705-88e1cd16c607\">repay hefty overpayments</a> \u2013 and even threatened with criminal prosecution \u2013 over minor breaches of carer\u2019s allowance earnings limits.</p> <p>The secretary of state for work and pensions, Liz Kendall, said she had commissioned an \u201copen and transparent\u201d independent review of carer\u2019s allowance overpayments to assess how overpayments were allowed to be accrued on such a vast scale.</p> <p>Kendall told the Guardian: \u201cLike many people, I have read distressing accounts in this newspaper from carers who have had to pay back large sums of overpaid carer\u2019s allowance.</p> <p>\u201cCarers have felt shock, frustration and anxiety as a result. Families are often pushed to breaking point just for looking after the people they love. They deserve to be recognised, supported and valued for all they do.</p> <p>\u201cI am determined to be open and transparent about what has happened in carer\u2019s allowance and to learn all the lessons. This review marks a big step forward for unpaid carers, shedding light on this issue so we can put things right.\u201d</p> <p>A series of Guardian articles in recent months revealed what has become known as the \u201ccarer\u2019s allowance scandal\u201d, highlighting the often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/19/unpaid-carer-dwp-prosecution-threat-like-blackmail\">frightening and humiliating punishments</a> imposed on carers by benefits officials, causing public outrage and leading to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/may/17/kate-garraway-persecution-of-carers-has-horrible-echo-of-post-office-scandal\">comparisons to the Post Office scandal</a>.</p> <p>The review, will be headed by Liz Sayce, the former chief executive of the charity Disability Rights UK. \u201cMy work aims to get to the bottom of how overpayments have occurred and how to prevent people who devote such time and care to others facing these difficulties in future,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The review announcement came on the eve of a Westminster opposition-day debate on carer\u2019s allowance called by the Liberal Democrats, whose leader, Ed Davey, has made reforming carer\u2019s allowance a key party policy, and who has been pressing Labour to make changes.</p> <p>Davey, who is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/05/liberal-democrats-election-broadcast-ed-davey-disabled-son\">carer for his disabled teenage son, John</a>, will tell the Commons the benefit is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. He is expected to criticise the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for failing in recent years to do more to prevent carers being hit with overpayments that have left many with huge debts.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a terrible scandal. Tens of thousands of carers have become the victims of a system that is supposed to be there to support them. The last government should have acted then. But it didn\u2019t. So can I urge the government today: act now,\u201d Davey is expected to say.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have for months called for carer\u2019s allowance rates to be boosted and its complex earnings rules overhauled. They have also insisted existing carer\u2019s allowance overpayments \u2013 about \u00a3250m in total owed by approximately 34,500 claimants \u2013 be written off.</p> <p>There are about 5.8 million unpaid carers in the UK who look after ill, disabled or frail loved ones. More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/12/unpaid-carers-uk-poverty-benefits\">1 million are in poverty</a>. About 1 million carers claim carer\u2019s allowance, a weekly benefit worth \u00a381.90 a week. Claimants are allowed to earn \u00a3151 a week from paid work, equivalent to about 13 hours at the national minimum wage.</p> <p>New research indicates as many as one in five of all carer\u2019s allowance claimants had to repay large sums after inadvertently falling foul of the \u00a3151 earnings limit. It also found anxiety and despair among carers \u201cmade to feel like criminals\u201d after they were harshly punished for overstepping earnings limits by as little as \u00a31 a week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/28/dwp-unpaid-carers-told-to-repay-benefits-allowance\">\u2018DWP threatened to send in bailiffs\u2019: the unpaid carers told to repay benefit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Findings from a survey of 12,500 unpaid carers by Carers UK, seen by the Guardian, found of the 40% who claim or had claimed carer\u2019s allowance, one in five said they were hit by overpayments after unknowingly breaching the earnings limit, often because they had been paid overtime or received a bonus.</p> <p>The draconian punishments for breaching earnings limits are notorious among carers: even going \u00a31 over the weekly limit means they must repay the entire benefit. A carer who earned \u00a31 more than the \u00a3151 threshold for 52 weeks, therefore, would pay back not \u00a352 but \u00a34,258.80.</p> <p>One carer told the survey she went \u00a34 over the limit over a four-month period during the Covid-19 pandemic due to wage fluctuations caused by furlough. </p> <p>She said: \u201cI was made to feel like a criminal \u2026 I had to pay nearly \u00a3400 back and was terrified about getting a criminal record. I became very depressed over the stress of this. So horrendous.\u201d</p> <p>Another said: \u201cI earned \u00a31 too much for 19 weeks and have to pay all the carer\u2019s allowance from that time. I ended up using credit cards to cope. I\u2019ve had to give up carer\u2019s allowance to get another job to cope financially. My husband is 70 and on state pension. This is crippling us mentally and physically.\u201d</p> <p>Four in 10 claimants in the survey said fear of the restrictive rules for carer\u2019s allowance and the risk of harsh punishments led them to give up paid work. Some said they had turned down pay rises, and had to forgo paid training opportunities to enable them to retain eligibility for carer\u2019s allowance.</p> <p>One carer told the survey they reluctantly gave up work after 45 years to maintain eligibility for carer\u2019s allowance: \u201cTrying to balance work and home is difficult at the best of times but with caring it is impossible. Some real compassion and common sense to consider what is a reasonable threshold needs to be considered,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Helen Walker, chief executive of Carers UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a scandal that so many carers, who have unwittingly received overpayments, are facing additional stress and anxiety. Many are under huge pressure already and in precarious financial positions due to their caring role.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Draconian penalties that caused unpaid carers to rack up thousands of pounds of debt after unwittingly falling foul of benefit rules are to be overhauled, the government has announced. The move comes six months after a Guardian investigation revealed tens of thousands of vulnerable carers were being ordered to repay hefty overpayments \u2013 and even threatened with criminal prosecution \u2013 over minor breaches of carer\u2019s allowance earnings limits. The secretary of state for work and pensions, Liz Kendall, said she had commissioned an \u201copen and transparent\u201d independent review of carer\u2019s allowance overpayments to assess how overpayments were allowed to be accrued on such a vast scale. Kendall told the Guardian: \u201cLike many people, I have read distressing accounts in this newspaper from carers who have had to pay back large sums of overpaid carer\u2019s allowance. \u201cCarers have felt shock, frustration and anxiety as a result. Families are often pushed to breaking point just for looking after the people they love. They deserve to be recognised, supported and valued for all they do. \u201cI am determined to be open and transparent about what has happened in carer\u2019s allowance and to learn all the lessons. This review marks a big step forward for unpaid carers, shedding light on this issue so we can put things right.\u201d A series of Guardian articles in recent months revealed what has become known as the \u201ccarer\u2019s allowance scandal\u201d, highlighting the often frightening and humiliating punishments imposed on carers by benefits officials, causing public outrage and leading to comparisons to the Post Office scandal. The review, will be headed by Liz Sayce, the former chief executive of the charity Disability Rights UK. \u201cMy work aims to get to the bottom of how overpayments have occurred and how to prevent people who devote such time and care to others facing these difficulties in future,\u201d she said. The review announcement came on the eve of a Westminster opposition-day debate on carer\u2019s allowance called by the Liberal Democrats, whose leader, Ed Davey, has made reforming carer\u2019s allowance a key party policy, and who has been pressing Labour to make changes. Davey, who is a carer for his disabled teenage son, John, will tell the Commons the benefit is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. He is expected to criticise the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for failing in recent years to do more to prevent carers being hit with overpayments that have left many with huge debts. \u201cThis is a terrible scandal. Tens of thousands of carers have become the victims of a system that is supposed to be there to support them. The last government should have acted then. But it didn\u2019t. So can I urge the government today: act now,\u201d Davey is expected to say. The Lib Dems have for months called for carer\u2019s allowance rates to be boosted and its complex earnings rules overhauled. They have also insisted existing carer\u2019s allowance overpayments \u2013 about \u00a3250m in total owed by approximately 34,500 claimants \u2013 be written off. There are about 5.8 million unpaid carers in the UK who look after ill, disabled or frail loved ones. More than 1 million are in poverty. About 1 million carers claim carer\u2019s allowance, a weekly benefit worth \u00a381.90 a week. Claimants are allowed to earn \u00a3151 a week from paid work, equivalent to about 13 hours at the national minimum wage. New research indicates as many as one in five of all carer\u2019s allowance claimants had to repay large sums after inadvertently falling foul of the \u00a3151 earnings limit. It also found anxiety and despair among carers \u201cmade to feel like criminals\u201d after they were harshly punished for overstepping earnings limits by as little as \u00a31 a week. Findings from a survey of 12,500 unpaid carers by Carers UK, seen by the Guardian, found of the 40% who claim or had claimed carer\u2019s allowance, one in five said they were hit by overpayments after unknowingly breaching the earnings limit, often because they had been paid overtime or received a bonus. The draconian punishments for breaching earnings limits are notorious among carers: even going \u00a31 over the weekly limit means they must repay the entire benefit. A carer who earned \u00a31 more than the \u00a3151 threshold for 52 weeks, therefore, would pay back not \u00a352 but \u00a34,258.80. One carer told the survey she went \u00a34 over the limit over a four-month period during the Covid-19 pandemic due to wage fluctuations caused by furlough. She said: \u201cI was made to feel like a criminal \u2026 I had to pay nearly \u00a3400 back and was terrified about getting a criminal record. I became very depressed over the stress of this. So horrendous.\u201d Another said: \u201cI earned \u00a31 too much for 19 weeks and have to pay all the carer\u2019s allowance from that time. I ended up using credit cards to cope. I\u2019ve had to give up carer\u2019s allowance to get another job to cope financially. My husband is 70 and on state pension. This is crippling us mentally and physically.\u201d Four in 10 claimants in the survey said fear of the restrictive rules for carer\u2019s allowance and the risk of harsh punishments led them to give up paid work. Some said they had turned down pay rises, and had to forgo paid training opportunities to enable them to retain eligibility for carer\u2019s allowance. One carer told the survey they reluctantly gave up work after 45 years to maintain eligibility for carer\u2019s allowance: \u201cTrying to balance work and home is difficult at the best of times but with caring it is impossible. Some real compassion and common sense to consider what is a reasonable threshold needs to be considered,\u201d they said. Helen Walker, chief executive of Carers UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a scandal that so many carers, who have unwittingly received overpayments, are facing additional stress and anxiety. Many are under huge pressure already and in precarious financial positions due to their caring role.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "General Sir Mike Jackson, the former head of the British army who commanded troops in the 2003 Iraq war, has died aged 80. The former chief of the general staff died on Tuesday surrounded by his family. Jackson, who was given the moniker \u201cthe Prince of Darkness\u201d for his composed manner and gravelly voice, also served in senior command posts in Kosovo during the 1990s. The British army wrote on X: \u201cIt is with great sadness that we have learnt of the death of General Sir Mike Jackson GCB, CBE, DSO, on 15 October surrounded by his family. \u201cGeneral \u2018Jacko\u2019 served with distinction for over 40 years, finishing his career as Chief of the General Staff. \u201cHe will be greatly missed, and long remembered. Utrinque Paratus.\u201d Born into a forces family, Jackson was commissioned into the army as an officer from Sandhurst in 1963. He transferred to the Parachute Regiment in 1970, serving several tours in Northern Ireland and commanding the regiment\u2019s 1st battalion between 1984 and 1986. The father of three also served in Bosnia. In 1989, while holding the rank of brigadier, he spent six months at Cambridge University as the services fellow at Wolfson College. He completed his thesis only weeks before the collapse of the Berlin Wall. As adjutant of the Parachute Regiment\u2019s 1st battalion, he was present on Bloody Sunday on 30 January 1972 in Derry when paratroopers shot dead 13 protesters during a civil rights march. Jackson made a full apology for the shootings in 2011 and acknowledged the men had been killed \u201cwithout justification\u201d after the publication of the Saville inquiry\u2019s report, which called the incident a \u2018\u2018catastrophe\u2019\u2019 for Northern Ireland. He was appointed chief of the general staff a month before controversial Iraq invasion and was in the role until 2006. Jackson was succeeded by Gen Sir Richard Dannatt and retired from the army after serving for almost 45 years. He was rewarded with a DSO (companion of the Distinguished Service Order) for his \u201chighly successful command and leadership during active operations\u201d in Kosovo, and a fourth star to become commander-in-chief, United Kingdom Land Command. The Parachute Regimental Association said he was a \u201cgreat leader of men\u201d who will be \u201cmissed by many\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2024 to more accurately describe the people shot dead on Bloody Sunday.",

People with nut allergies should not be worried about the spread of allergens through aeroplane air conditioning systems, the academics concluded, but they should ask to be allowed to board first so they can clean their seat area. Experts from Imperial College London and Aviation Medical Consultancy conducted an analysis of studies on nut particles travelling through ventilation systems, to examine the common perception that peanut or tree nut particles can be transmitted through aircraft ventilation systems. Their analysis, funded by the UK Civil Aviation Authority and the UK Medical Research Council, concluded that research studies show \u201cno evidence to support airborne transmission of nut allergens as a likely phenomenon\u201d. \u201cAnnouncements requesting nut bans are not therefore supported, and may install a false sense of security,\u201d they wrote. Airlines should instead give people with allergies \u201cpre-boarding\u201d so they can wipe down their seat area. But the authors said that people at risk of a severe allergic reaction \u2013 also known as anaphylaxis \u2013 should carry two pre-filled EpiPen devices at all times \u2013 including when flying. Airlines should also consider including a separate supply of \u201cgeneral use\u201d adrenaline autoinjectors. Prof Paul Turner, an expert in anaphylaxis and allergy at the University of Sydney and Imperial College London, said: \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be worried about what food is being transmitted in the air when they fly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find any evidence that nut particles could travel through the cabin ventilation system on aeroplanes and cause reactions. The one thing people must do to protect themselves is to clean their seat area. \u201cAllergenic food is really sticky, and can be found on seat surfaces, table tops, and seat-back entertainment screens. People touch these surfaces, and then the allergens can be transferred to their mouths. \u201cIf food-allergic people can board first, and have time to clean their seat area with something like a baby wipe or antibacterial wipe, they are much less likely to have accidental reactions.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re having discussions with a number of major airlines as well as patient groups and anaphylaxis charities to see if we can get some consistent changes in airline policy across airlines operating out of the UK and internationally, to reflect what the evidence is and really make a difference to food-allergic passengers.\u201d Simon Williams, chief executive of Anaphylaxis UK, added: \u201cA key take-home message is the importance of passengers cleaning their seat area, including the tray table and the seat-back entertainment system.\u201d",

Rugby league\u2019s London Broncos, bottom of this season\u2019s Super League, won three of 27 at a rate of one in nine. And the worst team in the NFL, the Carolina Panthers, ended last season 2-15. It doesn\u2019t look good, though at least Scotland didn\u2019t trade away Scott McTominay, Billy Gilmour and Ben Doak for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/16/panthers-to-bench-2023-no-1-overall-pick-bryce-young-and-start-andy-dalton\">Anthony Ralston</a>. Poor <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72IIv04YoA\">Sir Purr</a>.</p> <p><strong>But the thing is, you can push any old argument with data, and that stat doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.</strong> Scotland may have stunk the place out at Euro 2024, but their subsequent Nations League performances have been curate\u2019s-egg level at worst, highly promising if you\u2019re being a little more generous. Steve Clarke\u2019s side have gone toe-to-toe with three nominally better sides in Poland, Portugal and Croatia, playing extremely well for long periods in each match, only to suffer late sickeners every time: a clumsy late penalty here, an equaliser judged millimetres offside there, the all-time relentless nature of the evergreen Cristiano Ronaldo the other.</p> <p><strong>So yes, Scotland could do with some extra quality, it\u2019s true, and at times they\u2019ve been their own worst enemy.</strong> But they could also do with a little bit of luck going their way for once. Portugal, ranked eighth in the world, might not be the best opponents to face when searching for that momentum-shifting break. But Scotland\u2019s barren run has to end sometime, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/mar/28/scotland-v-spain-euro-2024-qualifying-live\">Hampden is where Portugal\u2019s Iberian cousins Spain lost their last meaningful fixture</a>, so why not tonight? Here\u2019s hoping, anyway. <strong>Kick-off is at 7.45pm.</strong> It\u2019s on!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/14/scotland-steve-clark-remain-devoted-despite-tough-moment-nations-league\">Steve Clarke urges Scotland support to remain devoted despite \u2018tough moment\u2019</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Ewan Murray was at Hampden, and his report is in. Here it is! Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night. It\u2019s now one win in 16 for Scotland, and ten matches without victory in competitive fixtures, but at least they\u2019ve snapped a four-game losing run. Tonight\u2019s point also gives them a fighting chance of avoiding automatic relegation to League B. Perhaps most importantly, they didn\u2019t suffer any last-minute heartbreak: a fifth match in a row, after late winners for Hungary, Poland and Portugal, followed by a late disallowed goal in Croatia, would have been too much to bear. A good evening for Steve Clarke and Scotland, then, even if it\u2019s all to be taken in context. Baby steps, small acorns, all that. The other match in Group A1 has finished Poland 3-3 Croatia. The visitors ended the match with ten men, keeper Dominik Livakovi\u0107 sent off for catching Robert Lewandowski with his studs. All of which means the table looks like this tonight. Portugal P3 W3 D1 L0 F7 A3 Pts 10 Croatia P3 W2 D1 L1 F7 A6 Pts 7 Poland P3 W1 D1 L2 F7 A9 Pts 4 Scotland P3 W0 D1 L3 F4 A7 Pts 1 Scotland host Croatia in the first game of the November international break, then travel to Poland for a match which may or may not give them a chance of escaping automatic relegation to League B. Should be a lot of fun, which is something we\u2019ll all need to remind ourselves when we start moaning about the Premier League taking yet another week off. Some weapons-grade petulance by Ronaldo as the whistle goes. He wanted the chance to take the corner, but the clock had ticked over the four-minute mark, so the referee was within his rights to blow for full-time. Ronaldo melts down, ranting at the referee, waving his arms about, giving the Scotland fans a double thumbs-down, before storming off down the tunnel in the highest dudgeon. But never mind that display of eejitry: Scotland thoroughly deserved their point after a resolute defensive display that also produced a couple of very decent chances for Scott McTominay. It\u2019s worth noting that, for all Portugal\u2019s domination of territory and ball, Craig Gordon didn\u2019t have too much to do. Bernardo Silva wins a corner down the right, but there\u2019s no time to take it. The whistle goes, and Scotland have their first point of this Nations League campaign! 90 min +4: Robertson crosses for Dykes. Scotland couldn\u2019t, could they? Nope. But it doesn\u2019t matter because \u2026 90 min +3: The corner leads to McTominay being bowled over, and the whistle goes for a clock-eating free kick. Ronaldo back-heels the ball away petulantly, and is fortunate not to go into the book, though it\u2019s an act that doesn\u2019t exactly do his team any favours with time running out. 90 min +2: A ball comes bouncing into the Scotland box from the right. It falls to Le\u00e3o, who has time to size up a shot from eight yards. He skelps the ball \u2026 only for Devlin to spread himself and block bravely! Out for a corner. 90 min +1: The first of those four minutes goes by without incident. Everyone\u2019s thinking about it, aren\u2019t they? 90 min: Devlin\u2019s first act is to usher a long ball out of play for a goal kick, with the aforementioned Le\u00e3o on his shoulder. There will be four additional minutes. 89 min: Nicky Devlin comes on for his debut, replacing Ralston, who was beginning to be given the runaround by Le\u00e3o at right-back. 88 min: Portugal throw on another couple of players. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix and N\u00e9lson Semedo for Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and Vitinha. 87 min: Le\u00e3o dribbles delicately down the left, leaving Ralston for dust. He cuts back for Fernandes, who slaps a first-time shot towards the bottom left. Gordon drops on the ball and grabs at the second attempt with Ronaldo lurking. 86 min: Bernardo Silva wins a corner down the right. Nothing comes of it, but Scotland can\u2019t get out. They\u2019re holding their shape at the minute, though, which is something. 84 min: Dykes might not be the most sophisticated player out there, but he\u2019s a presence all right. And here he nearly sends McTominay clear with a pass made via the medium of diving header. Intercepted, but let\u2019s dream, and what an assist that could have been! 83 min: Dykes replaces Adams. 82 min: A cross into the Scotland box from the right. Ronaldo brings the ball down, 12 yards out, shifts it from right to left, and lashes a wild shot right of goal. He claims a corner, but isn\u2019t getting one. Dias goes into the book for pressing the point too passionately. 81 min: Portugal continue to hog the ball. The tension at Hampden is now palpable, with Scotland\u2019s first point of their Nations League campaign within touching distance. 79 min: Cancelo curls a deep cross into the Scottish mixer from the right. Gordon rises highest to pluck the ball from the sky. Every defensive effort met with a huge Hampden roar. 77 min: The match suddenly goes basketball, as Scotland counter the counter, Morgan playing a cute reverse pass down the right touchline to release Ralston into acres. He\u2019s got McTominay clear in the middle, but overhits the low cross and McTominay is forced wide left, where the move peters out. Oh my. One way or another, it\u2019s just not happening for McTominay tonight at all. 76 min: \u2026 so for all Portugal\u2019s domination, McTominay has arguably had the best two chances of the evening. What a strange game football can be. Then up the other end, Bernardo Silva jinks his way into space down the right and cuts back from the byline, but somehow misses out Ronaldo, allowing Gilmour to calmly mop up. 74 min: Another huge chance for McTominay! Space for Morgan down the right. He crosses long. Adams heads back across goal instead of going for goal. Not the worst decision, with McTominay shaping to shoot on the penalty spot, but somehow the ball rears up and Scotland\u2019s top scorer takes a fresh-air swipe. 73 min: Robertson commits to a sliding tackle and misses both ball and player entirely. Mendes is able to steal away with the ball and cross, but fortunately for Scotland and their embarrassed captain, the ball sails out of play for a goal kick. \u201cThis now reminds me of a typical SPL game, with Portugal as Celtic and Scotland as, say, Ross County or St Johnstone,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cThe only debate is whether Portugal/Celtic\u2019s winning goal will be scored just before or just after the 90-minute mark.\u201d 71 min: Gilmour\u2019s poor backpass nearly lets in Ronaldo. Gordon rushes to the edge of his box to blooter clear and save his team-mates blushes. 69 min: It\u2019s now 3-3 in Warsaw, Poland levelling things up against Croatia through Sebastian Szyma\u0144ski. Not the best news for Scotland as they dream of avoiding automatic relegation from League A, but not a hope-killer either. 67 min: Scotland make two changes. Doak \u2013 the first 18-year-old to start consecutive games for the Scots since Paul McStay in 1983 \u2013 and Christie make way for Morgan and Gauld. 66 min: McTominay works hard down the right and wins Scotland\u2019s first corner of the game. Robertson swings it into the six-yard box. Hanley gets too close to Costa and the whistle goes for a free kick. 65 min: McLean dribbles out of his own box and looks to break. He\u2019s clipped by Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, cynically from behind, but the Portugal player doesn\u2019t go into the book. The ref feeling generous. 64 min: Portugal are beginning to assert themselves again. The second half unfolding much like the first one did. 63 min: McLean over-elborates in the centre circle and gifts possession to Fernandes, who dribbles hard down the inside-right channel before cutting inside. He\u2019s got options in the box, but gets caught between shooting and crossing, and eventually does neither. McLean breathes a little easier. 61 min: Portugal make a triple change, hooking Jo\u00e3o Palhinha, Jota and the lively Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and sending on Bernardo Silva, Rafael Le\u00e3o and R\u00faben Neves. 60 min: Adams is clipped to the floor and falls on the ball. A wee tussle with Dias ensues. The referee trots over to remind both that they\u2019re grown men. In the meantime, here are some existential musings courtesy of Justin Kavanagh: \u201cPoor Scott McTominay, he escapes a relegation battle at club level to join a top, top Italian team, only to find himself mired in another relegation dogfight at international level. He is the modern-day personification of the footballing Scots\u2019 ability to snatch despondency from the jaws of happiness. I make this observation having spent a wonderful morning at the Scottish Football Museum this week, coming away asking if they offer any therapy for the poor people (thanks Peter!) who work there looking at all those \u2018so-close\u2019 moments on video loop. All day. Every day!\u201d 58 min: Concei\u00e7\u00e3o wins a corner down the right. Fernandes takes a strange one that hits the near post and pings out for a goal kick. Not sure whether Gordon knew what was happening there, or if the ball had curled out of play before clattering the frame of the goal. Either way, that put a few hearts in mouths. 57 min: Souttar sends McTominay into space. McTominay tees up Christie on the edge of the D, but Christie can neither shoot nor shuttle the ball wide left for Robertson. 55 min: Portugal have enjoyed 67 percent of possession so far. And now they\u2019ve got the ball in the net for the first time, but only after Mendes had dribbled the ball clearly out of play down the left and cut back for Ronaldo to tap home. No celebration. Ronaldo knew the score. 53 min: Doak and Robertson combine cutely down the left, the latter swinging a cross in for Adams, who is inches away from getting his head to the ball, six yards out. Maybe it skimmed his eyebrows, it was that close. But the ball flashes out for a goal kick. 51 min: Robertson\u2019s deep outswinging free kick is dangerous, forcing Costa to punch clear in a panic. But then the whistle goes for too much Scottish shoving. Portugal go straight up the other end and nearly score, Concei\u00e7\u00e3o exchanging passes with Ronaldo down the middle before blazing over from the edge of the box. He should have worked Gordon at least. Somewhere in the multiverse, Portugal have gone 2-0 up in double-quick time. 50 min: Doak drops a shoulder to make his way down the inside-left channel at speed, and is hacked down by the hanging leg of Jo\u00e3o Palhinha, who goes into the book. A free kick. Everyone lines up on the edge of the Portugal box. 48 min: Robertson misplaces a pass in the midfield and allows his Liverpool team-mate Jota to tear off down the left. Jota clips back for Ronaldo, in acres on the penalty spot. Ronaldo heads over the bar. Nowhere near. What a chance that was. Ronaldo looks pained, as well he might. The net should have bulged rather than his incredulous eyes. 47 min: All a bit scrappy. Neither team back up to speed yet. Portugal get the second half underway. No changes. Half-time advertising break. Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now! HALF TIME: Poland 2-3 Croatia. No goals at Hampden, but it\u2019s been a different story in Warsaw. Piotr Zieli\u0144ski gave the hosts a fifth-minute lead, only for Croatia to hit back with three goals in seven minutes midway through the half, courtesy of Borna Sosa, Petar Su\u010di\u0107 and Martin Baturina. All good news for Scotland, who really need the Croats to win tonight if they\u2019re to have any realistic chance of avoiding automatic relegation from League A \u2026 but Poland reduced their arrears just before the break through Nicola Zalewski, so everything\u2019s back in the balance. As things stand, Group A1 looks like this. Portugal P3 W3 D1 L0 F7 A3 Pts 10 Croatia P3 W3 D0 L1 F7 A5 Pts 9 Poland P3 W1 D0 L3 F6 A9 Pts 3 Scotland P3 W0 D1 L3 F4 A7 Pts 1 No added time. Scotland quickly make their way down the tunnel to receive some beneficial tactical advice. 43 min: Concei\u00e7\u00e3o slips Cancelo into space down the right. Cancelo dinks a cross in from the byline. Ronaldo is lurking but Gordon half clears. Vitinha meets the dropping ball on the edge of the D and slashes over. Scotland could do with hearing the half-time whistle. 41 min: \u2026 but Portugal come straight back at Scotland, Ronaldo welting a wild attempt miles over the bar from distance. Hampden celebrates by slipping back into panto mode. 40 min: Concei\u00e7\u00e3o in acres down the right. He\u2019s got options in the middle, or could shoot himself, but attempts a strange cutback to \u2026 well, who? Adams intercepts and clears. 38 min: Scotland get their press going, and Portugal ship possession to McLean, who attempts to find Doak with a right-to-left cross, but seriously overcooks it. A little better from the hosts. 37 min: \u2026 and you\u2019d think there\u2019s no real need for Portugal to be claiming things they don\u2019t deserve, because they\u2019re well on top, and surely an opening goal is only a matter of time. They\u2019re coming at Scotland from all angles, with Concei\u00e7\u00e3o borderline unplayable. 35 min: Hanley ushers a ball rolling very slowly back towards the Scotland box. It makes it just in time for Gordon to claim on the line. Fernandes screams to suggest Gordon had handled the ball out of the box, but that\u2019s clearly not the case, and he\u2019s really trying it on. 34 min: Concei\u00e7\u00e3o is an absolute menace down the right. Yet another cross, this time met by Ronaldo, whose header instigates a quick game of pinball. Scotland clear. Ronaldo claims a penalty for handball, but come on and come off it. 33 min: Scotland started brightly, but they\u2019re having to dig in now. One of the biggest roars for a while as McLean breaks up an attack and blooters clear. 31 min: Yet another Concei\u00e7\u00e3o cross from the right. Jota heads back into the mixer. From the penalty spot, Ronaldo attempts a bicycle kick, which bounces wide right. It\u2019s a free kick, too, Gilmour\u2019s nearby head having been put in mortal danger. 29 min: Portugal\u2019s second kit may be spattered in blue, but squint and the white takes over. Shades of Scotland-England. Hopefully that won\u2019t give the Scottish players any unwelcome flashbacks. (Don\u2019t click if you don\u2019t want to be reminded of it, you know full well what it is.) 27 min: McTominay slides in on Fernandes, studs showing. He catches his former Manchester United team-mate and goes into the book. Ronaldo and Mendes then combine to make a royal hash of the free kick, the latter tapping to the former with too much velocity, the ball pinging off Ronaldo\u2019s boot towards the grateful Gilmour, who clears. Ronaldo has the good grace to laugh at the faux pas. 25 min: Mendes whips the free kick in from the right. Gordon palms over the bar. Fernandes hits the resulting corner long from the left, and it\u2019s easily hoofed clear. Portugal cranking up the pressure, though. 24 min: Mendes hoicks the free kick in dangerously. Somehow on an arc that evades Ronaldo, Jota and Cancelo, all six yards out. But Concei\u00e7\u00e3o retrieves the ball on the other flank, and is upended by Ralston. There\u2019s another dangerous free kick coming in. 23 min: Christie barges into Mendes again, this time conceding a free kick just to the left of the Scotland box. Danger here. 21 min: There\u2019s a little bit of an edge developing here. Martinez loses the place again, this time over a garden-variety foul by Christie on an in-flight Mendes. Presumably he wants the Scotland man booked. It\u2019s not happening. 20 min: The resulting free kick, sent into the Portugal box from the right, is only half cleared and drops to Christie, who catches a shot well from the edge of the D. Unfortunately it\u2019s straight at Costa, who gathers without fuss. 19 min: Adams and Christie are both skittled amid a mele\u00e9, and it\u2019s another free kick for Scotland. Ronaldo isn\u2019t happy about the decision and has a long chat with the referee. Roberto Martinez isn\u2019t that happy either, getting involved with the fourth official on the touchline. All a bit out of proportion. 18 min: Jota goes into the book for standing on Christie\u2019s foot. It was a foul, sure, but a yellow card seems a bit harsh. Jota was competing for the ball and it didn\u2019t look premeditated. 16 min: Concei\u00e7\u00e3o tries for Jota again. Again. Scotland just about deal with it, then Cancelo nearly high-kicks Robertson in the head, and the whistle goes to give Scotland a chance to regroup. 15 min: Concei\u00e7\u00e3o is causing all sorts of problems down the right. Again he crosses long, again Jota lurks at the far stick, again Ralston is forced to head behind for a corner. Fortunately for Scotland, again the Portuguese corner is nothing to write home about. 13 min: Portugal are beginning to find their feet after Scotland\u2019s confident start. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o wins a corner off Robertson down the right. Fernandes cuts this one back and what follows is a textbook example of over-thinking and over-playing. 12 min: Fernandes swings the corner into the six-yard mixer, but Gordon punches clear. 11 min: Concei\u00e7\u00e3o dribbles into the Scotland box from the right. He dinks towards the far post for Jota, but Ralston holds the Portugal striker at arm\u2019s length and eyebrows out for a corner. That\u2019s good defending; had Ralston not stood firm, it would have been a close-range chance for Jota. 9 min: Christie spins to slip Ralston into space down the right. He crosses low for Adams, but the ball clanks into the first Portugal defender. Unlucky. A fine move that was started by McTominay\u2019s drive down the middle. 8 min: Ronaldo\u2019s second and third touches of the ball elicit more loud booing. This is just begging for retribution, isn\u2019t it. And indeed not long after, he\u2019s taking his first whack at goal, from the left-hand edge of the Scotland D. A trundler that\u2019s easy enough for Gordon. 6 min: Fernandes swings a ball into the Scottish box from the let. It sails miles over Ronaldo\u2019s head and into the arms of Gordon. 4 min: Scotland should be leading. McLean takes a quick free kick to release Doak down the left. Doak cuts back for Robertson, who crosses. McTominay is free, six yards out, but the Hampden goal machine slaps a weak header straight at Costa. What a chance! 3 min: Nuno Mendes\u2019 poor backpass allows McTominay to break into the Portugal box. He can\u2019t get a decent shot away, and the flag goes up anyway, Ralston having clattered Antonio Silva to ensure McTominay was able to get away. 2 min: Some early nerve-settling possession for Scotland. Then Portugal take over and get a feel of the ball. Ronaldo has his first touch and cops for some pantomime pelters. A minute of applause in memory of former First Minister Alex Salmond, who passed away on Saturday \u2026 then Scotland kick off. A rousing atmosphere at Hampden. The trademark roar. The teams are out! A pyro party on the touchline as Scotland and Portugal take to the pitch. The home heroes in dark blue, Portugal in their white and sky-blue-flecked change kit. We\u2019ll be off in a minute or two, once folk have been sent home to think again. Pre-match postbag. \u201cPortknockie has a charming ring to it,\u201d writes the MBM\u2019s resident paronomasiac Peter Oh. \u201cAs for the match, I shudder to think how many goals Port. will knockie into the goal.\u201d Aye, here\u2019s hoping Scotland manage to stay Afloat. (A niche reference there for the Banffshire cognoscenti.) Meanwhile Simon McMahon adds: \u201cI\u2019m extremely hopeful that Scotland can secure a famous victory tonight. If nothing else, the law of averages says that we\u2019re due a result, but then again the same law convinced me that we were winning Euro 24, that we\u2019d elect some politicians who weren\u2019t completely out of their depth or lining their own pockets, and that I\u2019d stay sober for at least one month this year. We\u2019ve still got November and December, right? Undoubtedly the two best months for sobriety. If you include Anthony Ralston\u2019s loan spell, there are three (former) Dundee United players in the Scotland starting XI tonight. Plus Ryan Gauld on the bench. You can do this, Scotland. Just like you did back in 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1992 1996 1998 2021 2024. What was I saying about the law of averages?\u201d Portugal make six changes to the side sent out to beat Poland 3-1 at the weekend. Diogo Jota, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Vitinha, Jo\u00e3o Palhinha and Ant\u00f3nio Silva step up. Meanwhile, though Roberto Martinez has spoken of managing 39-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s minutes carefully, Portugal\u2019s 133-goal striker starts. A reminder of how Scotland have got themselves into their latest scrape: a 2-3 home defeat to Poland, a 2-1 loss in Portugal, and defeat by the same scoreline last weekend in Croatia. All of which means the Group A1 table looks like this \u2026 Portugal P3 W3 D0 L0 F7 A3 Pts 9 Croatia P3 W2 D0 L1 F4 A3 Pts 6 Poland P3 W1 D0 L2 F4 A6 Pts 3 Scotland P3 W0 D0 L3 F4 A7 Pts 0 In tonight\u2019s other game in A1, Poland welcome Croatia to Warsaw. Scotland make one change to their starting XI in the wake of the 2-1 defeat in Croatia. Ch\u00e9 Adams takes the place of Lyndon Dykes up front. There are quite a few players on the bench hoping to earn their first cap tonight: Rangers midfielder Connor Barron, Aberdeen defenders Nicky Devlin and Jack MacKenzie, Preston centre-half Liam Lindsay, West Ham midfielder Andy Irving, and goalkeepers Jon McCracken and Robby McCrorie, of Dundee and Kilmarnock respectively. John McGinn, Kieran Tierney, Aaron Hickey, Scott McKenna, Lewis Ferguson, Lawrence Shankland and Angus Gunn are all absent through injury. Scotland: Gordon, Ralston, Souttar, Hanley, Robertson, Gilmour, McLean, Christie, McTominay, Doak, Adams. Subs: McCracken, McCrorie, Barron, Dykes, MacKenzie, Irving, Porteous, Lindsay, Morgan, Nisbet, Gauld, Deviln. Portugal: Costa, Mendes, A Silva, Dias, Cancelo, Vitinha, Palhinha, Fernandes, Jota, Ronaldo, Concei\u00e7\u00e3o. Subs: Velho, R Silva, Semedo, Dalot, Trinc\u00e3o, B Silva, F\u00e9lix, Veiga, J Neves, Ot\u00e1vio, Le\u00e3o, R Neves. Referee: Lawrence Visser (Belgium). The top-line statistic makes for grim reading: Scotland have won just one of their last 15 matches. That solitary victory doesn\u2019t bring much succour either, coming as it did in an extremely unconvincing 2-0 against Gibraltar, a landmass roughly similar in acreage to that infinitely more picturesque rock, the Bow Fiddle, plus neighbouring fishing villages Portknockie, Findochty and Cullen. If that (admittedly delicious) statistic isn\u2019t damning enough, here\u2019s some more context. Derbyshire, who came last in cricket\u2019s County Championship this year, won one of 14 games. Rugby league\u2019s London Broncos, bottom of this season\u2019s Super League, won three of 27 at a rate of one in nine. And the worst team in the NFL, the Carolina Panthers, ended last season 2-15. It doesn\u2019t look good, though at least Scotland didn\u2019t trade away Scott McTominay, Billy Gilmour and Ben Doak for Anthony Ralston. Poor Sir Purr. But the thing is, you can push any old argument with data, and that stat doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Scotland may have stunk the place out at Euro 2024, but their subsequent Nations League performances have been curate\u2019s-egg level at worst, highly promising if you\u2019re being a little more generous. Steve Clarke\u2019s side have gone toe-to-toe with three nominally better sides in Poland, Portugal and Croatia, playing extremely well for long periods in each match, only to suffer late sickeners every time: a clumsy late penalty here, an equaliser judged millimetres offside there, the all-time relentless nature of the evergreen Cristiano Ronaldo the other. So yes, Scotland could do with some extra quality, it\u2019s true, and at times they\u2019ve been their own worst enemy. But they could also do with a little bit of luck going their way for once. Portugal, ranked eighth in the world, might not be the best opponents to face when searching for that momentum-shifting break. But Scotland\u2019s barren run has to end sometime, and Hampden is where Portugal\u2019s Iberian cousins Spain lost their last meaningful fixture, so why not tonight? Here\u2019s hoping, anyway. Kick-off is at 7.45pm. It\u2019s on!",

      "bodyText": "Two boys recently died at separate Halloween-themed haunted hayride attractions in tractor accidents, authorities said. The first boy died about 10.45 pm on 11 October at the Haunted Hilltop Halloween event in Hamilton county, Tennessee. A group of children at the event were playing near a path through which hay ride tractors drove, the Hamilton county sheriff\u2019s department said. A chaperone for the group told sheriff\u2019s deputies that the children were \u201cbehind some bushes trying to scare some hay riders\u201d. One of them appeared to have tried jumping on the trailer but slipped, falling under the tractor\u2019s wheels. \u201cApparently a young kid hid in the bushes and crossed over a barrier and when the hayride trailer went by he jumped out and attempted to get on the side of the trailer and was ran over by the trailer,\u201d the attraction said on Facebook, imploring the community to give the boy\u2019s family time to grieve. The Chattanooga Times Free Press identified the victim as Samuel Jessen, 12. A GoFundMe was organized to help the Jessens with funeral costs. A similar tragedy unfolded just before 8pm on 12 October at the Harvest of Horror Haunted Hayride attraction in St Augusta, Minnesota. Alexander Mick, 13, appears to have been run over by a wagon that was pulled by a tractor, the Stearns county sheriff\u2019s office said in a statement. While attendees and first responders tried to save the boy\u2019s life, he died at the scene. His mother, Teri Mick, reportedly described her late child as \u201can amazingly unique child who loved Jesus with all his heart\u201d. \u201cHe was full of life, a junior black belt in taekwondo, played drums for the worship team, he was in band, sang in choir, in robotics and soccer and almost was an Eagle Scout,\u201d she told CBS News. The attraction said in a statement on its website that they\u2019re \u201ccooperating fully with the authorities and are grateful for their support\u201d. \u201cWe are deeply shaken by this event and are asking for thoughts, prayers and support for the family and friends of the individual involved and all those affected by this tragedy,\u201d they said. Out of respect to the family involved, the organizers made the decision to cancel the remaining nights of the 2024 Harvest of Horror. Hayrides grew popular in the late 19th century with urban families increasingly partaking in leisure travel, according to the Northern Kentucky Tribune. Tourists decamping cities for the countryside had read \u201cidealized accounts of hayrides in children\u2019s books\u201d and countryside farmers acted on this, pitching authentic hayrides, per the publication. These rides, which involved spreading hay in a wagon, were a popular pick for farmers. There was more money to be made offering rides to \u201csummer people\u201d compared to selling the hay outright. While there are voluntary safety standards for hayride operators, meaningful regulation remains scant, the Tribune notes. White Hutchinson, a company that consults in agritourism, said in 2023 that US hayride accidents have caused a minimum of 24 deaths and 204 injuries since 2000.

The 3,800-seat Bradford Live building was due to open in November but performances were cancelled when NEC Group, which runs a number of large venues in and around Birmingham, pulled out of the deal. The venue, a supposed centrepiece of Bradford city of culture 2025, is now standing empty while the council, which will foot the majority \u2013 \u00a344m \u2013 of the bill looks for another company to take the helm. The fiasco has echoes of Co-op Live, the new Manchester arena whose launch in April was marred by lengthy delays, cancelled gigs and rescheduled performances, eventually opening in May. A joint statement by Bradford council and NEC Group in September said a decision had been made by the company that \u201cthe venue will be better served by an alternative operator\u201d. NEC Group has not commented further on what brought about the decision, other than to say the company would focus on its existing business in the Birmingham area \u201cafter a strategic review of its business\u201d. The council\u2019s Labour leadership has faced backlash from within the council; the councillor Rebecca Poulsen, leader of the Conservative group, labelled the saga a \u201ccomplete embarrassment, to the council and to the city\u201d. Ahead of a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the full council on Tuesday afternoon, she said she was concerned the building \u201ccould sit there for years empty\u201d and there was a lack of transparency from the council in its negotiations with NEC Group and other potential operators, which meant the deal that fell through could not be scrutinised. She added: \u201cThe more public money that has gone into it, the more secretive everything has become. It\u2019s just like a secret society or something.\u201d Susan Hinchcliffe, the leader of Bradford council, said it had been \u201cvery frustrating\u201d to have been obliged to keep the negotiations private but that path had been followed after discussions with lawyers. She said the council believed it could come to a deal with one of many similar venue management companies so that Bradford Live could be operational during its city of culture celebration in 2025. She said: \u201cWe are now in a position to have further discussions with them about the opportunity. We can\u2019t say more about this at this stage given the commercially sensitive nature of discussions.\u201d Photographs of the newly refurbished building, which most local people remember as the Bradford Odeon, show sensitively restored original features including a grand regency-revival-inspired ballroom with a vaulted ceiling. Poulsen said there were no concerns among councillors or the public about the quality of the restoration but \u201cwe want it to be open\u201d. The cinema, the first in the UK to be purpose-built for \u201ctalkies\u201d, was the largest cinema outside London when it opened in 1930. It also housed a ballroom, where acts such as the Beatles, the Everly Brothers and the Rolling Stones performed multiple times during the 1960s. It closed in 2000 and fell into severe disrepair, and there were a number of campaigns to save the building over the years backed by celebrities such as Richard Attenborough, George Clarke, David Hockney and Imelda Staunton. The Odeon was sold to Bradford council in 2013 for a nominal price of \u00a31, on the condition that \u00a31.32m would be invested in its upkeep and repair. The vote is in response to a number of issues in the city of Bradford that Poulsen blames on the council\u2019s Labour leadership, including problems with child social care, and \u201cdelay after delay after delay\u201d in other infrastructure projects, including a bus station and the new purpose-built Darley Street market, the opening of which has been pushed back several times and is now not due until spring next year. Bradford council is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and earlier this year central government agreed a \u00a3220m package of loans over the next two years, and allowed the council to use money made from selling assets, such as land and buildings, to support its day-to-day operations. At the council meeting on Tuesday, Hinchcliffe blamed swingeing Tory cuts to councils, made while increasing the responsibility of councils in expensive areas such as social care. She said Tory governments had taken hundreds of millions from Bradford council and left the city with \u201ca hole in the ground, a regeneration company that delivered nothing and a crumbling Odeon building\u201d. She described the vote of no confidence as a \u201cphoney motion\u201d designed to create a crisis at the council where there was not one.",

The reptile appeared in the top of the fifth inning of the Dodgers\u2019 7-3 loss to the New York Mets. It wasn\u2019t big enough to put a scare into anyone. \u201cI was hoping it was a rally snake and we turned a rally around right after that,\u201d the reliever Brent Honeywell said. \u201cBut just something to get the boys moving a little different [after] everything else.\u201d The snake was wrapped in a towel and removed by a member of the grounds crew. \u201cWe\u2019ve had Snakes on a Plane, Snakes on a Train and the latest Hollywood hit: Snake in the Dugout,\u201d joked Fox\u2019s play-by-play commentator Joe Davis. The visitor didn\u2019t have the impact of the goose that landed on the field at Dodger Stadium during another playoff game, in 2022. (It was also wrapped in a towel and taken away; a team representative told the Los Angeles Times it was released but didn\u2019t offer details.) That goose was celebrated as a good-luck charm for the San Diego Padres, who went on to win the division series against their rivals. Padres fans dubbed it the Rally Goose, not to be confused with the St Louis Cardinals\u2019 Rally Squirrel, who scurried across home plate in the city in 2011 and caused a commotion. The Cardinals won that playoff series and the World Series afterward. Other animals have been less a auspicious presence. Perhaps the most famous in baseball history is a goat who, with his human companion, was kicked out of a Chicago Cubs game in 1945. The human later sent a telegram to the Cubs\u2019 owner declaring a curse on the team. The Cubs lost the World Series that year and didn\u2019t win it again until 2016. What, exactly, the snake portends is unclear \u2013 the Dodgers began scoring runs after its appearance, but they still lost the game. \u201cI got out there, and he\u2019s up in the corner \u2013 nobody could get him out of there,\u201d Honeywell told MLB.com, which pointed out that the same player had also encountered an alligator in a Florida minor-league dugout in 2015. \u201cBut that\u2019s what we need every now and again \u2013 to see some crazy stuff like this.\u201d The Associated Press contributed reporting",

      "bodyText": "Morning everyone. Universities have warned students not to fall for the \u201cmanipulative\u201d recruitment tactics of the Shincheonji church \u2013 a Korean religious sect that former members describe as a cult, and which is increasingly active on Australian campuses. The federal government is stepping up its crackdown on consumer rorts with \u201cdynamic ticket pricing\u201d and other dodgy practices in the crosshairs; the US has delivered an ultimatum to Israel over Gaza aid; and the Socceroos win a priceless point in Japan. Plus: why did Donald Trump dance for 40 minutes at his latest campaign rally? Australia Ticket trap | The \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d of concert tickets will be banned as the federal government cracks down on \u201cdodgy\u201d trading practices and tackles hidden fees and subscription \u201ctraps\u201d for online shopping, gym memberships and airline tickets. The government also plans to ban debit card fees and we look at when that will happen and how it fits with the overall review of bank payments. ANU pay \u2018delusion\u2019 | The Australian National University is asking staff to forgo an agreed pay rise \u2013 a request the union says will do nothing to stave off a potential 638 job cuts and only reveals the chancellery\u2019s \u201ccomplete mismanagement and delusion\u201d. Flight of fancy? | Climate campaigners have asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate whether \u201cfly carbon neutral\u201d and other sustainability claims by Qantas are misleading or deceptive. Visa question | The government\u2019s new temporary humanitarian visa pathway for Palestinians fleeing the conflict in Gaza is a welcome first step, advocates say, but they warn the three-year option to stay is not good enough for those who have no home to return to. \u2018Supremely confident\u2019 | A One Nation candidate running in the Queensland election has likened Covid-19 vaccination to the Holocaust in comments condemned by medical experts and a Jewish community leader. World Canada-India spat | An Air India plane bound for Chicago has made an abrupt landing in the Canadian Arctic city of Iqaluit after a false bomb threat. The emergency stop came less than a day after Canada and India expelled senior diplomats in a widening feud between the two countries. Aid ultimatum | The US may stop giving Israel weapons unless it lets more humanitarian aid into Gaza, the Biden administration has warned in a letter to Israeli leaders. Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office has said that Israel will decide alone on the form of any retaliation to Iran\u2019s barrage of 180 missiles fired at the country earlier this month, although it would listen to advice from Washington. Follow developments live. \u2018It\u2019s a miracle\u2019 | A Russian man survived more than two months drifting in icy seas on an inflatable boat in an ordeal that claimed the lives of his brother and teenage nephew, officials and reports said. Energy easing | Global oil prices have tumbled by almost $3.50 a barrel amid more evidence China\u2019s economy is slowing and as fears ease about the possibility of an attack by Israel on Iran\u2019s energy facilities. Folie de film | Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is on course for a catastrophic financial loss of up to US$200m as its dismal box office run continues. Dancing Donald | Opposition outrage over Donald Trump\u2019s rabble-rousing demagoguery turned to bewilderment after the Republican nominee spent 40 minutes swaying to his favourite songs at a rally near Philadelphia. Full Story The Marles-Tarnawsky dispute Political editor Karen Middleton speaks to Reged Ahmad about why Richard Marles\u2019 chief of staff, Jo Tarnawsky, decided to share her story about allegedly being effectively sacked by phone and what it means for parliament\u2019s already maligned workplace culture. In-depth Bree\u2019s sister Anna has been involved for several years with Australian branches of the Shincheonji church \u2013 which former members describe as a \u201cdoomsday cult\u201d. She says her sister, who was recruited by the group at university but has since dropped out, spends most of her waking hours on church activities, often not returning home until after midnight. \u201cShe\u2019s so tired that she\u2019s doing stuff like burning food,\u201d Bree told Guardian Australia. \u201cShe\u2019s been in a collision with other vehicles in two incidents.\u201d Several universities such as ACU have recently warned students to be wary of the \u201csecretive\u201d and \u201cmanipulative\u201d recruitment tactics used by members of the church on campus. The Australian branch of Shincheonji did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia, but international chapters have previously denied the church is a cult. Not the news With Grammy wins, Coachella sets and sold-out tours, Australian dance artists such as R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol, Dom Dolla and Flume have won millions of fans all over the world. Jack Tregoning examines whether it\u2019s just a question of right place, right time, or whether it is the flowering of something \u201cuniquely Australian\u201d. The world of sport Socceroos | Australia scrapped their way to a 1-1 draw with Japan in Saitama last night to keep their hopes of qualifying for World Cup 2026 on track. Cricket | England made a shock exit from the T20 World Cup after the West Indies handed them a six-wicket defeat. Meanwhile in the men\u2019s game, a debut century by Kamran Ghulam\u2019s gave Pakistan a boost as they aim to bounce back in the second test in Multain, ending day one on 259-5. Football | The English FA is in advanced talks with Thomas Tuchel over appointing him as the next England manager. Media roundup A \u201cwitches\u2019 brew\u201d of preferences will decide the Melbourne council elections, the Age reports. The Australian Financial Review asks if Anthony Albanese\u2019s house purchase might be his \u201cHawaii moment\u201d in reference to his predecessor Scott Morrison\u2019s much-criticised holiday decision. Michael Ferguson\u2019s resignation as state treasurer indicates another shift of power in Tasmania\u2019s parliament, analysis in the Mercury claims. What\u2019s happening today Economy | Reserve Bank assistant governor Sarah Hunter to deliver a speech at in Sydney at 9am. Canberra | National Press Club address by Australian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram. Queensland | State election leaders\u2019 debate at 1pm.

When asked whether he had talked to Vladimir Putin after the end of his presidency, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t \u201ccomment on that, but I will tell you that if I did, it\u2019s a smart thing\u201d. \u201cIf I\u2019m friendly with people, if I can have a relationship with people, that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d he said. Trump was also asked about his stance on the Federal Reserve, specifically on comments he has made against Fed chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump first appointed in 2018. \u201cI think if you\u2019re a very good president with good sense, you should at least get to talk to [the Fed],\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think I have the right to say, as a very good businessman \u2026 I think you should go up or down a little bit. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should be allowed to order it, but I think I have the right to put in comments as to whether or not interest rates should go up or down.\u201d Even a recommendation from the White House as to what the Fed should do with interest rates would amount to a significant step away from the central bank\u2019s long-established independence. Trump frequently made personal jabs at Micklethwait, saying \u201cI know you\u2019re an anti-tariff guy\u201d and at one point: \u201cThis is a man who has not been a big Trump fan.\u201d",

Downing Street has denied that Starmer received the free tickets as a \u201cthank you\u201d for the singer getting a police escort to her concerts. \u201cI completely reject that characterisation,\u201d his spokesperson said. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately up to the police to take operational decisions in relation to these big events.\u201d Starmer declared the tickets, worth \u00a32,800, to the final night of the Eras tour in London in line with the parliamentary rules, but later paid them back following weeks of criticism over accepting thousands of pounds worth of freebies. No 10 has faced repeated questions over the decision to give Swift and her entourage a police convoy by the Special Escort Group (SEG), a specialist unit of the Metropolitan police usually reserved for the royal family and senior politicians. Downing Street says the move, which came after the pop star pulled out of three planned concerts in Vienna when police foiled a terror plot, was an operational matter for police. However, the police decision was reportedly changed after representations from Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, about the economic repercussions if the huge concerts were called off. Starmer\u2019s spokesperson did not deny that No 10 potentially had had conversations with Swift\u2019s team, saying \u201cconversation and dialogue\u201d about such security matters was completely routine. Among the donations Starmer repaid was \u00a3598 for two tickets to Swift\u2019s Wembley concert five days earlier, paid for by the Football Association, which owns the stadium. He did not attend this concert, with the register of MPs\u2019 interests saying these were \u201coffered to and accepted by family members\u201d. Cooper also attended one of Swift\u2019s Wembley concerts with her husband, the former Labour minister Ed Balls, who was offered tickets by the star\u2019s record company. For weeks, senior Labour politicians have been dogged by criticism over gifts and hospitality declared by Starmer and other frontbenchers. He had declared more than \u00a3100,000 of freebies, including the Swift tickets and \u00a3698 worth of Coldplay tickets in Manchester. It had looked as though Labour had managed to finally draw a line under the accusations with a vow to close a loophole that meant different rules applied to what ministers had to declare and what MPs had to declare. Downing Street has grown increasingly frustrated at what it regards as \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d with the last Tory government, which took hundreds of thousands of pounds of freebies and oversaw billions worth of Covid contracts being given to cronies. However, some government insiders have acknowledged that the public is holding Labour ministers to a higher standard, after they won the election promising they would run the country in the service of working people, and be different from their predecessors.",

Tests are offered free by the RFU, Premiership Rugby and the RPA. A judge dismissed Rylands Garth\u2019s claim. Rylands Garth represents 295 former professional and amateur players including the World Cup winners Steve Thompson, Phil Vickery and Mark Regan. A spokesperson for Rylands Garth said: \u201cWe welcome the SRA looking into this matter. We have provided detailed paperwork to all players who have approached us about undertaking advanced tests and scans when concerned about their health. In several hundred cases the players were given the all-clear, so did not join the proceedings nor did they pay anything for the testing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves has told the cabinet that the UK still faces a \u00a3100bn black hole in the public finances over the next five years amid concerns that ministers are yet to grasp the full scale of the fiscal deficit ahead. At a meeting of the political cabinet, the chancellor said the \u00a322bn gap this year \u2013 which the government has blamed on their poor economic inheritance from the Tories \u2013 would be a recurring cost each year of this parliament. Cabinet ministers have pushed back against some of the cuts demanded of them, in particular to in-year capital spending, and Reeves\u2019s words will be interpreted as a signal that she will not back down. \u201cThe chancellor highlighted the \u00a322bn black hole inheritance from the previous government that needed to be filled just to keep public services standing still,\u201d a Labour spokesperson said. \u201cShe said that the scale of inheritance meant there would have to be difficult decisions on spending, welfare, and tax \u2013 and that the long-term priority had to be unlocking private sector investment to drive economic growth. \u201cThe chancellor told cabinet the budget would focus on putting the public finances on a strong footing and being honest with the British people about the scale of the challenge.\u201d Treasury sources said internal calculations showed that the huge in-year sum, which Reeves announced in July, was a conservative estimate of the amount of money needed to cover the cost of areas including public sector pay, support for Ukraine and the asylum system. \u201cMinisters do kind of know that we\u2019ll need to fix the black hole every year, but because they see these things through the lens of their own departments, it feels they haven\u2019t really clocked that the scale of the challenge at the budget is so much worse than we expected,\u201d a source said. The downbeat assessment came with a warning that \u201cthis is not a budget for rabbits\u201d, with government aides trying to manage expectations of what the chancellor will be able to deliver in her long-awaited first fiscal statement. Instead, the budget will be presented as a longer-term down payment on \u201cfixing the foundations\u201d of the country, as the government uses all the levers at its disposal to grow the economy. Ministers have signalled that the government is pushing ahead with plans to borrow tens of billions of pounds extra for infrastructure investment by changing how it calculates the fiscal rules. Areas for capital spending were expected to include rail and roads, money to invest alongside businesses such as gigafactories and renewable energy projects, and more investment in improving schools and hospitals. At the same time, Reeves is expected to reaffirm Labour\u2019s fiscal rule that there will be no borrowing for day-to-day spending, rebranding it their \u201cgolden rule\u201d, to shore up confidence in the markets. It is an echo of Gordon Brown\u2019s guideline that over the economic cycle, the government would borrow only to invest and not to fund current spending.",

      "bodyText": "Wes Streeting is to hand Alan Milburn a lead role in the running of his health ministry, in a move that has reignited the row over Labour figures with private interests having access to government. The health secretary is preparing to appoint Milburn, who was a radical reformer of the NHS in his time in that post under Tony Blair, as the lead non-executive director of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). That will give Milburn an official position after months when he has caused disquiet at the DHSC and NHS England by attending meetings of both organisations despite having no formal role, such as that of a minister or special adviser. It will formalise the ex-health secretary\u2019s longstanding status as a key adviser to Streeting as he seeks to drive through his promised \u201cthree big shifts\u201d in how the NHS operates. But the Conservatives criticised the move as \u201cjobs for the boys\u201d and said it showed that Labour view government business as \u201ca gravy train for your mates\u201d. Milburn\u2019s strong belief in using private healthcare to tackle the NHS treatment backlog and the fact that he is a consultant to various companies could trigger claims that his role at the DHSC puts him at risk of being exposed to conflicts of interest between his public and private sector activities. Streeting is expected to announce Milburn shortly as one of three new non-executive directors (NEDs) joining his department\u2019s board, to provide \u201cthe collective strategic and operational leadership of DHSC\u201d. Interviews for the roles \u2013 which involve two or three days work a month and are paid \u00a315,000-a-year \u2013 are being held on Friday 25 October. \u201cAlan Milburn\u2019s a shoo-in to join the DHSC board.

But he has been without an official role since Keir Starmer won the election in July and been operating since then as what one Conservative source called \u201can unregulated adviser\u201d. In his post-election informal advisory role he has also had access to DHSC documents, the Sunday Times reported last month. One health policy expert, who used to work at the DHSC, said: \u201cThere is a recognition that they need to formalise Milburn\u2019s role so he can do more directly, particularly on the new strategy function that brings bits of DHSC and NHSE together to work on the [forthcoming NHS] 10-year plan and three shifts. \u201cA NED or lead NED role at DHSC is an obvious route for that.\u201d Milburn\u2019s appointment will revive concerns about access to government given to people who are closely associated with Labour and also have private interests. Since taking power, Starmer\u2019s government has faced controversy for briefly giving a No 10 pass to Labour donor Waheed Alli, a businessman with media interests who also personally funded clothing and accommodation for Starmer.

Yet for the last year, Israel has treated it as an inconvenience at best and adversary at worst. UN peacekeepers are literally in the path of its offensive in Lebanon and are refusing to leave as it has urged. The Israel Defense Forces forcibly entered a base and have repeatedly fired on their positions, injuring five. Nearly 230 aid workers for Unrwa, which supports Palestinians, have been killed in Gaza.

The Italian interior ministry confirmed on Monday night that 16 men \u2013 10 Bangladeshis and six Egyptians \u2013 who it said had arrived from Libya and were rescued on Sunday in international waters by the Italian coastguard were on board a navy vessel heading to the port at Sch\u00ebngjin.</p> <p>Some EU leaders have previously criticised schemes for external processing of asylum seekers, such as the previous UK government\u2019s deal with Rwanda, but there is now growing appetite in the EU for a similar approach. Germany, once a relatively liberal voice on migration, has become more hawkish and is thought unlikely to block such initiatives.</p> <p>Von der Leyen also praised the EU\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/13/european-commission-accused-of-bankrolling-dictators-by-meps-after-tunisia-deal\">controversial deals with Tunisia</a> and joint work with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/30/european-politicians-accused-of-conspiring-with-libyan-coastguard-to-push-back-refugees\">Libyan authorities</a>, which have been widely condemned by human rights groups. She said irregular arrivals on the central Mediterranean route were down two-thirds in 2024 so far, which she attributed largely to these agreements.</p> <p>The Italy-Albania pact, which human rights associations say is in breach of international law, was signed by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama, in November last year.</p> <p>Meloni said at the time that in exchange for Rami\u2019s backing for the centres, she would do everything in her power to support Albania\u2019s accession to the EU.

      "bodyText": "The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has called for an exploration of \u201creturn hubs\u201d outside the EU in a letter to the bloc\u2019s national leaders on irregular migration, citing a deal between Italy and Albania as a possible model. EU leaders are to meet on Thursday and Friday for a summit on migration as the commission has said it will propose new measures. Irregular migrants and asylum seekers arriving in Europe last year numbered less than a third of the 1 million people arriving in 2015 but it remains a very sensitive topic, influencing elections in most European countries and increasing far-right voter sentiment. Germany, wary of a public opinion backlash against irregular migration before elections next September, has introduced border controls with all its neighbours, suspending the freedom of the passport-free Schengen zone. France, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Italy and Slovenia have also introduced border checks. Italy\u2019s agreement with Albania, an EU candidate country, is for it to host migration centres to process claims by male asylum seekers seeking to enter the union. The first people to be sent to Albania under the controversial migration deal are due to arrive on Wednesday. The Italian interior ministry confirmed on Monday night that 16 men \u2013 10 Bangladeshis and six Egyptians \u2013 who it said had arrived from Libya and were rescued on Sunday in international waters by the Italian coastguard were on board a navy vessel heading to the port at Sch\u00ebngjin. Some EU leaders have previously criticised schemes for external processing of asylum seekers, such as the previous UK government\u2019s deal with Rwanda, but there is now growing appetite in the EU for a similar approach. Germany, once a relatively liberal voice on migration, has become more hawkish and is thought unlikely to block such initiatives. Von der Leyen also praised the EU\u2019s controversial deals with Tunisia and joint work with Libyan authorities, which have been widely condemned by human rights groups. She said irregular arrivals on the central Mediterranean route were down two-thirds in 2024 so far, which she attributed largely to these agreements. The Italy-Albania pact, which human rights associations say is in breach of international law, was signed by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama, in November last year. Meloni said at the time that in exchange for Rami\u2019s backing for the centres, she would do everything in her power to support Albania\u2019s accession to the EU. At talks in Luxembourg on Tuesday on Albania\u2019s negotiations to eventually join the EU, Rama said, however, that his deal with Italy may not be easily replicated by other countries. Von der Leyen said in her letter: \u201cWe should \u2026 explore possible ways forward as regards the idea of developing return hubs outside the EU, especially in view of a new legislative proposal on returns.\u201d As part of the Italy-funded deal, three facilities were formally opened in Albania last week: a centre with a capacity to host 880 asylum seekers, a pre-deportation centre known as a CPR with 144 places, and a small prison with 20 places. In-depth screening of the men will be carried out when they disembark in Sch\u00ebngjin, after which they will be taken to a centre at a former Albanian air force site in Gjad\u00ebr, where the men will be held while waiting for their asylum applications to be processed. \u201cWe have been asked by others and we have said no,\u201d Rama told reporters, pointing to the long history of close Italy-Albania ties. The deal will cost Italy \u20ac670m (\u00a3560m) over five years. The facilities are being run by Italy and will fall under Italian jurisdiction. Albanian guards will provide external security. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was criticised by human rights groups and his Labour party backbenchers after expressing \u201cgreat interest\u201d in the migration pact during a meeting with Meloni in Rome last month while vowing to send \u00a34m to support her crackdown on irregular migration. Meloni once said Italy should repatriate migrants and then \u201csink the boats that rescued them\u201d. In the past she has also called for a naval blockade of north Africa. Elsewhere in the EU, Poland, which has presidential elections due in May, wants to temporarily suspend asylum rights for those crossing over from Belarus, a Russian ally, in a move many see as violating the EU\u2019s charter of fundamental rights. And Finland, faced with people pushed across the border from Russia, suspended such asylum rights in July.",

And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing: rather than allow England spinners to bowl, they\u2019ve gone for them immediately and, as I speak, Matthews retreats in her crease and drills Glenn\u2019s second ball through point for four! A two and a one follow, then Matthews knocks over cover for another single which allows Joseph, 49 not out, to raise a brilliant, brave 50, her first for West Indies in T20 internationals; they call that timing.

Well, welcome to the opposite of that.</p> <p>England have won all three of their matches so far, beating South Africa \u2013 the next-best side in the group \u2013 and Bangladesh pretty handily, before devastating Scotland. And yet, thanks to the vagaries of net run-rate, if they lose today, it\u2019ll be West Indies \u2013 devastated by South Africa before handily beating Scotland and Bangladesh \u2013 who move into the last four.</p> <p>And make no mistake, Hayley Matthews\u2019 team are more than capable of making that happen \u2013 especially on a surface likely to be slow. Matthews, Stafanie Taylor \u2013 if fit - Shemaine Campabelle and the returned Deandra Dottin all have the power to defeat the track and outfield and, more generally, the nature of T20 cricket allows for one player to have a day out and decide a match. West Indies are a live dog and then some.</p> <p>England, though, are bouncing. With the bat, they have numerous talents able to deliver transcendent performances while, with the ball Sophie Ecclestone is bowling so well it\u2019s almost unfair \u2013 and the rest of the attack isn\u2019t bad either.</p> <p>All of which sets up what should be a terrific match \u2013 and in the event of a tie, progress will be determined by which team can name more foods that start with the letter \u201cQ\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTljpx9ix18\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fTljpx9ix18?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-15T13:47:06.394Z\">at 2.47pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Aha, Raf Nicholson\u2019s match report is with us: Which means we\u2019re done here. Thanks all for your company; peace out. And just live for your delectation: From earlier: England, then go out of the competition on net run-rate: they, West Indies and South Africa finish on six points, so 1.091 v 1.536 v 1.382 respectively is what makes the difference. Matthews reckons her team will have surprised a few people, praising Joseph\u2019s batting in particular. But they\u2019ve not won anything yet, so they\u2019ll take tomorrow off then get ready for the semi. She says her team can improve in the field but produced a near-perfect performance \u2013 her side have been running into form over the last few matches \u2013 and she got exactly what she wanted on the occasion of her 100th T20i. Knight is frustrated but congratulates West Indies who played well. She thinks England\u2019s total wasn\u2019t far off, but they bowled a little short and agaon, she credits her opponents. She\u2019s not too badly hurt, at least, but she\u2019ll be hurting something fierce. Aside from Knight\u2019s injury, England will also wonder how things might\u2019ve gone had Dunkley caught Joseph in the second over. But West Indies were better in every aspect, so we can\u2019t identify one or two things as crucial. Australia v South Africa (Thursday 17 October, 3pm BST) West Indies v New Zealand (Friday 18 October, 3pm BST) Qiana Joseph is given player of the match and, having promised a dance, she gives us one, slapping thighs and turning. Her captain told her to \u201cbat herself\u201d \u2013 good advice, for all of us all of the time in any situation \u2013 and didn\u2019t she just. She backed herself, made sure to hit the ball, and feels really happy, so thanks Jesus and her teammates for supporting her. She can bat a lot better than this too, I daresay. They celebrate properly too, screaming, bouncing and hugging, while Heather Knight wipes tears from her eyes. She\u2019ll be so disappointed she got hurt \u2013 I can\u2019t say that was the turning point because of how well West Indies played, but had she stayed out there, things might\u2019ve gone very differently. We said when the teams came out that West Indies looked ready, and goodness me, weren\u2019t they just?! They bowled well, fielded superbly with Dottin\u2019s contribution \u2013 three catches and a run out, which sounds like Jerome K Jerome\u2019s next novel \u2013 and batted like lunatics. 18th over: West Indies 140-4 (Henry 0, Alleyne 8 ) Target 142 Look at that! Alleyne creams her first ball through cover \u2026 and her fourth! An expletive brilliant performance, absolutely steaming in every aspect. England were, I\u2019m afraid, rotten. Surely not?! Well no, of course not. But Dottin looks to lap Ecclestone away but wanders too far across, hears the noise, and off she goes. West Indies need six from 16. Yup, at last some decent fielding: smart work from Capsey at point, hurling flat, and from Jones behind the stumps. 17th over: West Indies 136-2 (Campbelle 5, Dottin 27) Target 142 Sciver-Brunt restores herself to the attack, for all the good it does her team. Her first three balls yield a one, a two, a wide and a three, the rate taken care of by the halfway stage of the over, and when Campbelle hammers back to the bowler, the ball ricochets to the unfortunate Bouchier, the cosmos victimising her for its evil pleasure, she misses with her shy. Gosh, she\u2019s had a day. Next delivery, just six required to win, now Dottin wants a quickie, and this time the throw, from Capsey, is good, Jones breaks the stumps, and I think that\u2019s out \u2013 for all the difference it makes. We go upstairs\u2026 16th over: West Indies 128-2 (Campbelle 3, Dottin 22) Target 142 Dean replaces Glenn and begins with two dots, amping up the pressure just a tad. So Dottin, champion that she is, moves back and across, helping a full-toss for four through square-leg, before going down on one knee to shovel six over midwicket! What a match she\u2019s having, this intervention probably ending England\u2019s hopes ... AND SHE\u2019S STOMPED THEM INTO THE GROUND NOW! Oh my days what a shot this is! She gets down low to get under the ball, she\u2019s falling, leaning bac and almost horizontal b the time she astonishes six over midwicket! Sixteen off the over, 14 from 24 to win! This has been a ferocious assault from West Indies, their calculated power, aggression and bravery far too much for England. 15th over: West Indies 112-2 (Campbelle 3, Dottin 6) Target 142 Bell returns with two new batters at which to go, and could really do with shifting at least one of these two \u2013 though a maiden would also be handy. The first two balls yield singles, but there\u2019s a sense things are getting a little frenetic, Campbelle demanding a quick single that isn\u2019t there \u2026 but Bouchier misses with her shy. I fear a long night of the soul awaits her; I hope her mates are there to keep her company. Two singles follow, and we see images of the Saffers celebrating their progression before a dot means four from the over. West Indies 30 from 30 to reach the semis. 14th over: West Indies 108-2 (Campbelle 1, Dottin 4) Target 142 Something we know for sure: Dottin won\u2019t be cowed by this situation and after two balls to acclimatise, she slams four over extra, the only runs off the over. West Indies require 34 runs from 36 balls. England are catching catches! It\u2019s an epidemic! Matthews looks to pull but doesn\u2019t get all of it, picking out Gibson running in from long on. She slides in on her knees to hold a decent effort, giving her team the barest sniff\u2026 13th over: West Indies 104-1 (Matthews 50, Campbelle 1) Target 142 Glenn returns to the attack\u2026 13th over: West Indies 104-1 (Matthews 50, Campbelle 1) Target 142 Campbelle gets off the mark immediately then Matthews opens the face, earns one to fine leg, and that\u2019s her 50! Well batted Skip! West Indies need 38 runs from 42 balls. What on earth! England hold a chance! Joseph again swings for the fence, but this time it\u2019s Wyatt waiting on the fence and she ends a gloriously lusty and brave knock. 13th over: West Indies 102-0 (Matthews 49, Joseph 52) Target 142 Oh Maia. Oh mate. This is hard to watch now. Sciver-brunt back into the attack and Joseph goes hard again, Bouchier is on the long off fence, the ball\u2019s face-height, arriving nicely \u2026 and she grasses her third chance, hiding face, twisting lips \u2013 all the stuff we\u2019ve all done when experiencing shame, horror and fury. Sport is hard. 12th over: West Indies 102-0 (Matthews 49, Joseph 52) Target 142 Matthews takes a lie-down, struggling with cramp, for all it matters; when Ecclestone returns to the attack, she bunts down the ground for one. Joseph then forces to long on \u2013 not what she intended, but her power means that she can get the ball away even when the connection is poor, and they run one more. Then Matthews checks a shot, allowing ball to hit bat, and when it loops up \u2026 it once more drops short. Two singles complete the over and West Indies need 40 runs from 48 balls. 11th over: West Indies 98-0 (Matthews 47, Joseph 50) Target 142 Towards the end of the England innings, Dan Norcross speculated that they had either 40 runs too many or 40 runs too few, the inference that West Indies would either bat well and win well or bad badly and lose badly, rather than make the match close. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing: rather than allow England spinners to bowl, they\u2019ve gone for them immediately and, as I speak, Matthews retreats in her crease and drills Glenn\u2019s second ball through point for four! A two and a one follow, then Matthews knocks over cover for another single which allows Joseph, 49 not out, to raise a brilliant, brave 50, her first for West Indies in T20 internationals; they call that timing. We said earlier that often in these situations, it\u2019s someone you don\u2019t expect who settles things rather than a superstar; what we\u2019re seeing here is both, and it\u2019s expletive magniiiificent. 10th over: West Indies 89-0 (Matthews 39, Joseph 49) Target 142 Dean returns, and after a dot she directs one at Joseph\u2019s feet, only for another free swing to send it towards Bouchier on the midwicket fence \u2026 and again she can\u2019t hold on. This was a much harder catch than the one she dropped earlier, the ball hit higher and harder, but she won\u2019t feel any better about having tipped it over the bar and over the rope for six; she\u2019s having an absolute mare, I\u2019m afraid, and it\u2019ll take a while for her to get over this. A single follows from the final ball, and at the halfway stage, West Indies need 53 runs from 60 balls. This feels five to over. 9th over: West Indies 81-0 (Matthews 38, Joseph 42) Target 142 England go to Bell again, so Joseph throws hands at her opening delivery, directed into the pads; she again slices, the ball dropping short of deep backward square. Her hitting hasn\u2019t often been clean, but the sheer gusto of it is overriding her technical missteps and it\u2019s fantastic to behold. A leg-side wide follows \u2013 that is pressure \u2013 but Bell responds well enough, ceding two singles from the remaining four deliveries of the over. 8th over: West Indies 77-0 (Matthews 37, Joseph 40) Target 142 Sarah Glenn into the attack, and I guess if England can manage a few well below the required rate \u2013 hard when it\u2019s 5.60 \u2013 the pressure might mount. Two singles come from her first two balls, then Joseph misses with an almighty hoik across the line. No matter: she goes again next ball and this time gets enough of it, Bouchier running around the fence and diving to catch, only to see the ball disappear through her hands. This is, I\u2019m afraid, a devastatingly poor performance from England \u2013 but biggup West Indies, who\u2019ve put the pressure on from ball one of the match, before attacking like mad from the start of their own innings. 7th over: West Indies 70-0 (Matthews 36, Joseph 34) Target 142 West Indies now need 75 runs from 84 balls, and it\u2019s almost impossible to see how they lose this; they\u2019ve enough runs such that 20 overs of batting will surely see them home, and it seems extremely unlikely that England bowl them out inside 14. But this is a better over from Ecclestone \u2013 the best in the world saw her first disappear for eight \u2013 ceding just three singles. 6th over: West Indies 67-0 (Matthews 35, Joseph 32) Target 142 Dean returns, and how England must be rueing the injury to their captain. With Knight at the crease alongside Sciver-Brunt, England would surely have posted a higher total, but that cannot excuse how some of their wickets were given away, nor the poverty of their bowling. And, as I type, Matthew pounces on a drag-down, larruping four over square-leg then, offering another short one, she goes back and mass-murders four more over mid-off and ends the powerplay with a third four of the over hoisted off the pads and over square-leg. This is devastating behaviour from West Indies, England\u2019s bowling handled with minimum fuss and maximum prejudice! 5th over: West Indies 55-0 (Matthews 23, Joseph 32) Target 142 Sciver-Brunt restores herself to the attack and though her first ball only yields one, Matthews nudging to midwicket for a single, her second, far too wide, is launched over the off-side by Joseph for four more! AND GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME! When she unloads the suitcase yet again, she sends one high into the air \u2026 and when it comes down three weeks later, poor Capsey drops a dolly! Surely this is West Indies\u2019 day! England are wilting, and following a single, Matthews gets back in on the act, another short one eased for four to fine leg! This is an absolute kicking \u2026 so far. Can England find something? 4th over: West Indies 44-0 (Matthews 17, Joseph 27) Target 142 Yup, it\u2019s Ecclestone, and Joseph, who\u2019s having a right touch today, top-edges a sweep, the ball again dropping short \u2013 this time of Bell at fine leg. And what on earth! We said one day-out could settle this, and Joseph might just be the one to have it! First, she slaps through square leg for four, then massacres over it for four more! There\u2019s not that much finesse about her batting, but her eye is a very serious thing and when to that you add her power, you understand why she\u2019s threatening to take this match away from England. No more runs come from the over, but with two boundaries from its first three balls, it barely matters. 3rd over: West Indies 36-0 (Matthews 17, Joseph 19) Target 142 Sciver-Brunt has seen enough, introducing the off-breaks of Charlie Dean, and already that looks the right call. First, Matthews spanks fresh air into another dimension, then slices kist short of Gibson, running on from long-on! BUT HAVE A LOOK! Joseph waits, gets down on one knee, clears the pad, and absolutely annihilates six over the long midwicket boundary! England only managed one in their innings, Windies now have two in 15 balls! Dean comes back fairly well, her final three deliveries yielding three singles, but the over was still worth 10 and England badly need a breakthrough because these two are teeing-off. It\u2019s surely time for Ecclestone. 2nd over: West Indies 26-0 (Matthews 15, Joseph 11) Target 142 Sciver-Brunt opens from the other end and when she offers width first up, Joseph goes at it hard, a thick edge sending fourt through wide third. Goodness me, West Indies are having at this! And it makes sense, cashing in in the powerplay before the spinners come on, and after Joseph plays a similar shot, another edge landing safe and earning two, Joseph goes again, heaving high to the fence at midwicket \u2026 where Dunkley runs past it, hoisting hands too late and from too far away, the ball bursting through them! West Indies have 10 from the first three balls of the over and it\u2019s going for them because Joseph again clears her front pad, hurls hands, and clears backward point, just; they run one then add one more, and this is running away from England. Twelve off the over! 1st over: West Indies 14-0 (Matthews 14, Joseph 0) Target 142 It\u2019s Dunkley who replaces Knight in the field, by the way, but back to the main event, Bell beats Matthews outside off with her first and third deliveries \u2026 except her second is helped around the corner for six over long leg and her fourth is clipped to similar area for four! Both boundary-balls were directed, presumably inadvertently, towards the pads, and the Windies skipper is not for missing out. And have a look! Offered a slot-ball, she stomps down a big front foot and creams fo mo over long off! Brilliant start! Fourteen off the over and already England are under big pressure. Bell has the ball, Matthews to face. Here we absolutely go! Here come wa teams, Sciver-Brunt captaining England. Good though she is, they\u2019ll surely miss Knight\u2019s leadership. Actual breaking news: first-dig events mean that South Africa are through. If England win, they\u2019ll finish second and face Australia; if Windies win they\u2019ll finish first and face New Zealand. Breaking news: I did not guzzle the Tony\u2019s Chocolonely, but was so feart I did I escorted it with me to pick-up so I could pass it straight over to its rightful owner. I say that, but Deandra Dottin is a superstar, on one, and will believe, with good reason, that this is her time. When they were put in, England will have wanted more than the 141 with which they ended up. But West Indies will have to take risks to keep up with the rate and, if you\u2019re pushing me, my sense is that England\u2019s bowlers will have enough to restrict them. I\u2019m not surprised it was Knight and Sciver-Brunt who did most the damage for England. Experience and composure is part of the reason why, but so too is skill, and on a track that doesn\u2019t encourage boundaries, the batters able to manipulate the ball are often more useful than those more inclined to whack it hard. Thanks Niall and hi again everyone. This is shaping up isn\u2019t it? 20th over: England 141-7 (Sciver-Brunt 57, Glenn 1) Sciver-Brunt adds a fine four down the ground to reach 57 off 50 as England end on 141-7. Will it be enough to win, and progress to the semi-finals? Find out here, with my esteemed colleague Daniel Harris. Sophie Ecclestone is certainly capable of clearing the fences \u2013 and sends Matthews all the way for six, over deep square leg! She tries again next ball, and this time it drops into Dottin\u2019s lap. Still, a good time for England\u2019s first six of the innings. 19th over: England 128-6 (Sciver-Brunt 52, Ecclestone 1) Dottin is death-bowling in style, a string of yorkers keeping England in check. Knight, back out on the touchline, is urging the pair in the middle to chase some late runs. Not in the short term, no. Gibson looks to clear the infield off Dottin\u2019s delivery, but succeeds only in picking out Fletcher, who takes a sharp catch. 19th over: England 126-5 (Sciver-Brunt 51, Gibson 7) The Windies are penalised for a slow over-rate, with an extra fielder brought into the inner circle for the last two overs. Can the England batters take advantage? 18th over: England 124-5 (Sciver-Brunt 50, Gibson 6) Aaliyah Alleyne comes in, and has the leg-side of the field stacked for Sciver-Brunt \u2013 but struggles for range, with two wides and a leg-bye. Sciver-Brunt then finds gaps in said leg-side twice to complete an excellent 50 off 45 balls. 17th over: England 110-5 (Sciver-Brunt 40, Gibson 5) The trusty sweep shot has been key for England again today, and Danielle Gibson chips in with a nice reverse effort for four. Charlie Dean never really settled and gets reeled in by Fletcher, stretching outside off-stump and sending it directly to the Windies captain, Hayley Matthews. 16th over: England 104-4 (Sciver-Brunt 39, Dean 5) Sciver-Brunt continues at her run-a-ball pace as England pass the century mark. If she can stay in, a decent target is within reach. 15th over: England 96-4 (Sciver-Brunt 35, Dean 1) Charlie Dean comes in next \u2013 and should be gone first ball, mistiming and sending a top-edge into the air. Chedean Nation is underneath it but lets it slip through her fingers. What a let off! Ah, what was I saying? Jones top-edges a fizzing Fletcher delivery straight to Dottin at backward point. That\u2019s a soft one, and puts England back under pressure \u2026 14th over: England 93-3 (Sciver-Brunt 33, Jones 7) The better news for England is that Jones has settled immediately, sweeping Ramharack dismissively away for four. Sciver-Brunt runs another four through the over, taking her to 33 off 33 with only two boundaries. 13th over: England 84-3 (Sciver-Brunt 29, Jones 2) Amy Jones sees out the over, with Dottin restricting the batters to hard-earned singles. Knight is still really struggling to run, and after Sciver-Brunt takes a single, the captain decides she can\u2019t continue! She leaves the field on 21, with Amy Jones replacing her. That\u2019s a big blow for England with this partnership having put them on top. 12th over: England 79-3 (Sciver-Brunt 26, Knight 21) Hayley Matthews returns seeking another wicket, and looks to have Sciver-Brunt lbw first ball \u2013 but the umpire says no, and the West Indies have no reviews left! The DRS replays show it was plumb as it gets \u2013 that one\u2019s going to sting. We then have a mid-over break as Knight needs a bit of treatment from the physio. She\u2019s struggling with her movement, but solves that problem with a reverse sweep for four, helped by a rare bit of clumsy fielding. A strong over for England. REVIEW: Not out! Knight is saved by the bottom edge of her bat, which caught the ball before it hit her pads. That\u2019s a second review lost for the West Indies, although you can understand why they took the chance. 11th over: England 70-3 (Sciver-Brunt 24, Knight 14) This partnership really could be key to England\u2019s hopes, and although there are some uncertain moments on the run, Sciver-Brunt keeps things moving with a lovely sweep off Munisar. On the last ball of the over, the bowler thinks she has Knight lbw, though \u2013 and while given not out, the Windies will take it upstairs \u2026 10th over: England 61-3 (Sciver-Brunt 16, Knight 13) Thanks Daniel, and hello everyone. Deandra Dottin has a bowl for the first time in the tournament, but struggles to find any swing and offers up a pace which suits Heather Knight. The captain finds a gap in the covers for a clinical boundary, as England add seven in the over. We\u2019re halfway through their innings, and time for a drinks break. 9th over: England 54-3 (Sciver-Brunt 14, Knight 8) Knight will fancy herself a captain\u2019s knock here and look at that! She twinkles down to Fletcher\u2019s first delivery, stroking four through cover, then keeps things moving by turning one to midwicket. A dot follows, then three more ones, making it eight off the over, the partnership now 20 off 17, and England are looking a little better. These two have the experience, firepower and moxie to take the game away from West Indies, but another wicket or two and things will look totally different. Righto, I\u2019m away for the school run \u2013 here\u2019s Niall Mcveigh to do me a major solid and coax you through the next hour. 8th over: England 46-3 (Sciver-Brunt 12, Knight 2) Alleyne into the attack and Knight twizzles two to midwicket, Dottin escaping with a misfield that doesn\u2019t allow an extra run; might this be her day? Two singles follow, then Sciver-Brunt leaps across her stumps to flip four over her shoulder having anticipated a delivery on her legs; great shot and a boundary on which Englangd were ganting. 7th over: England 38-3 (Sciver-Brunt 5, Knight 1) Sciver-Brunt takes two to midwicket, then Knight adds a single as England begin the rebuild. The ball pitched outside leg. But West Indies\u2019 spinners are enjoying this. 7th over: England 35-3 (Sciver-Brunt 2, Knight 1) There\u2019s no one England would prefer coming in next than Heather Knight, whose composure might allow others to hit around her. She gets away with one to long on then, when Sciver-Brunt faces, she comes down the track wanting to turn to leg, but the ball is too close to her and she wears it on the pad. Not out, says the umpire when West Indies appeal \u2026 so Matthews goes upstairs\u2026 Trouble for England! Fletcher tosses up her loosener and Bouchier indulges in a swipe, a leading edge sending the ball high \u2026 and straight to Joseph at extra! West Indies are all over it! 7th over: England 34-2 (Bouchier 14, Sciver-Brunt 2) It\u2019s impossible to overestimate the significance of Dottin\u2019s fielding. Not just because she broke what was developing into a decent partnership, but because she changed the energy in the middle. Fletcher into the attack\u2026. 6th over: England 34-2 (Bouchier 14, Sciver-Brunt 2) Sciver-Brunt comes down and forces one to deep square, the only run from the first four deliveries of Matthews\u2019 over. And when the two remaining balls yield just a single, the sense is that West Indies are on top \u2026 for now. 5th over: England 32-2 (Bouchier 13, Sciver-Brunt 1) Sciver-Brunt bumps down the ground to get off the mark. England can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned! Bouchier opens the face and yanks Capsey through for a run this isn\u2019t there but Dottin is on the move far sooner, swooping, hurling over the stumps, and allowing Campbell to do the rest. That is excellent fielding, and this is intense stuff. 5th over: England 23-1 (Bouchier 13, Capsey 1) A single to each batter opens the over. 4th over: England 29-1 (Bouchier 12, Capsey 0) Eight runs and a wicket off the over. We\u2019ve seen a few sliced drives and this is another, Wyatt-Hodge again looking to ascore behind square on the off-side. But Dottin, who moved herself there earlier in the over, is a different proposition to Fletcher, whom she replaced and dives forward to grab a decent grab. 4th over: England 29-0 (Bouchier 12, Wyatt-Hodge 16) Time for spin as Matthews brings herself on, Wyatt-Hodge carving under Fletcher\u2019s dive at point for two. And when she\u2019s offered a little width next up, an open face allows her to guide past gully for four. Six off the over and only two balls gone: pressure! So Matthews goes around the wicket and Wyatt-Hodge knocks to point, hauling Bouchier through for a single \u2026 and Dottin\u2019s throw hits the top of the bails! West Indies like it, but when we go upstairs we see the batter made it, just. 3rd over: England 21-0 (Bouchier 11, Wyatt-Hodge 9) Again, Bouchier goes for a big shot and again she slices it, this time to backward point, but this time the ball drops safe and the batters run two. A single follows, then Wyatt-Hodge hoiks behind the wicket on the off-side for two more; I said earlier I thought England would take care not to get into trouble seeking a score that\u2019s larger than necessary but I was wrong and, as I type, Bouchier retreats to hump Henry over mid on for four. Ten off the over and England are moving. 2nd over: England 11-0 (Bouchier 4, Wyatt-Hodge 6) It\u2019s Zaida James opening from t\u2019other end, once Matthews has rejigged the field a little; there\u2019s a really good energy about her, and her team look alive. Wyatt-Hodge then bumps a single to long on, then Bouchier comes down and tries a drive only to slice her shot and the ball\u2019s falling nicely for Munisar at cover-point \u2013 she missed the run-out opportunity in the first over \u2013 to dive forward and complete a redemptive snaffle. BUT SHE GRASSES IT! Dearie me, that is going to sting because it wasn\u2019t a difficult chance, and a single to Bouchier followed by two twos to Wyatt-Hodge won\u2019t have her feeling any the less extremely, horrifically, soul-curdlingly poorly. 1st over: England 4-0 (Bouchier 3, Wyatt-Hodge 1) Bouchier puts bat on each of the first two deliveries but picks out fielders, then forces to mid-on and sets off for a KP-style Red-Bull single \u2026 making her ground, just. If the diving underarm shy had hit, she\u2019d have been gone. But she\u2019s not, so when Wyatt-Hodge hauls her second ball around the corner for one, she\u2019s back on strike to pick a yorker off her toes and turn to midwicket for two. Solid enough start from both sides. Chienlle Henry has the ball, and here we go! Out come the fielders \u2026 and here come England\u2019s openers. Heather Knight is absolutely buzzing, grinning with eyes shining. She can\u2019t wait, and I daresay you\u2019d feel pretty decent about life trotting out behind her. Anthem time. How much better would this be if West Indies was reggae or dancehall and England\u2019s was jungle or grime? England\u2019s openers are both in nick, having knocked off the 110 needed to beat Scotland in 10 overs. This, though, is a very different affair, on a very different track. And here come our teams! Oh man, I cannot wait for this. Gerronwidit! West Indies will be concerned that Taylor isn\u2019t fit. Not only does he have the firepower to settle this match, but she also has the experience and composure required to excel in an effective knockout tie. That increases the pressure on Matthews, Campbell and Dottin, but it feels like these matchers are as often settled by someone surprising than by one of the big guns. I know Knight was pretty coy about her desire to bowl first, but this is definitely the kind of pitch on which it helps to chase, using the opposition to deduce what constitutes a par total. It\u2019s hard to force the pace on a track likely to be slow, but England won\u2019t want to run out of wickets seeking a higher target than necessary, and my sense is that they take care, knowing they\u2019ve the spinners to twirl them home if that\u2019s what this takes. England: Maia Bouchier, Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Alice Capsey, Nat Sciver-Brunt, Heather Knight (capt), Amy Jones (wk), Danielle Gibson, Charlie Dean, Sophie Ecclestone, Sarah Glenn, Lauren Bell West Indies: Hayley Matthews (capt), Qiana Joseph, Shemaine Campbelle (wk), Deandra Dottin, Chinelle Henry, Chedean Nation, Zaida James, Ashmini Munisar, Aaliyah Alleyne, Afy Fletcher, Karishma Ramharack West Indies also make two changes, but Matthews can only recall that Taylor drops out with Chedean Nation coming in. Heather Knight would also have fielded, but says the pitch looks OK and she\u2019s happy to bat first. England make one change, the now-healthy Alice Capsey replacing Sophia Dunkley. Thus it\u2019s Bell not Smith completing their attack. Hayley Matthews says her side have been successful doing that in the tournament and this year. Waiting in the semis: Australia will face the runners-up in the group \u2013 SA if England win and Windies if Windies win\u2013 with the group winners, England if England win and otherwise SA \u2013 must take on Australia. In an attempt so not to do, I am now chugging green juice: kale, blueberries, ginger, carrots, turmeric. Welcome to middle age, population: me. A further question: do I have the willpower not to guzzle the Tony\u2019s Chocolonely my daughter thinks she\u2019s hidden for herself? I said below that only one of these two sides can progress, but that\u2019s not strictly true. If West Indies win, they and England qualify ahead of South Africa if: They lose by one run and West Indies\u2019 first-innings total is between 87 and 134. They lose by two runs chasing between 61 and 96. They bat first and West Indies win with one or two balls to spare. Gorrit? A question: who will England pick today, Linsey Smith or Lauren Bell? It was Smith in the first two matches and she returned 2-11 then 1-32, while Bell delivered 1-16 when given the call at the weekend. My sense is that Smith will prevail, but I\u2019d go for Bell; it\u2019s a pretty nice choice to have. Just finished for the day: How often have we found ourselves watching a World Cup grumbling about the lack of jeopardy? Well, welcome to the opposite of that. England have won all three of their matches so far, beating South Africa \u2013 the next-best side in the group \u2013 and Bangladesh pretty handily, before devastating Scotland. And yet, thanks to the vagaries of net run-rate, if they lose today, it\u2019ll be West Indies \u2013 devastated by South Africa before handily beating Scotland and Bangladesh \u2013 who move into the last four. And make no mistake, Hayley Matthews\u2019 team are more than capable of making that happen \u2013 especially on a surface likely to be slow. Matthews, Stafanie Taylor \u2013 if fit - Shemaine Campabelle and the returned Deandra Dottin all have the power to defeat the track and outfield and, more generally, the nature of T20 cricket allows for one player to have a day out and decide a match. West Indies are a live dog and then some. England, though, are bouncing. With the bat, they have numerous talents able to deliver transcendent performances while, with the ball Sophie Ecclestone is bowling so well it\u2019s almost unfair \u2013 and the rest of the attack isn\u2019t bad either. All of which sets up what should be a terrific match \u2013 and in the event of a tie, progress will be determined by which team can name more foods that start with the letter \u201cQ\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>England made a shock exit from the T20 World Cup on Tuesday evening after a rampant West Indies handed them a six-wicket defeat, chasing down their 142-run target in 18 overs \u2013 a margin of victory so substantial that they leapfrogged South Africa on net run rate to top Group B.</p> <p>The win means West Indies now progress to the semi-final on Friday against New Zealand at England\u2019s expense, while South Africa will have to face the reigning champions, Australia, in the other semi-final on Thursday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/oct/15/england-v-west-indies-womens-t20-cricket-world-cup-live\">West Indies knock England out of Women\u2019s T20 World Cup to reach semis \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is West Indies\u2019 first T20 win against England since 2018 \u2013 the same year they last reached the semi-finals of a global tournament \u2013 but recent form mattered not a jot for the Carib\u00adbean underdogs who managed the feat even with one of their leading players, Stafanie Taylor, out injured.</p> <p>This win was master\u00adminded instead by Deandra Dottin \u2013 the player who unexpectedly reversed her two\u2011year retirement from \u00adinternational cricket in July. On Tuesday night, England were left wishing she had not \u00adbothered, after her electric \u00adfielding \u2013 three catches, a run-out and the wicket of Dani \u00adGibson \u2013 and 27 runs clobbered off 19 balls sealed their place on the plane home.</p> <p>England\u2019s 141 for seven always felt underwhelming at the Dubai ground where three teams have scored 160 or more in this World Cup. Their woes were enhanced when the captain, Heather Knight, retired hurt in the 13th over with a calf injury and failed to take the field for the chase, handing skippering duties to Nat Sciver-Brunt. Knight struggled to hold back tears after the match. </p> <p>\u201cIt was bad timing for me, and tough to watch,\u201d she said. \u201cWest Indies came at us really hard and put us under the pump.\u201d</p> <p>Sciver-Brunt had led a valiant rescue effort with the bat, top-scoring with an unbeaten 57 from 50 balls after England had been 34 for three in the opening seven overs. Even she only narrowly escaped the snare of Dottin: she would have been out lbw for 26 had West Indies not already burned through their two available reviews; instead, the on-field not-out decision stood. </p> <p>But with Knight absent, England displayed the same emotion they had shown the last time their captain went awol during a big tournament in the 2022 Commonwealth Games \u2013 rudderless panic. </p> <p>The West Indies opener Qiana Joseph blindly threw her bat about and was dropped five times, twice resulting in England fielders parrying the ball over the boundary rope. Jon Lewis was seen remonstrating with his players during the 10-over drinks break, but could not prevent Joseph cavorting to a 34-ball 50 shortly afterwards \u2013 her first in international cricket.</p> <p>\u201cI rarely go on the field after a drinks interval, but I went on today to remind them about what we\u2019re all about as a cricket team,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI could see after six overs, a lot of the players starting to drift off. It wasn\u2019t helpful to have our captain off the field \u2013 there was a lot more discussion on the field than would normally happen. I\u2019m gutted and Heather will be really frustrated because she cares so much about English cricket and this England team.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph was finally snaffled in the deep by Danni Wyatt-Hodge while the captain, Hayley Matthews, was caught on the rope six balls later, just after bringing up her own \u00adhalf\u2011century. But Dottin took matters into her own hands, slogging 16 runs off Charlie Dean\u2019s next over.</p> <p>Earlier, despite facing down a pair of England openers last seen bossing a 113-run partnership against Scotland, Dottin had been utterly unfazed in the field. She deliberately placed herself in the firing line of Wyatt-Hodge\u2019s favoured cut shot, and pouched a good low catch at backward point.</p> <p>Five balls later, she ran out Alice Capsey with a smart pick-up and throw to Shemaine Campbelle behind the stumps, before chipping in again with a wicket as England crumbled at the death. This is a player who styles herself as the \u201cWorld Boss\u201d, an epithet which often seems overhyped but on Tuesday, as West Indies celebrated the unlikeliest of wins, the moniker seemed apt.</p> <p>Two matches now stand between the World Boss and the World Cup. It seems unlikely, but such is the delicious unpredictability of this West Indies side that it cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>",

      "bodyText": "England made a shock exit from the T20 World Cup on Tuesday evening after a rampant West Indies handed them a six-wicket defeat, chasing down their 142-run target in 18 overs \u2013 a margin of victory so substantial that they leapfrogged South Africa on net run rate to top Group B. The win means West Indies now progress to the semi-final on Friday against New Zealand at England\u2019s expense, while South Africa will have to face the reigning champions, Australia, in the other semi-final on Thursday. It is West Indies\u2019 first T20 win against England since 2018 \u2013 the same year they last reached the semi-finals of a global tournament \u2013 but recent form mattered not a jot for the Caribbean underdogs who managed the feat even with one of their leading players, Stafanie Taylor, out injured. This win was masterminded instead by Deandra Dottin \u2013 the player who unexpectedly reversed her two\u2011year retirement from international cricket in July. On Tuesday night, England were left wishing she had not bothered, after her electric fielding \u2013 three catches, a run-out and the wicket of Dani Gibson \u2013 and 27 runs clobbered off 19 balls sealed their place on the plane home. England\u2019s 141 for seven always felt underwhelming at the Dubai ground where three teams have scored 160 or more in this World Cup. Their woes were enhanced when the captain, Heather Knight, retired hurt in the 13th over with a calf injury and failed to take the field for the chase, handing skippering duties to Nat Sciver-Brunt. Knight struggled to hold back tears after the match. \u201cIt was bad timing for me, and tough to watch,\u201d she said. \u201cWest Indies came at us really hard and put us under the pump.\u201d Sciver-Brunt had led a valiant rescue effort with the bat, top-scoring with an unbeaten 57 from 50 balls after England had been 34 for three in the opening seven overs. Even she only narrowly escaped the snare of Dottin: she would have been out lbw for 26 had West Indies not already burned through their two available reviews; instead, the on-field not-out decision stood. But with Knight absent, England displayed the same emotion they had shown the last time their captain went awol during a big tournament in the 2022 Commonwealth Games \u2013 rudderless panic. The West Indies opener Qiana Joseph blindly threw her bat about and was dropped five times, twice resulting in England fielders parrying the ball over the boundary rope. Jon Lewis was seen remonstrating with his players during the 10-over drinks break, but could not prevent Joseph cavorting to a 34-ball 50 shortly afterwards \u2013 her first in international cricket. \u201cI rarely go on the field after a drinks interval, but I went on today to remind them about what we\u2019re all about as a cricket team,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI could see after six overs, a lot of the players starting to drift off. It wasn\u2019t helpful to have our captain off the field \u2013 there was a lot more discussion on the field than would normally happen. I\u2019m gutted and Heather will be really frustrated because she cares so much about English cricket and this England team.\u201d Joseph was finally snaffled in the deep by Danni Wyatt-Hodge while the captain, Hayley Matthews, was caught on the rope six balls later, just after bringing up her own half\u2011century. But Dottin took matters into her own hands, slogging 16 runs off Charlie Dean\u2019s next over. Earlier, despite facing down a pair of England openers last seen bossing a 113-run partnership against Scotland, Dottin had been utterly unfazed in the field. She deliberately placed herself in the firing line of Wyatt-Hodge\u2019s favoured cut shot, and pouched a good low catch at backward point. Five balls later, she ran out Alice Capsey with a smart pick-up and throw to Shemaine Campbelle behind the stumps, before chipping in again with a wicket as England crumbled at the death. This is a player who styles herself as the \u201cWorld Boss\u201d, an epithet which often seems overhyped but on Tuesday, as West Indies celebrated the unlikeliest of wins, the moniker seemed apt. Two matches now stand between the World Boss and the World Cup. It seems unlikely, but such is the delicious unpredictability of this West Indies side that it cannot be entirely ruled out.",

It\u2019s about how we can accelerate that process without risking anything from a long-term point of view. I can\u2019t see [the injury] turning around in the short term. He\u2019s a bit frustrated but we want to make sure we do the right thing by him.\u201d Dingwall, a contender to feature in England\u2019s starting midfield, has been nursing a knee issue for a couple of weeks while a third Saint in the national reckoning, Alex Coles, is recovering from a rib injury. On the plus side Sale\u2019s director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, has issued a more positive update on Ford and Curry, both of whom have had an injury-disrupted start to the season. The 31-year-old Ford tweaked a quad muscle against Saracens last month and has spent more time in the Sharks\u2019 coaching box than on the field in recent weeks. Sanderson, though, estimates Ford is still 10 days away from being able to resume playing, which means the fly\u2011half will not have had any competitive rugby for a month when England select their side to face New Zealand on 2 November. Curry, however, topped the Sharks\u2019 tackle count last week in the win against Newcastle and is eager to get stuck in again against Northampton. Sanderson said: \u201cTom Curry is back! He seems in a really good state of mind. I was talking to Tom and he said to me: \u2018I felt like I was 18 again.\u2019 We\u2019ve been working on freeing him up and I feel like we\u2019ve got there.\u201d The injured Wales captain, Dafydd Jenkins, meanwhile, has confirmed he will sit out his country\u2019s entire autumn schedule but is aiming to return for his club Exeter before Christmas. Jenkins also says he is opposed to proposals to introduce a 20-minute red card rather than a permanent sanction when players are dismissed for dangerous or reckless head contact. \u201cThe only way I can look at it is it probably devalues the red card,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI think we\u2019re trying to change rugby so much. There\u2019s no point changing things that don\u2019t need to be changed.\u201d",

Analysts say there is no shortage of military targets that Israel could strike, including many linked to the hardline Islamic Revolutionary Guards. In Iran on Tuesday, Esmail Qaani, a general who commands Iran\u2019s al-Quds force, made his first public appearance for several weeks when he attended the funeral for Nilforoushan. There have been recent rumours that Qaani had also been killed in an Israeli strike or even been detained by Iranian intelligence services hunting spies.

The annual Howden\u2019s Men\u2019s European Football Injury Index has disconcerting figures for all those competitions, however, as the debate over fixture congestion and player workload becomes ever more heated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/15/manchester-city-target-ruben-amorim-as-next-manager-if-pep-guardiola-leaves\">Manchester City target R\u00faben Amorim as next manager if Pep Guardiola leaves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Premier League clubs lost fewer players and minutes to injury than their peers, for example, the overall severity of injuries \u2013 the number of days missed for an injury \u2013 was higher than in Germany, Spain and Italy. The average length of injury layoffs for those experienced by under-21 players was more significant still: at 43.92 days nearly double that of the average convalescence in La Liga, 23.03 days.</p> <p>James Burrows, the head of sport at the insurance brokers Howden, said the report underscores \u201cthe ever-increasing physical demands\u201d made on professional players. \u201cAs fixture congestion intensifies with expanded competitions domestically and internationally, we are seeing more players sidelined for longer periods, with a notable 5% rise in injury costs this season alone,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As for the injuries sustained by younger players, Burrows said figures in earlier years had been attributed to Covid\u2019s effects on squad composition. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what\u2019s driving that [today],\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe view in the insurance industry has always been that the older the player, the more risky, the more challenging the exposure, because older players are generally out for longer, they don\u2019t return necessarily for injuries that younger players do. A lot of what we see now seems to slightly turn that on its head.</p> <p>Howden act as an insurance broker for a number of clubs and governing bodies. Its annual research collates publicly available injury data and matches it against salary calculations made by the company Sporting Intelligence. Calculations in the fourth edition of its report record a total of 4,123 injuries across the five divisions. </p> <p>Although the number of injuries is at a \u201crecord high\u201d, according to Burrows, up from just over 3,000 in 2020-21, the rate of growth has slowed, suggesting a \u201clevelling off\u201d after a boom in injuries post-Covid and the mid-season World Cup of 2022.</p> <p>It was important not to draw \u201cbinary conclusions\u201d from the data, Burrows said, with German football recording most injuries despite having an 18-team division and the longest winter break. \u201cSome of this data will comfortably fit the narrative [of overload],\u201d Burrows said, \u201cbut there are other elements of this that really don\u2019t comfortably fit the narrative.\u201d</p> <p>One further area of uncertainty for clubs is the impact of absence caused by mental health issues or anxiety. Burrows notes that this is a growing area of focus for clubs and insurers.</p> <p>\u201cA massive talking point in our industry at the moment, and not just across football but across the sport and entertainment sector, is how we develop products that address those types of issues,\u201d he said.</p>",

Bundesliga clubs dominate the list of those with most injuries, with a total of 90,547 days lost to injury across the top divisions in Germany, England, Spain, Italy and France. The annual Howden\u2019s Men\u2019s European Football Injury Index has disconcerting figures for all those competitions, however, as the debate over fixture congestion and player workload becomes ever more heated. Although Premier League clubs lost fewer players and minutes to injury than their peers, for example, the overall severity of injuries \u2013 the number of days missed for an injury \u2013 was higher than in Germany, Spain and Italy. The average length of injury layoffs for those experienced by under-21 players was more significant still: at 43.92 days nearly double that of the average convalescence in La Liga, 23.03 days. James Burrows, the head of sport at the insurance brokers Howden, said the report underscores \u201cthe ever-increasing physical demands\u201d made on professional players. \u201cAs fixture congestion intensifies with expanded competitions domestically and internationally, we are seeing more players sidelined for longer periods, with a notable 5% rise in injury costs this season alone,\u201d he said. As for the injuries sustained by younger players, Burrows said figures in earlier years had been attributed to Covid\u2019s effects on squad composition. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what\u2019s driving that [today],\u201d he said. \u201cThe view in the insurance industry has always been that the older the player, the more risky, the more challenging the exposure, because older players are generally out for longer, they don\u2019t return necessarily for injuries that younger players do. A lot of what we see now seems to slightly turn that on its head. Howden act as an insurance broker for a number of clubs and governing bodies. Its annual research collates publicly available injury data and matches it against salary calculations made by the company Sporting Intelligence. Calculations in the fourth edition of its report record a total of 4,123 injuries across the five divisions. Although the number of injuries is at a \u201crecord high\u201d, according to Burrows, up from just over 3,000 in 2020-21, the rate of growth has slowed, suggesting a \u201clevelling off\u201d after a boom in injuries post-Covid and the mid-season World Cup of 2022. It was important not to draw \u201cbinary conclusions\u201d from the data, Burrows said, with German football recording most injuries despite having an 18-team division and the longest winter break. \u201cSome of this data will comfortably fit the narrative [of overload],\u201d Burrows said, \u201cbut there are other elements of this that really don\u2019t comfortably fit the narrative.\u201d One further area of uncertainty for clubs is the impact of absence caused by mental health issues or anxiety. Burrows notes that this is a growing area of focus for clubs and insurers. \u201cA massive talking point in our industry at the moment, and not just across football but across the sport and entertainment sector, is how we develop products that address those types of issues,\u201d he said.",

Little ran footage from cameras worn on officers\u2019 bodies and from vehicles present to claim police were not as close as Blake had said. While Blake alleged the Audi had driven at him, Little said video footage showed it had not. The prosecutor said: \u201cThe vehicle actually drives away from you rather than towards you.\u201d Blake replied: \u201cIt felt like it was coming at me at the time. It certainly made me feel very uncomfortable.\u201d Little then asked the officer if he accepted the vehicle had come to a halt and was stationary when he pulled the trigger. Blake replied he did not know. Later Little said: \u201cYour discharged your firearm without properly assessing the risk in front of you?\u201d \u201cI disagree,\u201d said Blake. Little said: \u201cYou discharged the firearms when you should not have done so, I suggest?\u201d Blake disagreed. The officer told the court he had opened fire not intending to kill, but to incapacitate the driver and stop the vehicle. He said he aimed around the area of the steering wheel: \u201cI aimed my firearm at the central body mass as we are trained to do, over the steering wheel. Obviously I was aware that the bullet would hit his body at some point but I didn\u2019t intend to kill. It was the only way I thought I had at the time to stop the vehicle.\u201d Blake said if he had missed and the vehicle stopped, he would not have fired again, and denied firing deliberately at Kaba\u2019s head. The jury has heard that \u201cperceptual distortion\u201d after stressful and fast-moving events can lead to errors in remembering even key details. Blake said: \u201cMemory after these sort of incidents is always going to be distorted.\u201d The jury was told that in interview with investigators under criminal caution, Blake refused to answer verbal questions, instead providing written answers. Kaba was shot at about 10.06pm on 5 September 2022, and was pronounced dead a little more than two hours later. The trial continues.",

They say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re calling on the government to deliver on its manifesto promise of a proper consultation on the future of the Lords, including via a representative citizens\u2019 assembly, to let the people decide who should be holding politicians to account and making sure laws are sensible and fair.</p> <p>Continuing a system of political appointees risks accusations of cronyism and conflicts of interest. We need a second chamber that makes the most of the views and experience of a much more representative group. </p> <p>We call on the government to announce a timeline for the public consultation on wider Lords reform, and the means for doing it effectively, as soon as possible.</p> <p>We believe that a citizens\u2019 assembly as part of a national conversation would help ensure this public consultation would bring together people from all walks of life, to hear from experts, deliberate and make recommendations to be implemented by the government.</p> </blockquote> <p>The groups that have signed the statement, sent to the Guardian, are: the <strong>Democracy Network, Unlock Democracy, Involve, Citizen Network, Community Organisers, </strong>the <strong>Sortition Foundation, Independent Constitutionalists UK, 38 Degrees, Politics for the Many </strong>and<strong> Compass.</strong></p> <p>In a separate move, almost 300,000 people have signed<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/remove-bishops-from-the-house-of-lords?utm_source=National-media&amp;utm_campaign=HouseofLordsReform&amp;utm_content=Politics&amp;utm_term=1000+&amp;utm_medium=National-petition\"> an online petition</a> at <strong>Change.org</strong> saying the 26 Church of England bishops should be removed from the Lords.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670e8d7a8f0898da3e0b4e1a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-15T16:07:35.653Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dowden says MPs should be 'cautious about rushing into change' as he opposes Labour's hereditary peers bill</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oliver Dowden</strong>, the shadow deputy PM, told MPs that the Conservatives were opposing the bill removing hereditary peers from the House of Lords because they believed in being \u201ccautious about rushing into change\u201d.</p> <p>In his speech in the second reading debate, explaining why the opposition were against the bill (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/15/employers-national-insurance-reeves-starmer-streeting-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-670e67558f0838b423b50ac0#block-670e67558f0838b423b50ac0\">2.07pm</a>), Dowden said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The checks and balances of the <em>Lords</em> \u2013 its tried and tested conventions \u2013 work. The <em>Lords</em> does not claim to be a democratic chamber, and that is the key point, this elected house has primacy.</p> <p>Now, of course, the British constitution does and should continue to evolve, but we should only fix what is broken and be cautious about rushing into change. Our evolution should start with questions of efficacy, not optics.</p> <p>Just as with the Blair and Brown governments before, this government seems obsessed with change for change\u2019s sake. We\u2019ve seen it all before, rebranding spun to give the impression of progress.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also accused Labour of being willing to tolerate MPs getting into the Commons on the basis of family links.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now, one of the central arguments evinced by the paymaster general [Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Labour minister opening the debate] is that no one in parliament should be there by, quote, \u2018an accident of birth\u2019. Yet today\u2019s Labour party reeks of the hereditary principle.</p> <p>The elevation of the nepo babies of north London, the coronation of the red princes\u2026 the Falconers, the Kinnocks, the Benns, the Eagles, the Reeves \u2013 many of them distinguished members, but under Labour\u2019s closed shop, it\u2019s hereditary peers out, hereditary MPs in.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Labour MPs Hamish Falconer, Stephen Kinnock and Hilary Benn are all the sons of former Labour cabinet ministers, while Angela and Maria Eagle, and Rachel and Ellie Reeves are sisters. They all became MPs by being selected in the normal way. Hereditary peers just inherit their titles when a parent, normally their father, dies. The ones who get into the House of Lords now do get elected in, by other peers, but only hereditary peers can stand, and so the competition is very limited.</p> <p>Dowden also said in his speech that he did not expect to remain in the shadow cabinet after the new Tory leader is elected.</p> <p>In his speech, <strong>Thomas-Symonds</strong> defended the bill. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the 21st century there should not be places in our parliament, making our laws, reserved for those born into certain families.</p> <p>In fact, we are one of only two countries that still retain that hereditary element in our legislatures, a clear sign the time has come to see through this long overdue change.</p> <p>And it\u2019s a matter of principle for this government, committed to fairness and equality.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-15T16:09:30.095Z\">at 5.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-670e8b598f088ef4160055cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-15T15:35:33.870Z\">4.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Foreign Office has announced sanctions against three illegal settler outposts and four organisations that have supported and sponsored violence against communities in the West Bank.

Taken together, the two cuts are worth around \u00a318bn in the current financial year.</p> <p>In his article, King says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before the general election, both major parties were irresponsible in either making, or promising not to reverse, <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/2eO6K/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/national-insurance-cut-new-tax-year-b2523695.html\">cuts in national insurance contributions</a>. It was a reckless increase in the future national debt \u2013 an attempt to bribe voters with their children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s pocket money.</p> <p>An honest approach would be to say that such a commitment now appears a mistake and to return national insurance contributions to their previous level. You might be surprised by how many citizens would accept such honesty; better to tackle the problem now and not a year or so before the next general election.</p> </blockquote> <p>King also says that he accepts the case for higher government borrowing in the short term.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you believe that the UK requires higher investment to overcome the perception that \u201cnothing works any more\u201d \u2013 and I do not disagree \u2013 then you should argue for the merits of that \u2026 even if it means higher borrowing for a while.</p> </blockquote> <p>Reeves has signalled that in her budget she intends to keep the government\u2019s debt rule (that it should be falling in the fifth year of the forecast) but change the definition of debt used for this purpose. In his article, King says the rule itself should be changed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The current fiscal rule, that the ratio of debt to national income is <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/2eO6K/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rachel-reeves-resolution-foundation-budget-tax-government-b2628928.html\">projected to fall in the fifth year</a> of the forecast horizon, makes little sense. It is Augustinian \u2013 make me fiscally stable\u2026 but not yet. But not even Saint Augustine believed in a five-year rolling horizon.</p> <p>The problem with the current rule is that it is too loose \u2013 not too tight (do read the <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/2eO6K/https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/175/economic-affairs-committee/news/202788/its-time-for-tough-decisions-to-tackle-our-national-debt/\">House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee report</a> on debt published last month). Your challenge is to justify a temporary Augustinian deviation from the objective of a falling debt to national income ratio, because of the need to finance higher investment without cutting day-to-day public spending.</p> <p>Only a convincing and credible strategy for raising investment while achieving fiscal sustainability by the end of this parliament will help to reduce the upward pressure on long-term interest rates, resulting from higher borrowing.</p> </blockquote> <p>King ends his article by calling a conversation with Reeves at the bank.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember your telling me one day that the reason you enjoyed working at the <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/2eO6K/https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bank-of-england\">Bank of England</a> was the opportunity to work with other very bright young people.

Who\u2019s right?</p> <p>Starmer says <strong>Labour\u2019s manifesto</strong> was \u201cvery clear\u201d. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase national insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is not \u201cvery clear\u201d about the distinction between employees\u2019 NICs and employers\u2019. If anything, it is the opposite \u2013 intentionally ambiguous.</p> <p>But, during the election campaign, the Tories repeatedly challenged Labour politicians to explicity rule out increasing employers\u2019 NICs \u2013 and Labour shadow ministers repeatedly refused to give that commitment. Instead, they just stuck to the wording in the manifesto.</p> <p>As a result, <strong>CCHQ</strong> repeatedly put out press releases during the campaign asserting as fact that Labour did intend to raise various taxes, including employers\u2019 national insurance. For example, on 14 June it released one with the heading \u201cLabour\u2019s 18 tax rises\u201d that started:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Laura Trott, chief secretary to the Treasury, has laid out a raft of new taxes Britain will face under a Labour government.</p> <p>Trott outlined the 18 new tax rises Labour will hit the country with - everything from your home to your car and from your work to your pension.</p> </blockquote> <p>The press released then listed 18 tax rises that it said the Tories had ruled out but that Labour hadn\u2019t, including \u201cextending national insurance to employer pension contributions\u201d and \u201cincreasing employers\u2019 national insurance (the \u2018jobs tax\u2019)\u201d.</p> <p>This is the same Trott who, having told voters during the campaign that Labour\u2019s policy platform involved an implicit admission that employers\u2019 NICs would go up, is now saying Labour\u2019s promise in the campaign was the opposite.

Conventional wisdom (often citing George Bush, and his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_my_lips:_no_new_taxes\">\u201cRead my lips, no new taxes\u201d</a> pledge) says that it is fatal for politicians to break election promises.

David Cameron never came close to meeting his 2010 commitment to get net migration below 100,000, and that did not stop him being re-elected in 2015 (although it did help him lose the 2016 Brexit referendum). There were many reasons why Boris Johnson was forced out of office, but raising national insurance in breach of a 2019 manifesto promise is not usually seen as one of his career-ending mistakes.</p> <p>Nevertheless, breaking a promise is a huge risk, and that is why the very strong hints that Rachel Reeves will raiser employers\u2019 national insurance in the budget has opened up a key debate. As <strong>Richard Partington </strong>and<strong> Kiran Stacey</strong> report, Labour is arguing that its pledge not to raise national insurance only covered employees\u2019 national insurance, because the party repeatedly talked about taxes on working people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/14/rachel-reeves-hints-rise-in-employer-national-insurance-budget\">Reeves hints at rise in employer national insurance, as critics claim it breaches manifesto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Conservatives are saying people clearly took the promise to cover all national insurance. <strong>Laura Trott</strong>, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, issued this statement last night, after Reeves gave an interview clarifying her interpretation of the Labour pledge.

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has twice refused to rule out a rise in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions in the budget, stressing Labour\u2019s manifesto promise was that it would not raise taxes on working people. British employers have warned that a rise in employer national insurance contributions in the budget could hit hiring and limit pay rises, hurting businesses including pubs, hotels and restaurants. An undercover police officer has admitted that he spied on Keir Starmer while he was a radical barrister, a public inquiry has heard. The UK Foreign Office has announced sanctions against seven organisations that support illegal Israeli settlers in the West Bank, but held back from penalising two extremist members of the Israeli government as the former foreign secretary David Cameron had been planning. Boris Johnson\u2019s memoir, Unleashed, sold 42,528 copies in its opening week after being published on 10 October, making it the bestselling book of last week. Downing Street has rejected suggestions that Keir Starmer received Taylor Swift tickets as a \u201cthank you\u201d after she was given taxpayer-funded police security while performing in London. (See 1.29pm.) Democracy campaigners have argued that the government\u2019s House of Lords reform bill being debated today does not go far enough. In a joint statement, 10 democracy campaign groups have said that, although the bill getting rid of hereditary peers is a \u201claudable first step\u201d, the government should launch a consultation on wider Lords reform as soon as possible. They say: We\u2019re calling on the government to deliver on its manifesto promise of a proper consultation on the future of the Lords, including via a representative citizens\u2019 assembly, to let the people decide who should be holding politicians to account and making sure laws are sensible and fair. Continuing a system of political appointees risks accusations of cronyism and conflicts of interest. We need a second chamber that makes the most of the views and experience of a much more representative group. We call on the government to announce a timeline for the public consultation on wider Lords reform, and the means for doing it effectively, as soon as possible. We believe that a citizens\u2019 assembly as part of a national conversation would help ensure this public consultation would bring together people from all walks of life, to hear from experts, deliberate and make recommendations to be implemented by the government. The groups that have signed the statement, sent to the Guardian, are: the Democracy Network, Unlock Democracy, Involve, Citizen Network, Community Organisers, the Sortition Foundation, Independent Constitutionalists UK, 38 Degrees, Politics for the Many and Compass. In a separate move, almost 300,000 people have signed an online petition at Change.org saying the 26 Church of England bishops should be removed from the Lords. Oliver Dowden, the shadow deputy PM, told MPs that the Conservatives were opposing the bill removing hereditary peers from the House of Lords because they believed in being \u201ccautious about rushing into change\u201d. In his speech in the second reading debate, explaining why the opposition were against the bill (see 2.07pm), Dowden said: The checks and balances of the Lords \u2013 its tried and tested conventions \u2013 work. The Lords does not claim to be a democratic chamber, and that is the key point, this elected house has primacy. Now, of course, the British constitution does and should continue to evolve, but we should only fix what is broken and be cautious about rushing into change. Our evolution should start with questions of efficacy, not optics. Just as with the Blair and Brown governments before, this government seems obsessed with change for change\u2019s sake. We\u2019ve seen it all before, rebranding spun to give the impression of progress. He also accused Labour of being willing to tolerate MPs getting into the Commons on the basis of family links. Now, one of the central arguments evinced by the paymaster general [Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Labour minister opening the debate] is that no one in parliament should be there by, quote, \u2018an accident of birth\u2019. Yet today\u2019s Labour party reeks of the hereditary principle. The elevation of the nepo babies of north London, the coronation of the red princes\u2026 the Falconers, the Kinnocks, the Benns, the Eagles, the Reeves \u2013 many of them distinguished members, but under Labour\u2019s closed shop, it\u2019s hereditary peers out, hereditary MPs in. The Labour MPs Hamish Falconer, Stephen Kinnock and Hilary Benn are all the sons of former Labour cabinet ministers, while Angela and Maria Eagle, and Rachel and Ellie Reeves are sisters. They all became MPs by being selected in the normal way. Hereditary peers just inherit their titles when a parent, normally their father, dies. The ones who get into the House of Lords now do get elected in, by other peers, but only hereditary peers can stand, and so the competition is very limited. Dowden also said in his speech that he did not expect to remain in the shadow cabinet after the new Tory leader is elected. In his speech, Thomas-Symonds defended the bill. He said: In the 21st century there should not be places in our parliament, making our laws, reserved for those born into certain families. In fact, we are one of only two countries that still retain that hereditary element in our legislatures, a clear sign the time has come to see through this long overdue change. And it\u2019s a matter of principle for this government, committed to fairness and equality. The Foreign Office has announced sanctions against three illegal settler outposts and four organisations that have supported and sponsored violence against communities in the West Bank. Commenting on the announcement, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said: When I went to the West Bank earlier this year, on one of my first trips as foreign secretary, I met with Palestinians whose communities have suffered horrific violence at the hands of Israeli settlers. The inaction of the Israeli government has allowed an environment of impunity to flourish where settler violence has been allowed to increase unchecked. Settlers have shockingly even targeted schools and families with young children. Today\u2019s measures will help bring accountability to those who have supported and perpetrated such heinous abuses of human rights. Cleaners, porters and other workers in several government departments are to strike in a dispute over pay and conditions, PA Media reports. PA says: Members of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) will walk out for 14 days from 28 October. The workers, employed by ISS and G4S, voted overwhelmingly for strike action. The action will affect the Department for Business and Trade, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and the Cabinet Office, all in London. PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: \u201cThis escalation reflects the anger of our G4S and ISS members. They are particularly incensed by the insulting pay offers and the unacceptable fact that many receive no company sick pay.\u201d Rachel Reeves has been urged to abandon Labour\u2019s manifesto promise and raise national insurance for workers in the budget \u2013 by her former boss at the Bank of England, Mervyn King. In an article for the Independent, King says that it was \u201creckless\u201d for the Tories to cut national insurance before the general election, that both main parties were \u201cirresponsible\u201d when they said they would not reverse those cuts and that it would be best for the government to put it back up. King was governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013, and in his article he recalls a conversation with Reeves at the bank when she worked there in her first job after university. Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative chancellor, cut employees\u2019 national insurance from 12% to 10% in his autumn statement last year, and then he cut it again to 8% in his spring budget before the election. Taken together, the two cuts are worth around \u00a318bn in the current financial year. In his article, King says: Before the general election, both major parties were irresponsible in either making, or promising not to reverse, cuts in national insurance contributions. It was a reckless increase in the future national debt \u2013 an attempt to bribe voters with their children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s pocket money. An honest approach would be to say that such a commitment now appears a mistake and to return national insurance contributions to their previous level. You might be surprised by how many citizens would accept such honesty; better to tackle the problem now and not a year or so before the next general election. King also says that he accepts the case for higher government borrowing in the short term. If you believe that the UK requires higher investment to overcome the perception that \u201cnothing works any more\u201d \u2013 and I do not disagree \u2013 then you should argue for the merits of that \u2026 even if it means higher borrowing for a while. Reeves has signalled that in her budget she intends to keep the government\u2019s debt rule (that it should be falling in the fifth year of the forecast) but change the definition of debt used for this purpose. In his article, King says the rule itself should be changed. The current fiscal rule, that the ratio of debt to national income is projected to fall in the fifth year of the forecast horizon, makes little sense. It is Augustinian \u2013 make me fiscally stable\u2026 but not yet. But not even Saint Augustine believed in a five-year rolling horizon. The problem with the current rule is that it is too loose \u2013 not too tight (do read the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee report on debt published last month). Your challenge is to justify a temporary Augustinian deviation from the objective of a falling debt to national income ratio, because of the need to finance higher investment without cutting day-to-day public spending. Only a convincing and credible strategy for raising investment while achieving fiscal sustainability by the end of this parliament will help to reduce the upward pressure on long-term interest rates, resulting from higher borrowing. King ends his article by calling a conversation with Reeves at the bank. I remember your telling me one day that the reason you enjoyed working at the Bank of England was the opportunity to work with other very bright young people. Your generation is now in charge. Be courageous, be bold, and ensure that the economic inheritance we leave to our grandchildren is one of which both they and we can be proud. One day, you will look back on your time as chancellor and you will want to remember the far-reaching changes you made \u2013 not the political compromises that others will urge on you. Reeves may appreciate King\u2019s advice, but she has repeatedly made it clear that she won\u2019t abandon Labour\u2019s pledge not to put up employees\u2019 national insurance. Politicians who have to face the electorate tend to take manifesto promises more seriously than unelected officials like King. Anneliese Dodds, the development minister, told MPs this afternoon that the situation in Gaza is \u201ctruly intolerable\u201d. In response to a Commons urgent question on Lebanon and Gaza, she said: The situation in Lebanon is worsening by the day. Civilian casualties are mounting and more than a quarter of the Lebanese population has been displaced. On the subject of humanitarian needs in Lebanon, I announced \u00a310m of support to Lebanon to respond to the widespread lack of shelter and reduced access to water, hygiene and healthcare. This is in addition to the \u00a35m we\u2019ve already provided to Unicef. It\u2019s clear that a political solution consistent with [UN security council] resolution 1701 is the only way to restore the sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability of Lebanon. This requires an immediate ceasefire between Lebanese Hezbollah and Israel now, and immediate negotiations to re-establish security and stability for the people living on either side of the Israeli-Lebanon border. While the world turns its attention to Lebanon, we must not forget the situation for the people of Gaza. They are in a truly intolerable situation currently and winter will make them increasingly vulnerable, including to communicable disease. All of Gaza\u2019s population now faces the risk of famine. Access to basic services, safe drinking water, shelter, healthcare, is becoming harder by the day. We are gravely concerned by the situation in northern Gaza in particular \u2013 very little aid has entered northern Gaza since October 1. The UQ was tabled by the Labour MP Andy McDonald who said that repeated calls on Israel to uphold their humanitarian obligations were having \u201cno impact\u201d and that \u201crecognition of Palestine is a pre-requisite for peace and not a by-product of it\u201d. As Jessica Elgot reports, the Labour MP Josh MacAlister is introducing a private member\u2019s bill designed to limit the extent to which under-16s can access addictive social media content on their phones. The bill has various components, and one of them would require schools in England to be mobile phone free zones. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesperson indicated that the government would not back this aspect of the bill. He said: Headteachers already have the power to ban phones in school and many have chosen to exercise this right. So we don\u2019t have plans to legislate in that particular area. Asked if the government thought the current law on schools and phones was adequate, the spokesperson said: That is the government\u2019s position on the question of banning phones in schools. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, told cabinet colleagues this morning that the government could not \u201cturn around 14 years of decline in one year or one budget\u201d. With the budget taking place two weeks tomorrow, Keir Starmer held a political cabinet this morning (a cabinet for party political discussion, not debate on government business), and the Labour party has sent out a readout saying Reeves had a difficult message for her follow ministers. A Labour spokesperson said: The prime minister said that the first Labour budget in 14 years would prioritise stabilising the economy, fixing the foundations, and growing our way to a better Britain. He added that prioritising growth is vital to break the country out of the low growth, high tax doom loop it has been stuck in for the past 14 years. The chancellor updated the cabinet on preparations for the budget and the spending review, which she said is an opportunity to put the country on a firmer footing. The chancellor highlighted the \u00a322bn black hole inheritance from the previous government that needed to be filled just to keep public services standing still. The chancellor said that the scale of inheritance meant there would have to be difficult decisions on spending, welfare, and tax \u2013 and that the long-term priority had to be unlocking private sector investment to drive economic growth. The chancellor told cabinet the budget would focus on putting the public finances on a strong footing and being honest with the British people about the scale of the challenge. The chancellor said the government could not turn around 14 years of decline in one year or one budget. However, the budget would deliver on the government\u2019s priorities to protect working people, fix the NHS, and rebuild Britain. In the Commons MPs have just started debating the second reading of the House of Lords (hereditary peers) bill \u2013 the legislation removing the right of the remaining hereditary peers to stay in the Lords. The Conservatives are going to vote against. They have set out their reasons is an amendment that says: That this house declines to give a second reading to the House of Lords (hereditary peers) bill because it is not an acceptable or effective method of enacting major constitutional change, because it proposes a significant alteration to the composition of the House of Lords which should not be considered in isolation from other changes, having regard to the undertakings given by the then government in 1999, because it drip-feeds changes that hinder proper scrutiny of measures that could change the relationship between the two houses, because it risks unintended consequences, does not reflect the lack of political consensus on House of Lords reform and does not provide for full consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny which would give the opportunity to consider the case for overall reform, seek cross-party engagement on proposals, and review the implications of all proposals. The SNP has also tabled an amendment saying the bill should not be passed because it would be better to abolish the House of Lords altogether but, unlike the Tory amendment, this one will not be put to a vote today. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has indicated the government will regularly update the data document published alongside the Darzi review into the state of the NHS, Rosie Anfilogoff reports. She writes: In a report released last month, Lord Darzi, a leading surgeon and former Labour health minister, provided an assessment of the state of the health service, saying it was in a dire state. The report bolsters Streeting\u2019s argument that the last Conservative goverment allowed the NHS to decline, and that reform is now needed. Alongside the main 163-page report, Darzi published a technical annex, twice as long, containing more than 330 charts and tables, covering areas from mental health outcomes to life expectancy. Speaking during health questions in the Commons, Layla Moran, the Lib Dem chair of the health committee, stressed the importance of the data, saying \u201cwhat we measure is so often what we end up improving,\u201d and called on Streeting to keep the \u201cincredibly useful\u201d baseline updated yearly. Streeting welcomed Moran\u2019s request, calling it a \u201cgreat constructive challenge\u201d and reiterating the Labour government\u2019s commitment to transparency. He went on: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get everything right, and sometimes we\u2019re not going to make progress as fast as we\u2019d like, but where that\u2019s the case we\u2019re never going to duck that, we\u2019re never going to pretend things are better than they are, because the reason why we will succeed, where the previous government has failed, is we\u2019re willing to face up to the challenges in the NHS, rather than pretend they don\u2019t exist.\u201d Downing Street has rejected suggestions that Keir Starmer received Taylor Swift tickets as a \u201cthank you\u201d after she was given taxpayer-funded police security while performing in London, PA Media reports. PA says: No 10 would not say whether the prime minister was confident that perceptions of a conflict of interest had been avoided but insisted \u201coperational decisions\u201d were \u201cultimately\u201d up to Scotland Yard and not the government. Last week it emerged that London mayor Sadiq Khan and home secretary Yvette Cooper were involved in talks around the security for Swift\u2019s sell-out summer shows at Wembley before the singer was granted a blue-light escort. The Sun reported that she was given the motorbike convoy on the way to the stadium despite initial police reservations, with her mother Andrea Swift also negotiating arrangements directly with No 10 aide Sue Gray. Asked today whether it was the prime minister\u2019s view that there was no perception of a conflict of interest, his official spokesperson said: \u201cOperational decisions are for the Met. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d Downing Street cited the terror threat faced by Swift in Vienna, which had forced her to cancel gigs on the Austria leg of her Eras tour, as one of the reasons government was involved in security talks round her London shows. Senior Labour politicians including the prime minister and Cooper have accepted free tickets to the singer\u2019s concerts, which came under intense scrutiny in recent weeks amid a row over freebies given to ministers. The PM announced he would cover the cost of around \u00a36,000 worth of gifts and hospitality he received received since entering office following the donations backlash, as well as committing to changing ministerial hospitality to improve transparency. Among the declarations he paid back were four tickets to see Swift at Wembley Stadium which were received on 20 August from UMG, the musician\u2019s record label. Asked whether No 10 could rule out Starmer having been given the tickets as a \u201cthank you\u201d after discussions between government and the force were followed by Swift getting security while in London, the spokesperson said: \u201cI completely reject that characterisation because it\u2019s ultimately up to the police to take operational decisions in relation to the security of these major events.\u201d A Met Police spokesperson said: \u201cThe Met is operationally independent. Our decision-making is based on a thorough assessment of threat, risk and harm and the circumstances of each case. It is our longstanding position that we don\u2019t comment on the specific details of protective security arrangements.\u201d At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesperson declined to say whether the government is considering sanctioning two Israeli ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir. In an interview with the Today programme, David Cameron, the former foreign secretary, said the last government was considering sanctioning them because of their support for extremist settlers in the West Bank and their oppostion to aid convoys going into Gaza. Asked if the new government is also considering sanctioning the two ministers, the spokesperson said: As you would appreciate, I can\u2019t get into any commentary around future sanctions designations. As you know, the UK has already sanctioned a number of people responsible for settler violence in the West Bank and we will obviously continue to take action to challenge those who undermine a two-state solution. Military veterans will be able to use their veteran card as photographic ID when they vote, the government has announced. The previous government introduced the veteran card, to enable veterans to show that they qualify for services and benefits offered to veterans, but there was criticism of the fact that it was not included in the list of photographic ID documents that prove someone is entitled to vote under another law introduced by the Tories. Alex Norris, the minister for elections, has said that secondary legislation will be used to ensure that in future the veteran card will be acceptable ID. The change will be in force in time for the local elections in May next year. A wider review of the photo ID rules is also underway. Critics claim that they are skewed in favour of older people (because of the cards deemed acceptable), unnecessary (because electoral fraud of this kind is rare anyway) and political motivated (because of claims they were introduced to reduce the chances of younger, left-inclined people voting). In a news release, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: This government is also making our democracy stronger than it has ever been and the addition of the veteran card is only the first step in delivering on our commitments to encourage participation in our elections. Keir Starmer spoke to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian PM, last night about the Canadian investigation into allegations that the Indian government has been working with gangsters to kill dissidents in Canada. In a readout of the call released this morning, Downing Street said: The prime minister spoke to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau yesterday evening. They discussed recent developments regarding allegations under investigation in Canada. Both agreed on the importance of the rule of law. They agreed to remain in close contact pending the conclusions of the investigation. The issue is likely to come up again at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM) in Samoa next week. The Liberal Democrats are urging the government to rule out raising employers\u2019 national insurance. In a statement issued after Keir Starmer\u2019s interview this morning, Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, said: The chancellor needs to think again if the government is considering hiking taxes on small businesses, who have already suffered from eye-watering tax rises under the last Conservative government. The burden of this budget should fall on the likes of big banks, social media giants and oil and gas firms, instead of our local community businesses. The chancellor should be protecting these smaller businesses, who are the backbone of our economy and the heartbeat of our communities. Now is not the time to raise national insurance rates on our high streets, local businesses and dynamic entrepreneurs. The government is facing an extra \u00a3100m bill for next year\u2019s state pension increases following revised official figures published on Tuesday, Steve Webb, a former Lib Dem pensions minister, has said. PA Media says: Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension increases every April in line with whichever is the highest of earnings growth in the year from May to July of the previous year, CPI (consumer prices index) inflation in September of the previous year, or 2.5%. With inflation running at more subdued levels, it is thought that wages will determine next year\u2019s state pension increase. Last month, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures indicated that total pay had increased by 4.0% annually in the three months to July. But when jobs data was released on Tuesday, the ONS had revised the figure up to 4.1%. Webb said the additional 0.1 percentage point could add around \u00a3100m to the state pension bill under the triple lock formula. Webb, who is now a partner at consultants LCP (Lane Clark &amp; Peacock), explained: A slightly higher rate of increase is welcome for pensioners, though will be an unwelcome \u00a3100m extra cost for the chancellor as she prepares her budget. The rate of the new state pension will now be close to \u00a312,000 per year, very near to the \u00a312,570 tax-free personal allowance. This is likely to put extra pressure on the chancellor to take action on tax allowances in the coming years. The Conservatives are claiming that a comment by Rachel Reeves from 2021 justifies their claim that raising employers\u2019 national insurance would be a breach of Labour\u2019s 2024 manifesto promise. In a fresh statement released by CCHQ this morning after Keir Starmer\u2019s interview, Laura Trott, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: In 2021, the chancellor said increasing employer national insurance was a tax on \u2018workers\u2019. That\u2019s why even in her own words it breaks Labour\u2019s manifesto promise not to increase tax on working people. In a Commons debate on 19 October 2021, Reeves said: Despite all their election promises to cut national insurance contributions, [the Conservatives] are actually raising them against the strong advice of businesses and trade unions. The Conservative government\u2019s actions will make each new recruit more expensive and increase the costs to business. The decision to saddle employers and workers with the jobs tax takes money out of people\u2019s pockets when our economic recovery is not yet established or secure and only adds to the pressure on businesses after a testing year and a half. When all other costs are going up\u2014the costs of energy and of supplies\u2014these tax rises are only hitting them harder. As mentioned earlier, during the election Trott criticised Labour explicitly for not ruling out raising employers\u2019 national insurance. (See 9.28am.) David Cameron has rejected the suggestion that the Tory leadership contest shows that his party modernisation project has been abandoned. When Cameron became party leader in 2005, he was younger than other candidates, and past leaders, and he deliberately sought to modernise the Tories. Partly this was about changing its culture, but partly it was about adopting policies that appeared more \u201ccentrist\u201d. But now the two candidates left in the Tory leadership contest, Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick, are well to the right of Cameron. Unlike Cameron, they are both now pro-Brexit and anti-immigration, and neither of them has been very positive about his record in government. But, in an interview on the Today programme, when it was put to him by Nick Robinson that his showed the Cameron modernisation projected had been \u201cbinned\u201d, Cameron replied: \u201cNot at all.\u201d He went on: When you look at the makeup of the candidates that were running for the leadership, the idea that there would be British black and minority ethnic candidates running for the leadership of the party, having just had Britain\u2019s first British Indian prime minister, would have been unthinkable when I became leader of the party in 2005. So the change in the makeup of the party, quite apart from anything else, has definitely endured. One of Cameron\u2019s priorities as Tory leader was getting a more diverse group of candidates elected. When it was put to him that the politics of the leadership candidates were very different to his, Cameron said he did not agree. He said it was important for the candidates to debate issues. They would have \u201cgood days and bad days\u201d, he said. He said he would \u201cstay out of\u201d the contest, but support the winner. David Cameron has claimed that he does not recall telling Boris Johnson he would fuck him up for ever if he backed leave in the 2016 referendum campaign. Johnson makes the claim in his recently-published memoir, where he recalls telling Cameron that he was thinking of backing leave. Johnson writes: \u2018If you do that,\u2019 [Cameron] said \u2013 and these were his exact words \u2013 \u2018I will fuck you up for ever.\u2019 Johnson implies the threat carried some weight (although not enought to make him change his mind). In his memoir he goes on: I had to admit that the threat sounded serious. Did I want to be fucked up? For ever? By a prime minister equipped with all the fucking-up tools available to a modern government, and thousands of fucker-uppers just waiting to do his bidding? In an interview with Times Radio this morning, asked about Johnson\u2019s account, Cameron replied: I find that hard to believe. What I do remember saying is, Boris, you\u2019ve never backed Britain leaving the EU before, you\u2019ve always said, let\u2019s reform it, let\u2019s change it. I said, why back it now when we got a better deal? You might not like my deal. You might think you can do better when you become prime minister, as you probably will in a few years time. But don\u2019t suddenly back something you\u2019ve never backed before. That was the argument I remember having. And I don\u2019t remember any language any fruitier than that. But you know, memories, recollections differ, as they say. Cameron also said it was \u201ca spirited conversation\u201d. This is a classic non-denial denial. And, in fact, it is not even hard to believe that Cameron did threaten Johnson like this using the f-word. Although mostly genial in public, as PM Cameron was well known for having a temper, and his command of Anglo-Saxon was impressive. Keir Starmer has has welcomed private investment of \u00a3550m to make it easier for people to find a home, PA Media reports. PA says: Schroders, Man Group and Resonance announced new impact investment funds on Tuesday \u2013 pots of money that aim to create social or environmental impact. These will help to address directly the shortage of homes by supporting the building of tens of thousands of new homes across the UK, the Treasury said. Speaking on BBC Breakfast this morning, Starmer said: We\u2019ve said as a government we\u2019re going to fix the foundations, rebuild our country, and expressly saying \u2018now is the time to back us\u2019. Companies and investors are coming in today saying \u2018here\u2019s half a billion pounds\u2019. We want to raise that, by the way, I want that to be up over \u00a31bn before too long. David Cameron, the former prime minister and former foreign secretary, has revealed he had been planning to impose sanctions on two extremist members of the Israeli government over their support for violent settlers and calls to block aid entering Gaza, Patrick Wintour reports. The Conservatives say raising employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs) would break a Labour manifesto promise. (See 8.24am.) Keir Starmer says it wouldn\u2019t. (See 9.12am.) Who\u2019s right? Starmer says Labour\u2019s manifesto was \u201cvery clear\u201d. It says: Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase national insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT. This is not \u201cvery clear\u201d about the distinction between employees\u2019 NICs and employers\u2019. If anything, it is the opposite \u2013 intentionally ambiguous. But, during the election campaign, the Tories repeatedly challenged Labour politicians to explicity rule out increasing employers\u2019 NICs \u2013 and Labour shadow ministers repeatedly refused to give that commitment. Instead, they just stuck to the wording in the manifesto. As a result, CCHQ repeatedly put out press releases during the campaign asserting as fact that Labour did intend to raise various taxes, including employers\u2019 national insurance. For example, on 14 June it released one with the heading \u201cLabour\u2019s 18 tax rises\u201d that started: Laura Trott, chief secretary to the Treasury, has laid out a raft of new taxes Britain will face under a Labour government. Trott outlined the 18 new tax rises Labour will hit the country with - everything from your home to your car and from your work to your pension. The press released then listed 18 tax rises that it said the Tories had ruled out but that Labour hadn\u2019t, including \u201cextending national insurance to employer pension contributions\u201d and \u201cincreasing employers\u2019 national insurance (the \u2018jobs tax\u2019)\u201d. This is the same Trott who, having told voters during the campaign that Labour\u2019s policy platform involved an implicit admission that employers\u2019 NICs would go up, is now saying Labour\u2019s promise in the campaign was the opposite. (See 8.24am.) The Conservatives are being opportunist and inconsistent. UPDATE: At a press conference during the election campaign Trott also made a point of specifically highlighting Labour\u2019s decision not to rule out raising employers\u2019 national insurance. She said: [Labour] also matched us on on income tax, and not raising employee national insurance. But that is where they have very conspicuously stopped. We openly challenge Labour to match the other tax guarantees in our manifesto. Their response? Silence. This is what Keir Starmer said when Henry Zeffman asked him if Labour\u2019s manifesto ruled out increasing any rate of national insurance, or if it was just ruling out increasing the employees\u2019 rate. Starmer replied: We were very clear the manifesto that we wouldn\u2019t be increasing tax on working people. We expressly said that that was income tax, that was NICs [national insurance contributions] etc, so we set that out in the manifesto. Asked again if it was saying NICs just for employees, Starmer went on: It was very clear from our manifesto that what we were saying is we\u2019re not to raise tax for working people. It wasn\u2019t just the manifesto. We said it repeatedly in the campaign, and we intend to keep the promises that we made in our manifesto. So I\u2019m not going to reveal to you the details of the budget. You know that that\u2019s not possible at this stage. What I will say is where we made promises in our manifesto we\u2019ll will be keeping those promises. This is going to be a budget that\u2019s going to be tough, of course, but the focus will be on rebuilding our country and ensuring that we get the growth needed in economy. Q: You are giving an interview out in the street. Is that a recognition that in first 100 days you did not communicate effectively enough? Starmer says he is getting on with delivering the change that is needed, and that the investment summit delivered investment worth \u00a363bn. And that is the end of the interview. It wasn\u2019t very revealing, but at least it provided fresh words (if not fresh insight) on the national insurance controversy. Q: Did the manifesto rule out increasing any rate of national insurance? Or was it just employees\u2019 national insurance? Starmer claims it was \u201cvery clear\u201d in the manifesto that Labour would not raise taxes on working people. He says Labour will be keeping those promises. But he says he will not discuss what is in the budget. This is consistent with that Rachel Reeves said yesterday about employers\u2019 national insurance not being covered, although Reeves was more explicit. Q: Do you agree with the health secretary that weight loss drugs could play a big role in addressing worklessness? Starmer says he thinks these drugs could make a difference. Q: What can you tell viewers about how their lives will improve? Starmer says he wants to ensure investment benefits all parts of the country. Keir Starmer is being interviews on BBC Breakfast now by Henry Zeffman, the BBC\u2019s chief political correspondent. Q: You are talking about a social homes investment. But the country needs 1.5 million homes. Starmer says the investment summit yesterday was important. Investors are now saying they want to back the country. Young people know that owning their own home is the \u201cbase camp\u201d for aspirations in life. The government wants to let them do this, he says. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has said that he thinks raising employers\u2019 national insurance would be a breach of Labour\u2019s manifesto. He told Times Radio recently: It seems to me that would be a straightforward breach of a manifesto commitment. I went back and read the manifesto and it says very clearly we will not raise rates of national insurance. It doesn\u2019t specify employee national insurance. Politicians are often happy to ignore the IFS. But it is seen as the nearest the country has got to a neutral \u201cumpire\u201d on budget matters. Good morning. Conventional wisdom (often citing George Bush, and his \u201cRead my lips, no new taxes\u201d pledge) says that it is fatal for politicians to break election promises. In reality, that is not always the case. David Cameron never came close to meeting his 2010 commitment to get net migration below 100,000, and that did not stop him being re-elected in 2015 (although it did help him lose the 2016 Brexit referendum). There were many reasons why Boris Johnson was forced out of office, but raising national insurance in breach of a 2019 manifesto promise is not usually seen as one of his career-ending mistakes. Nevertheless, breaking a promise is a huge risk, and that is why the very strong hints that Rachel Reeves will raiser employers\u2019 national insurance in the budget has opened up a key debate. As Richard Partington and Kiran Stacey report, Labour is arguing that its pledge not to raise national insurance only covered employees\u2019 national insurance, because the party repeatedly talked about taxes on working people. But the Conservatives are saying people clearly took the promise to cover all national insurance. Laura Trott, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, issued this statement last night, after Reeves gave an interview clarifying her interpretation of the Labour pledge. Trott said: The chancellor has chosen Labour\u2019s first investment summit to sow further uncertainty and chaos for businesses who are now braced for Labour\u2019s Jobs Tax. Regardless of what they say, it\u2019s obvious to all that hiking employer national insurance is a clear breach of Labour\u2019s manifesto. Rachel Reeves herself previously called it anti-business and we agree, it is a tax on work that will deter investment, employment and growth, and the OBR says it will lower wages. Keir Starmer is giving an interview to BBC Breakfast at 8.30am, so we are likely to hear his take then. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Keir Starmer chairs a meeting of political cabinet. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: Wes Streeting, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 12.30pm: MPs debate the second reading of the House of Lords (hereditary peers) bill, which will remove the right of remaining hereditary peers to sit in the Lords. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I\u2019m still using X and I\u2019ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian). I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct). And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

      "bodyText": "An undercover police officer has admitted that he spied on Keir Starmer while he was a barrister, a public inquiry has heard. The police spy has said that he accessed confidential details of the legal advice that Starmer was giving to two environmentalist campaigners in the well-known McLibel case in the early 1990s. The contents of the advice were then relayed by the spy to his managers in a covert Scotland Yard unit, the inquiry was told on Tuesday. At the time, the prime minister was building a reputation as a civil liberties barrister championing causes as diverse as striking trade unionists to prisoners who had been sentenced to death around the world. One of the cases concerned a pair of environmental campaigners, Helen Steel and Dave Morris, who \u2013 in a David v Goliath case \u2013 were sued for libel by McDonald\u2019s over a leaflet they had distributed criticising the company\u2019s practices. Confronted with the legal might of the US fast food giant, the pair turned to Starmer who gave them free advice on how to defend themselves. The impecunious pair could not afford lawyers to represent them in what turned out to be the longest civil trial in English history. The advice Starmer provided for the McLibel two has played an important part in his life and his subsequent political career. It was cited in his leadership bid in 2020, with his campaign launch video describing how \u201cfor 10 years he defended Helen Steel and David Morris when they were sued for libel by McDonald\u2019s. They fought all the way and won.\u201d Now the covert monitoring of the McLibel pair, including Starmer\u2019s legal help, will be scrutinised in the coming months at the inquiry. It will also hear allegations that Starmer\u2019s legal advice was shared with McDonald\u2019s to help the corporation win the case. The public inquiry is examining how police deployed about 139 undercover officers to spy on more than 1,000 political groups between 1968 and at least 2010. One was John Dines who infiltrated anarchist and environmental groups between 1987 and 1991. During his deployment, he formed a two-year intimate relationship with Steel, but concealed from her the fact that he was employed by the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), a covert Scotland Yard unit, to spy on her and her circle of campaigners. She eventually pieced together disparate clues to expose him after he disappeared without a trace. On Tuesday, Morris gave evidence to the inquiry in which he quoted from a witness statement that has been made by Dines. He quoted Dines as saying : \u201cIt is accurate to say that I was by the side of Helen Steel and Dave Morris in 1991 and relaying the legal advice back to my bosses in the SDS.\u201d Morris said that the only lawyer giving them legal advice at that time was Starmer. Dines\u2019s witness statement will be published at a later date by the inquiry. Morris told the inquiry: \u201cDines was getting details of our confidential legal advice and strategy following the private legal meetings Helen and I held with lawyer Keir Starmer.\u201d He said this was a clear breach of the longstanding legal rule that lawyers and their clients can debate tactics within a protected ring of confidentiality. Morris said he discussed Starmer\u2019s advice and the legal case when he visited Steel who was at that time living with Dines. He cited evidence showing that the police secretly passed information about the campaigners to McDonald\u2019s. He alleged the police secretly shared Starmer\u2019s confidential legal advice and other information with McDonald\u2019s which gave the corporation an advantage in the legal battle. Those who have worked with Starmer say his time as director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013 knocked some of the leftwing campaigning zeal out of him. One former colleague told the Guardian last year: \u201cWhen he was very young would say he was extremely leftwing \u2026 he had all those leftwing shibboleths, which he has reconsidered since he became a public servant.\u201d The McLibel case was widely seen as a public relations disaster for McDonald\u2019s. It exposed damaging stories about its business and the quality of food it was selling. It was also seen as a heavy-handed way of stifling criticism. In 1997, a high court judge ordered Steel and Morris to pay \u00a360,000 in damages for libelling the corporation in what was a partial victory for McDonald\u2019s. But the pair never paid.

      "body": "<p>Robert Coover, who has died aged 92, was one of the pioneers of postmodern writing as it developed in the US in the 1960s, alongside writers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/thomaspynchon\">Thomas Pynchon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/12/john-barth-obituary\">John Barth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-john-hawkes-1162597.html\">John Hawkes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/apr/01/donald-barthelme-short-story\">Donald Barthelme</a>. This was before postmodernism acquired its current political and structural connotations, a time Hari Kunzru described, in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jun/27/robert-coover-life-in-writing\">2011 Guardian profile of Coover</a>, as a \u201cfantastical funhouse of narrative possibilities\u201d. </p> <p>Coover recounted his frustration with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/07/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Saul Bellow</a>\u2019s 1953 novel The Adventures of Augie March, and what was called realism. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t realistic. He was using modes of response to the world that had become stultified.\u201d He later explained: \u201cI learned my realism from guys like Franz Kafka.\u201d</p>    <p>Despite success with his early novels, his shorter work was more defining, in particular his 1969 collection Pricksongs and Descants (the title refers to how, in manuscripts of medieval European music, the notes were physically \u201cpricked\u201d or marked with dots). It became a crucial work of postmodern fiction, particularly The Babysitter, whose free-standing paragraphs challenged the nature of story-telling. </p> <p>It began with a teenage girl\u2019s minding of three children and escalated into a series of lascivious, sometimes contradictory, vignettes involving violent boyfriends and parental fantasies. The seemingly random order of the narrative was reminiscent of Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Hopscotch or William Burroughs\u2019s Naked Lunch. As Barth wrote: \u201cThe process is the content, more or less.\u201d</p> <p>Improbably, The Babysitter became a 1995 Hollywood film starring Alicia Silverstone; the result, closer to a Jamie Lee Curtis horror film emphasising the salacious, was itself worthy of another Coover fiction. </p> <p>HIs biggest, and most controversial, popular success was his third novel, The Public Burning (1977), a reimagining of the trial and execution of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1953/jun/20/usa.fromthearchive\">Julius and Ethel Rosenberg</a> for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. </p> <p>A blovatious, cartoon-like Uncle Sam battles the villainous Phantom, in chapters alternating with Richard Nixon\u2019s schemes to stage the execution in Times Square. It reached the bestseller lists, but the publisher worried about libel suits, and let it go out of print.</p> <p>This was a long way from Coover\u2019s first novel, The Origins of the Brunists (1966), a sprawling tale about a cult built around the sole survivor of a mining disaster. It won the Pen/Faulkner award, and harked back, like Pynchon\u2019s V (which also won the Faulkner) or Barth\u2019s Sot Weed Factor, to the playful narratives of 18th-century novelists such as Henry Fielding or Laurence Sterne. </p> <p>But it did not prepare readers for his second novel, The Universal Baseball Association, Inc, J. Henry Waugh, Prop. (1968) in which the titular lonely accountant creates a baseball simulation game, rolling three 10-sided dice and using the 1/1,000 probabilities to recapitulate imaginary players\u2019 action in games. When three rolls demand a shocking event involving his favourite created player, his world collapses. Tightly written and set in a controlled, though random, environment, the novel became a cult classic.</p> <p>Coover\u2019s background was midwestern traditional. Born in Charles City, Iowa, he was the son of Maxine (nee Sweet), a doctor\u2019s assistant, and Grant, a newspaper editor. The family moved frequently, and Robert edited school papers both in high school and college. </p> <p>He transferred from Southern Illinois University to Indiana University, graduating in 1953 with a BA in Slavic studies. He then joined the US Navy as a lieutenant, serving mostly in Europe; there were later suggestions he was in intelligence. </p>    <p>Discharged in 1957, he spent time writing in a cabin in Canada. In 1959 he married Maria del Pilar Sans, a Catalan needlepoint artist whom he had met in Spain. </p> <p>He received an MA in humanities from the University of Chicago in 1965, and began teaching at Bard College; he would teach at five other universities and spend three years as fiction editor of the Iowa Review before Hawkes brought him to Brown University, in Rhode Island, in 1981, where he stayed until 2012. His students included many successful writers, among them Jeffrey Eugenides, Jim Shepard, Sam Lipsyte and Joanna Scott.</p> <p>In 1968, Coover joined in the protests against the Vietnam war. With Nixon running for president, he also wrote a novella, The Cat in the Hat for President, which his publisher rejected because Dr Seuss was their bestselling author. </p> <p>But Coover\u2019s editor passed the manuscript to the New American Review, who published it; it eventually appeared as a book in 1980 retitled A Political Fable. He revisited Nixon one more time, in Whatever Happened to Gloomy Gus of the Chicago Bears (1987), where Nixon\u2019s devotion to football as a college bench-warmer is transformed into a tale of obsession. Coover claimed Pynchon\u2019s V had convinced him of the importance of humour; \u201call my work is basically comic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Coover was also a football fan, of FC Barcelona (his wife\u2019s influence) and Queen\u2019s Park Rangers, a loyalty picked up in the 70s while in Britain on a fellowship. There he bonded with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1992/feb/17/fiction.angelacarter\">Angela Carter</a>, as can be seen in his reworking of fairy tales in the novellas Briar Rose (1996) and Pinocchio in Venice (1991). In his introduction to Briar Rose, John Banville wrote: \u201cCoover is a magician and these are his spells.\u201d</p> <p>Briar Rose was published alongside Coover\u2019s novella aping Victorian sadomasochism, Spanking the Maid (1982). He found genre fiction, including pornography, \u201cthough conservative in form\u201d, more useful for a writer trying to \u201cburrow inside the collective psyche\u201d. Gerald\u2019s Party (1996), an outgrowth of The Babysitter, spiced up the classic mystery, while Noir (2010) features a detective called Phil M Noir.</p> <p>Coover was fascinated by the paradox of writing being a two-dimensional exercise in a three-dimensional world. At Brown, he helped found the Electronic Literature Organisation to explore the digital medium. His works were often described as \u201cmetafictions\u201d, but he began teaching students the art of \u201ccave-writing\u201d, the cave being an immersive 3D space in which they could produce \u201chyperfictions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I saw quite clearly in the 80s, before the internet, was that the whole world was shifting to digital formats,\u201d he wrote in a 1992 essay The End of Books. </p> <p>Nevertheless, he continued writing: his later work included a 1,000-page sequel to his first novel, The Brunist Day of Wrath (2014) and Huck Out West (2017), a follow-up to Huckleberry Finn. </p> <p>He admired graphic novels such as Alan Moore\u2019s Watchmen, and his 2021 story Street Cop was illustrated by Art Spiegleman. He leaves more than 30 uncollected short stories, many of which were published in New Yorker magazine. </p> <p>When asked who he would like to write his life story, Coover replied: \u201cSamuel Beckett. It would be funny and mercifully short.\u201d </p> <p>Maria survives him, as do their daughters, Sara and Diana, and a son Roderick.</p> <p>\u2022 Robert Lowell Coover, writer, born 4 February 1932; died 5 October 2024</p>",

The Euclid mission, launched in 2023 and run by the European Space Agency (Esa) with contributions from Nasa, sent its first snapshots in November of that year and in May 2024. The goal of Euclid is to enable the creation of a 3D map in time and space of the universe, in an attempt to elucidate its evolution and, as a result, shed light on the mysterious phenomena of dark energy and dark matter that together make up 95% of the universe. The newly released data is a mosaic of 208 gigapixels and covers 1% of what will be the final map. The completed map is expected to involve six years of observations and will take in a third of the sky, with observations expected to capture billions of galaxies out to 10bn light years. Prof Mat Page, of the Mullard space science laboratory at University College London (UCL), who is the lead for Euclid\u2019s VIS (visible instrument) camera, said that before Euclid no one had ever made an image of such a large area of sky at such high resolution. \u201cEven the zoomed-in images don\u2019t show the full resolution of Euclid\u2019s spectacular VIS camera,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore Euclid, we would never be able to see the faint cirrus clouds in the Milky Way, and pick out every star that\u2019s illuminating them in super-high resolution. \u201cAnd this is just a tiny fraction of the full area that Euclid is going to survey, so by the end we\u2019ll have a real astronomical harvest of discoveries.\u201d Images released by Esa highlight the area of the sky covered by the new mosaic, together with the mosaic itself and zoomed-in views within it. Esa said regions of light blue that can be seen in the mosaic were galactic cirrus clouds that sit between stars in the Milky Way. These wispy clouds, composed of gas and dust, reflect optical light, allowing them to be captured by the mission\u2019s super-sensitive visible light camera. Zoom in on the mosaic further and other features can be seen, including the spiral galaxy NGC 2188 and the galaxy cluster Abell 3381. In a view zoomed in 600 times relative to the original mosaic, a distant swirling galaxy is visible in incredible detail.",

stability and growth</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The global economy is a volatile place and politicians trying to cope with the ups and downs should be cut some slack, the International Monetary Fund appears to be saying in its latest message ahead of the Washington-based organisation\u2019s annual meetings next week.</strong></p> <p>Uncertainty about where the global economy is going has been higher since the Covid-19 pandemic and the inflation shocks that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the IMF says in an advanced chapter of its Global Financial Stability Review, just released.</p> <p>Rising tensions from the ongoing situation in Ukraine and the middle east conflict are only adding to the difficulties for all governments of making economic and social policies that give a degree of certainty to households and businesses.</p> <p>Uncertainty, says the IMF, is a growth killer. The lender of last resort says it has evidence from the 2008 banking crash, when the lack of certainty reduced GDP growth a year ahead by 1.2 percentage points on average in advanced and emerging market economies.</p> <p>The uncertainy also persuades central banks to keep interest rates higher than they would otherwise do, crippling with higher interest bills those businesses and governments that have allowed their debts to pile up in the good times, when interest rates were low.</p> <p>However, politicians are not entirely off the hook. The IMF says governments should avoid the temptation to loosen regulations that allow for reckless borowing to boost growth. It said politicians should maintain and enhance regulations limiting the risks that banks and other financial services can take.</p> <p>Governments should also \u201cbuild adequate international reserve buffers and allow exchange rate flexibility to help cushion the adverse spillover effects of an increase in foreign macroeconomic uncertainty\u201d, the Fund says.</p> <p>This is a message to Beijing and Washington to resist promoting a strong currency as a policy goal when that can distort global financial markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1846219484664942838\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Higher economic uncertainty raises the risks to financial stability.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up\u2026 here are today\u2019s main stories: British employers have warned that a rise in employer national insurance contributions in the budget could hit hiring and limit pay rises, hurting businesses including pubs, hotels and restaurants. Keir Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have refused to rule out a rise in employer contributions in the budget on 30 October, as part of plans to plug what the government says is a \u00a322bn hole in the public finances left by the previous Conservative government. The head of UK Hospitality, which represents bars, pubs, restaurants and hotels, said such a move would be a tax on jobs. \u201cAn increase would particularly hammer sectors like hospitality, where staffing costs are the biggest business expense,\u201d said Kate Nicholls, the group\u2019s chief executive. \u201cHospitality businesses are much less able to stomach yet another cost increase, when they\u2019re already managing increases in other areas like wages, food, drink and energy.\u201d The global economy is a volatile place and politicians trying to cope with the ups and downs should be cut some slack, the International Monetary Fund appears to be saying in its latest message ahead of the Washington-based organisation\u2019s annual meetings next week. Uncertainty about where the global economy is going has been higher since the Covid-19 pandemic and the inflation shocks that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the IMF says in an advanced chapter of its Global Financial Stability Review, just released. Rising tensions from the ongoing situation in Ukraine and the middle east conflict are only adding to the difficulties for all governments of making economic and social policies that give a degree of certainty to households and businesses. Uncertainty, says the IMF, is a growth killer. The lender of last resort says it has evidence from the 2008 banking crash, when the lack of certainty reduced GDP growth a year ahead by 1.2 percentage points on average in advanced and emerging market economies. The uncertainy also persuades central banks to keep interest rates higher than they would otherwise do, crippling with higher interest bills those businesses and governments that have allowed their debts to pile up in the good times, when interest rates were low. However, politicians are not entirely off the hook. The IMF says governments should avoid the temptation to loosen regulations that allow for reckless borowing to boost growth. It said politicians should maintain and enhance regulations limiting the risks that banks and other financial services can take. Governments should also \u201cbuild adequate international reserve buffers and allow exchange rate flexibility to help cushion the adverse spillover effects of an increase in foreign macroeconomic uncertainty\u201d, the Fund says. This is a message to Beijing and Washington to resist promoting a strong currency as a policy goal when that can distort global financial markets. Rachel Reeves has been urged to abandon Labour\u2019s manifesto promise and raise national insurance for workers in the budget \u2013 by her former boss at the Bank of England, Mervyn King. In an article for the Independent, King says that it was \u201creckless\u201d for the Tories to cut national insurance before the general election, that both main parties were \u201cirresponsible\u201d when they said they would not reverse those cuts and that it would be best for the government to put it back up. Shares in computer chip equipment maker ASML have fallen sharply this afternoon after the company\u2019s third quarter earnings were published early in an apparent error and showed the company was downbeat on its 2025 sales. They showed that chief executive Christophe Fouquet said in a statement: \u201cWe expect our 2025 total net sales to grow to a range between 30-35 billion euros, which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day,\u201d Shares were down 15% at \u20ac673.60. The EU\u2019s plans to ban the manufacture of traditional combustion engines from 2035 will shrink the industry, BMW\u2019s chief executive has warned as the German car industry battles with increased competition from China in the electric vehicle sector. In a comment that will alarm Brussels, Oliver Zipse told the Paris motor show the 2035 cutoff point for CO2-emitting cars was \u201cno longer realistic\u201d. The ban \u201ccould also threaten the European automotive industry in its heart,\u201d Zipse said. The measures will \u201cwith today\u2019s assumptions, lead to a massive shrinking of the industry as a whole\u201d. Investment giant BlackRock gave the UK a thumbs-up today, advising clients to buy British government debt. BlackRock\u2019s research arm upgraded its call on UK government bonds to overweight from neutral. They predicted the Bank of England will slash interest rates faster than expected by markets, meaning the current rates of return on bonds will not be available for long. \u201cWe are overweight,\u201d BlackRock strategists including Wei Li wrote in a weekly note, adding: \u201cGilt yields offer attractive income, and we think the Bank of England will cut rates more than the market is pricing given a soft economy.\u201d Bloomberg has more details. Back in the US, shares in pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance have jumped over 4% in premarket trading after it announced a store closure programme. Walgreens Boots plans to shut 1,200 stores over the next three years. Energy provider SSE have reportedly rebuffed a merger approach from Portuguese utility EDP. According to Reuters, EDP approached SSE before the summer about a possible merger, but were turned down. Sources say the two companies are not currently in talks. Shares in SSE have jumped by 1.5%, while EDP are 1.2% higher today. Just in: Manufacturing activity in New York state has weakened, in a worrying sign for the US economy. The monthly Empire State Manufacturing Survey, produced by the New York Federal Reserve, has found that business conditions have weakened this month. Factory bosses reported that new orders, and shipments, both weakened in October. This helped to pull the general business conditions index down by twenty-three points to -11.9 this month. Richard Deitz, economic research advisor at the New York Fed, says: \u201cManufacturing activity contracted modestly in New York State in October, with firms reporting that new orders declined. Despite this contraction, employment expanded for the first time in a year, though by a small degree, and optimism about the outlook grew strongly.\u201d Boeing\u2019s share price has risen slightly in pre-market trading, up over 1%, after it announced its new $10bn credit agreement and plans to raise $25bn in debt and equity. Boeing has also agreed a $10bn credit agreement with a consortium of major banks. The deal, with Bank of America, Citibank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase will help Boeing shore up its balance sheet, which is under more pressure as its workers\u2019 strike continues. Troubled aeroplane maker Boeing is looking to raise $25bn from investors. Booeing has issued a regulatory filing explaining that it plans to raise the money through issuing new debt and equity. The fund-raising comes as the strike by Boeing workers enters its second month. Employees walked out in mid-September after rejecting a pay offer, putting the company into a deeper financial crisis, and the two side have not made a breakthrough since. Yesterday, U.S. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su met with the company and unions in Seattle in a bid to break the deadlock. Boeing factory workers are expected to hold a large rally in Seattle later today to demand a better wage deal. Late last week, CEO Kelly Ortberg announce Boeing will cut 17,000 jobs -- 10% of its global workforce -- and delay first deliveries of its 777X jet by a year, due to the strike. Profits have surged at investment bank Goldman Sachs. Goldman has reported pre-tax profits of $3.987bn for the third quarter of this year, up from $2.756bn in Q3 2023. Revenues at its Global Banking &amp; Markets division rose by 7%, to $8.55bn, including a \u201cstrong performance in equities\u201d and record quarterly net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) financing. David Solomon, chairman and chief executive officer, says: Our performance demonstrates the strength of our world-class franchise in an improving operating environment. We continue to lean into our strengths \u2013 exceptional talent, execution capabilities and risk management expertise \u2013 allowing us to effectively serve our clients against a complex backdrop and deliver for shareholders.\u201d Global public debt is on track to exceed $100tn by the end of this year, the International Monetary Fund has warned. In its latest fiscal monitor report, the Fund says: Global public debt is very high. It is expected to exceed $100 trillion, or about 93% of global gross domestic product by the end of this year and will approach 100% of GDP by 2030. This is 10 percentage points of GDP above 2019, that is, before the pandemic. The IMF is worried that this high debt reduces the fiscal space available to governments to respond to economic downturns, making it harder to make growth-enhancing investments. It also raises the risk of sovereign distress \u2013 ie, countries struggling to repay their debts. The Fund is also concerned that the fiscal outlook of many countries might be worse than expected \u2013 it cites three reasons: large spending pressures, optimism bias of debt projections, and sizable unidentified debt. It adds: And countries will need to increasingly spend more to cope with aging and healthcare; with the green transition and climate adaptation; and with defense and energy security, due to growing geopolitical tensions. This means that debt-to-GDP ratios in five-years time could be as much as 10 percentage points of GDP higher than projected on average, it warns \u2013 if, for example, growth was weaker than expected or financial conditions are tighter. Russia news service RIA is reporting that the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office is seeing more than \u20ac1bn in damages from energy giant Shell. Earlier this morning, the Moscow Arbitration Court agreed to hold a preliminary hearing for December 11 on the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office\u2019s lawsuit against Shell. It was reported last week that Moscow was looking to recover around $1bn awarded to Shell when Russia expropriated its stake in the country\u2019s Sakhalin 2 oil and gas development in 2022. Oil prices have fallen further, after the IEA predicted a \u2018sizeable surplus\u2019 in the new year (see last post). Brent crude is now down 4.7% so far today at $73.81 per barrel (still nearly a two-week low), a drop of $3.65 per barrel. The global oil market is heading towards a \u201csizeable surplus in the new year\u201d, the International Energy Agency has predicted. In its monthly oil market report, the IEA points out that the global oil market looks \u201cadequately supplied\u201d. They predict that global oil demand is expected to grow by just under 900 kb/d in 2024 and by around 1 mb/d in 2025, significantly lower than the 2 mb/d seen in 2023. But oil suppy is set to rise faster, with non-Opec members set to increase supply by 1.5 million barrels per day this year, and in 2025. The IEA says: The United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada are set to account for most of the increase, boosting output by over 1 mb/d both years, which will more than cover expected demand growth. The IEA also points out that it could act quickly, if there is significant disruption to supplies, saying: IEA public stocks alone are over 1.2 billion barrels, with an additional half a billion barrels of stocks held under industry obligations. China holds a further 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil stocks, enough to cover 75 days of domestic refinery runs at current rates. For now, supply keeps flowing, and in the absence of a major disruption, the market is faced with a sizeable surplus in the new year. Economic confidence in Germany has improved this month, even though current conditions have worsened. Economic research institute ZEW has reported that hopes of stable inflation, and cuts to eurozone interest rates, lifted optimism this month. There are also hopes of a pick-up in exports to the eurozone, the USA, and China. This has lifted the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany to 13.1 points this month, a 9.5-point increase on September. But, the assessment of the economic situation in Germany continued to worsen \u2013 dropping by 2.4 points to -86.9 points. Nearly nine out of ten respondents assessing the current economic situation as negative. The most important news for the Bank of England today was wages, which are clearly on a slowing path, says economist George Buckley of Japanese bank Nomura. He told clients: That should give room for the BoE to cut rates again next month. The unemployment rate is either at or below its equilibrium, and while vacancies have fallen to 2019 levels the market was reasonably tight back then. I missed this earlier, but the estimate for total pay growth across Britain in May-July has been revised up to 4.1%, up from 4.0% reported last month. That\u2019s not insignificant, as this is the earnings data used to set the pensions triple lock. Last month, we calculated that a 4% rise would lift pensions by \u00a3460 a year\u2026. \u2026 If it\u2019s 4.1%, that would mean a \u00a3471 increase to the annual pension. UK business failures are on track to hit a 12-year high this year, new research shows. Allianz Trade has predicted that UK business insolvencies will rise by 5% this year to over 29,000, a 12-year high and around 30% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Insolvencies are then set to plateau, predicted to dip to 27,500 in 2025 and 26,300 in 2026. Alllianz Trade says: Firms have been struggling over the past years due to the succession of shocks and challenges, from Brexit-related issues and the Covid-19 shock, to strong monetary tightening and sticky inflation As the UK\u2019s growth momentum should recover heading into 2025, we expect a gradual relief for firms that would translate into slightly lower number of business insolvencies. Their latest global insolvency report also flags that major insolvencies have also reached a new record high level, with Western Europe leading this trend. This also poses a major threat to employment, particularly in Europe and North America, they point out. Newsflash: The OECD Working Group on Bribery has cancelled a high-level mission to Hungary today, saying Budapest failed to engage with the visit. The OECD Working Group on Bribery had been due to visit the Hungarian capital today and tomorrow, but scrapped the trip \u201cafter the Government of Hungary was unable to secure sufficient representation of Ministers and senior officials for the meeting\u201d. This is the first time a high-level mission has been cancelled, the OECD says. The visit was set up to address the Government of Hungary\u2019s failure to make tangible progress in addressing long-standing recommendations on bribery, it says. The OECD explains: These recommendations relate to the Government of Hungary\u2019s lack of understanding of foreign bribery risk exposure, absence of strategy for proactively detecting and investigating foreign bribery cases, inadequate time to apply investigative measures and lack of legal clarity in relation to corporate responsibility for foreign bribery. The Working Group also remains seriously concerned about Hungary\u2019s low level of foreign bribery enforcement. Back in January 2023, the OECD said Hungary should urgently implement long-standing OECD Anti-Bribery recommendations, enforce its foreign bribery laws and improve its engagement with the Working Group on Bribery. It warned then that no significant case of foreign bribery has been detected or investigated since March 2012. Recruiter Robert Walters has reported that uncertainty over Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget is cooling demand for new workers. Net fee income at the company fell 19% in the UK in the third quarter of this year, including a 29% drop in recruitment across Britain\u2019s regions. Robert Walters says: Clients [are] generally pausing activity pending clarity on employment legislation and fiscal measures of the new UK government in the late October Budget. In Europe, net fees fell 13%, including a 17% drop in France where hiring was \u201cmuted\u201d due to the Paris Olympics. There seemed to be enough in this morning\u2019s UK employment data to justify a rate cut in November, says analyst Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Wilson writes: Average earnings declined to 4.9% from 5.1%; and whilst the unemployment rate ticked down, employment fell by 35k, and vacancies were down; at 841k now 36% below the March 2022 peak. Look around and you can see the end of the worker power in terms of openings and pay growth. Today\u2019s UK jobs report gives a clear sign that the labour market is cooling. And that adds to the dilemma facing chancellor Rachel Reeves, as she ponders how she can raise taxes to pay for better public services. Yesterday, Reeves appeared to hint that she will raise employer national insurance contributions in the budget later this month. But that would push up the cost of employing staff, just as demand for workers appears to be falling. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Make no mistake, the labour market is in pretty good shape. There are a record number of people in work and the jobless rate stands at 4%. The 14 consecutive increases in interest rates between December 2021 and August last year have proved less damaging to jobs than expected. That said, dearer borrowing costs have still had an impact and that has arrived \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 after a lag. The number of job vacancies fell by 34,000 between July and September \u2013 the 27th drop in a row and 36% below its peak in May 2022. Meanwhile, the number of payrolled employees dropped slightly in September. The latest figures also suggest companies have put hiring on hold until they know what Reeves has in store on 30 October. The British Chambers of Commerce and the Institute of Directors have said businesses were particularly worried about a possible NI increase in the budget. Slower earnings growth reflects weaker demand for labour. Annual total pay growth \u2013 including basic pay and bonuses \u2013 stood at 3.8% in the three months to August, down from 4.1% for the previous month and less than half the 8% a year earlier. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis: The crude oil price has fallen sharply this morning, as fears ease that Israel might attack Iran\u2019s oil facilities. Brent crude, the international benchmark, has fallen by 4% this morning to $74.30 per barrel, a drop of over $3 per barrel. That\u2019s its lowest level in almost two weeks. US crude is also down around 4% at $70.80 per barrel. The fall comes after the Washington Post reported that Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US President Joe Biden that Israel\u2019s retaliation against Iran for its ballistic missile attack earlier this month will not include strikes on non-military sites. That suggests Israel is willing not to strike Iranian oil targets, which eased fears of disruption to supplies from the Middle East. Traders are also pricing in weaker demand for energy, after the Opec cartel yesterday cut its forecast for demand growth this year, mainly due to weaker growth in China. Shares in oil companies have fallen this morning, with BP down 3.35% and Shell losing 2.4% in early trading. Airline shares are soaring, though, with EasyJet up 4.3% and IAG (which owns British Airways) 3.4% higher. A falling oil price will also help to ease inflationary pressures, making it easier for central banks to lower interest rates. Twice as many people are out of work sick than are officially unemployed, says Dr Helen Gray, chief economist of Learning and Work Institute: This month\u2019s data show that the number of people economically inactive due to long-term sickness remains elevated, at 2.8 million \u2013 double the number of people who are unemployed. This highlights the need for the forthcoming White Paper on the Plan to Get Britain Working to focus on joining up work, skills and health, and providing support to the 9-in-10 out-of-work disabled people each year who do not currently receive help to find work. Slowing pay growth is a sign of the Government\u2019s \u201cdifficult inheritance\u201d on the economy, a Treasury minister has said. Responding to this morning\u2019s data, exchequer secretary James Murray told Sky News: \u201cI think it\u2019s a sign of the difficult inheritance we have had as a Government, that the economy has been in a difficult position for a number of years. \u201cWhat we are focused on now is what we can do as a Government to get us on a better track.\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, suggests the Bank of England might squeeze in two interest rate cuts this year, at its two remaining meetings in November and December: \u201cWorrisome wage growth is in retreat, lifting expectations that borrowing costs will soon fall further. The rate of increase in average earnings (including bonuses) has fallen to 3.8%, a hugely significant drop given how pay growth had raced away in recent years. Although there had been forecasts for an even steeper fall, and wages are still beating inflation, this will still assuage concerns among policymakers about the risk that consumer price rises will pop back up into troublesome territory. The unemployment rate has dropped back, to 4%, which might give workers a little more bargaining power, but other data from across the recruitment industry highlighting wariness among employers who are hiring is likely to offset this in the short term. The pound has fallen further back against the dollar, to $1.303 after the wage data was published. It\u2019s an indication of the firming up of expectations of a rate cut in November, with another follow up reduction likely in December too.\u201d There were 9.26 million people classed as economically inactive (not working, or looking for a job) in June-August, today\u2019s labour force report shows. That\u2019s a drop of 120,000 over the quarter, but still near to record levels. Work and Pensions Secretary, Liz Kendall MP is concerned about the number of peopel out of work due to long-term sickness: \u201cTo get Britain growing again we need to get Britain working again. Millions of people are locked out of work due to long term sickness. This is not good for them, for our economy or for the taxpayer. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will bring forward the biggest reforms to employment support in a generation \u2013 overhauling jobcentres, delivering a Youth guarantee so every young person is learning or earning, and new work, health and skills plans to tackle inactivity \u2013 unlocking opportunity and potential in every area of the country.\u201d ONS data has shown that the majority of people inactive because of long-term sickness were aged 50 to 64. Health secretary Wes Streeting has suggested that new weight-loss jabs could be given to unemployed people to help them get back into work: Wages in Britain\u2019s public sector grew faster than in the private sector over the summer. Today\u2019s earnings data shows that average regular earnings (ex-bonuses) in the public sector grew by 5.2% in June-August, down from 5.7% a month ago. In the private sector, regular pay rose by 4.8% over the period, down from 5%, and the lowest rate since the three months to April 2022. However, if you include bonuses\u2026 then total pay rose by 4.7% for private sector workers but just 0.1% over the last year in the private sector (because we\u2019ve caught up with the bonuses paid to NHS and civil service staff in summer 2023). Several economists are predicting that today\u2019s slowdown in pay growth will encourage the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its next meeting in early November. Following the news that regular wage growth across Great Britain slowed to 4.9% in June to August, down from 5.1% a month ago, Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, says: The further fall in wage growth in August, together with some signs that the labour market continued to loosen gradually, adds further support to widespread expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates from 5.00% to 4.75% at the next policy meeting in November. Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, says that \u201cfor now, another interest rate cut in November looks nailed on\u201d, explaining: \u201cThe labour market report is unlikely to move the dial much on interest rate expectations. Wage growth continues to gradually moderate, but still needs to come down further to be fully consistent with the Bank of England\u2019s target. As flagged in the introduction, a cut in November was already seen as an 83% chance. This morning, it\u2019s inched up towards 85%. Monica George Michail, associate economist at NIESR, says: Easing wage pressures are supported by a notable fall in services sector pay growth, which recorded 3.6 per cent, down from an average of 5.6 per cent in the first half of this year. This is positive news for inflation and might provide the Bank of England with increased confidence regarding interest rate cuts\u201d. This time tomorrow we\u2019ll be digesting the latest CPI inflation data, which will also have a significant impact on the Bank\u2019s decision next month. Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, says: \u201cUK ex bonus wage growth cooled from 5.1% to 4.9% in the three months to August and vacancies continued to contract, while an untrustworthy LFS unemployment figure fell again to 4.0%. \u201cThe headline here is that the trend in the labour market is still going in the right direction for 2% inflation, and that should support a steady stream of rate cuts from the Bank of England. Labour demand is cooling off and that is returning some slack to the market, which is bringing down wage growth, and that should filter through into the all-important services inflation figure over the coming months. \u201cThe report certainly won\u2019t deter the BoE from cutting in November, although tomorrow\u2019s CPI figures are likely to be much more significant. Policymakers will take the hot unemployment figure with a pinch of salt - I\u2019m not sure anybody is taking it seriously right now given the volatility and its contrast with other indicators.\u201d In June to August, the highest employment rate in the UK was in the South West (78.8%) and the lowest was in Wales (69.8%), the Office for National Statistics reports. The highest unemployment rate was in the North East (5.6%) and the lowest was in Northern Ireland (1.9%). The highest economic inactivity rate was in Northern Ireland (28.5%) and the lowest was in the South West (18.6%). Companies are continuing to cut their vacancies \u2013 a sign that demand for labour is weakening, or of economic uncertainty. Today\u2019s jobs roert shows that vacancies in the UK decreased by 34,000 in July to September, to 841,000. That\u2019s the 27th drop in a row, as the hiring boom following the Covid-19 lockdowns continues to fade. However, vacancies are still above pre-pandemic levels. The UK\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest since the start of this year, today\u2019s labour force report shows. The jobless rate has dipped to 4% in the June to August quarter, its lowest since the three months to January. The number of people unemployed dropped to 1.386m, a fall of 141,000 in the quarter. In contrast, the employment rate rose over the quarter, to 75%, up from 74.8% last month. The economic inactivity rate (those neither working nor looking for work), slowed to 21.8% from 21.9%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Wage growth across Great Britain has slowed, as companies cut the number of workers on their payrolls. Data just released by the Office for National Statistics shows that regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 4.9% in June-August, down from 5.1% recorded in May-July. UPDATED: Total earnings (including bonuses), rose by 3.8% in the quarter, again slower than the 4.1% recorded a month ago (which has been revised up from 4.0% first reported). This growth rate is affected by the one-off bonus payments made to NHS and civil service staff in June, July and August 2023, the ONS points out. This data is closely watched by the financial markets, as it will influence how quickly the Bank of England can lower UK interest rates. Last night, a rate cut \u2013 from 5% to 4.75% \u2013 is seen as an 83% chance by the markets. Although wage growth has slowed, earnings are still rising faster than inflation. Using the CPI inflation measure, regular real pay rose by 2.6% on the year, lower than the previous three-month period when it was 3.0%. Total real pay rose by 1.7% on the year. The ONS also estimates that the number of employees on company payrolls fell by 35,000 in August, and by another 15,000 in September (that\u2019s an early estimate, though). David Freeman, head of the ONS Labour Market and Household Division, says: \u201cPay growth slowed again, with last year\u2019s one-off payments made to many public sector workers continuing to affect the figures for total pay. However, earnings continue to rise faster than inflation. \u201cOver the last three months the number of people on payrolls has stayed broadly flat. The Labour Force Survey shows a different picture and we would advise caution when interpreting changes in these data while we continue to improve survey responses. \u201cVacancies have fallen once more, with most industries seeing a fall on the quarter. However, the total still remains a little above its pre-pandemic level.\u201d The agenda 7am BST: UK labour market report 10am BST: ZEW economic sentiment index for Germany 10am IEA monthly oil Market Report 1.30pm NY Empire State manufacturing Index 2pm BST: IMF begins publishing analytical chapters of its Global Financial Stability Report 2.30pm BST: World Bank to release report on poverty and prosperity",

Still, they\u2019re somewhat elusive: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen all the time,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>How do nipple orgasms happen?</h2> <p>Nipples have long been considered an erogenous zone. Although there\u2019s no data estimating what proportion of people have experienced climax from nipple play, a 2006 <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1743609515313412\">study</a> found that 82% of women and 52% of men find nipple stimulation arousing.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 2011 that <a href=\"https://askdoctornan.com/\">Dr Nan Wise</a> \u2013 a New Jersey-based psychotherapist, sex therapist and neuroscientist \u2013 conducted a study revealing how nipple stimulation actually affects the brain.</p> <p>According to Wise, this study established that \u201cthe clitoris, vagina and cervix are mapped on the genital sensory cortex\u201d, a term Wise and her colleagues coined for the section nestled between the brain\u2019s two hemispheres<strong>, </strong>whichshe also calls the \u201chedonistic pleasure zone\u201d or \u201cthe crotch of the brain\u201d.</p> <p>To explore how different body parts activate the brain, Wise and her team asked research subjects to stimulate various areas and have different mental fantasies while lying in an MRI machine. This allowed them to observe how distinct parts of the brain responded to various experiences. For instance, when a woman imagined inserting a dildo in a sexual context, the genital sensory cortex lit up; however, when she imagined a medical speculum, there was no significant response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, \u2018Well Actually\u2019, then \u2018Read more on living a good life in a complex world,\u2019 then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say \u2018More from this section\u2019\u00a0\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>For the nipple stimulation portion, Wise had participants touch their left nipple. Initially, she expected to see activity in the brain region associated with chest sensation. Her theory was that nipple orgasms might occur because nipple stimulation releases oxytocin, a hormone that can cause uterine contractions, potentially leading to vaginal orgasm.</p> <p>But instead, she discovered that nipple stimulation activated the genital sensory cortex itself.</p> <p>\u201cThe nipples are a hardwired erogenous zone, like the genitals,\u201d Wise explains. \u201cWhen nipples are stimulated, the brain gets activated, and regions processing the sensation communicate with those responsible for pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have a saying in neuroscience,\u201d Wise says. \u201cNeurons that fire together wire together.\u201d This suggests that the \u201celectric wire\u201d connection Alex described may indeed reflect a tangible neural pathway between the nipples and the genitals.</p> <h2>How do you have a nipple orgasm?</h2> <p>Balik, the sexologist, embarked on a deliberate journey of learning how to make her breasts a source of greater pleasure. Beforehand, she \u201cactually had pretty desensitized nipples\u201d, Balik says.</p> <p>Balik started by focusing on sensual massage, along with deep breaths and relaxation. \u201cYou really want to warm up the body when you\u2019re going to stimulate a new area,\u201d she says. \u201cStart massaging your inner thighs, give your arms a squeeze, relax your neck.\u201d</p> <p>Balik recommends a technique called \u201cskipping\u201d, where you touch yourself, but intentionally omit the focus area, to \u201cbuild anticipation in your body\u201d.</p> <p>Another tantra technique she often recommends to clients is called pleasure transfer, which involves stimulating a \u201cvery pleasurable point in your body\u201d, such as the G-spot or clitoris, and \u201cintroducing stimulation of the nipple\u201d both separately and simultaneously as you build arousal. \u201cWhat this does is basically tell your brain \u2018this is very pleasurable,\u2019 and tell your body, \u2018this is an area of pleasure,\u2019\u201d says Balik. In time, you focus your touch on the area you\u2019re hoping to sensitize to orgasm \u2013 in this case, the nipples.</p> <p>People commonly find one nipple more sensitive than the other, or that nipple sensation changes with their hormonal cycle or mood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/09/uses-breast-milk-adults\">Breast milk for adults: wellness elixir or unscientific fascination?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Balik\u2019s experience and that of her clients, if you have desensitized nipples or have never had a nipple orgasm, patience and consistency can be key. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say how long it will take,\u201d she says. \u201cFor some people it might be the first try, for some it might be the 50th.\u201d</p> <p>For Balik, a nipplegasm doesn\u2019t feel similar to clitoral orgasms, but more like a \u201creally, really, really heightened sensation\u201d that \u201cspreads out starting from the nipple, this burst of tingling and pleasure\u201d.</p> <p>Wise also has advice for those seeking to experience their first nipple orgasm. Her method, \u201ctouch plus imagery\u201d, involves gently touching your body sensually without trying to masturbate, then alternating between touching and just imagining the feeling of that touch. This helps strengthen the connection between your brain and your body, making it easier to feel and enjoy sexual sensations. Over time, it can help you tune into your body and enhance your sexual experience.</p> <h2>What if I can\u2019t have a nipple orgasm?</h2> <p>If the nipple orgasm has one lesson for all of us, it\u2019s that the body brims with potential for pleasure. Wise describes pleasure points like nipples or the clitoris as \u201ckeys\u201d that, when pressed in tandem, amplify sexual experience. \u201cThe more of those keys that you activate, you\u2019re going to get a bigger bang for your buzz,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>One orgasm style accessible to many is the blended orgasm, where multiple erogenous zones are stimulated during a sexual encounter, even if the climax originates from just one. This technique creates a more intense, holistic erotic experience, transforming the sensation of isolated pleasure into one of full-body immersion.</p> <p>\u201cThis is about laying down pleasure pathways\u201d beyond just the genitals, Wise says, recognizing the body as a site of curiosity and pleasure beyond what we thought was possible.</p> <p>Wise emphasizes \u201cexperiencing\u201d rather than more goal-oriented language about \u201cachieving\u201d when referring to novel styles of orgasm.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to strive for nipple orgasms. Because when we start striving to achieve things, we go into performance mode,\u201d says Wise. \u201cFor women, we are so trained to be objects for other people.\u201d</p> <p>Alex has felt that pressure with someone who knew she had experienced a nipple orgasm. \u201cSometimes people get obsessed with the novelty of you having something within you that they\u2019ve never experienced in someone else,\u201d she says. \u201cI really hate that, because then they\u2019re too focused on making it happen and then you\u2019re like \u2026 \u2018it\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Balik says pressure can indeed distract from pleasure: \u201cIf you go in with the attachment to the orgasm, it\u2019s going to be much harder to receive the orgasm than if you go in with curiosity.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2024 to attribute to Dr Nan Wise and her colleagues the findings of the 2011 study and the coining of the term \u201cgenital sensory cortex\u201d.</p>",

But instead, she discovered that nipple stimulation activated the genital sensory cortex itself. \u201cThe nipples are a hardwired erogenous zone, like the genitals,\u201d Wise explains. \u201cWhen nipples are stimulated, the brain gets activated, and regions processing the sensation communicate with those responsible for pleasure.\u201d \u201cWe have a saying in neuroscience,\u201d Wise says. \u201cNeurons that fire together wire together.\u201d This suggests that the \u201celectric wire\u201d connection Alex described may indeed reflect a tangible neural pathway between the nipples and the genitals. How do you have a nipple orgasm? Balik, the sexologist, embarked on a deliberate journey of learning how to make her breasts a source of greater pleasure. Beforehand, she \u201cactually had pretty desensitized nipples\u201d, Balik says. Balik started by focusing on sensual massage, along with deep breaths and relaxation. \u201cYou really want to warm up the body when you\u2019re going to stimulate a new area,\u201d she says. \u201cStart massaging your inner thighs, give your arms a squeeze, relax your neck.\u201d Balik recommends a technique called \u201cskipping\u201d, where you touch yourself, but intentionally omit the focus area, to \u201cbuild anticipation in your body\u201d. Another tantra technique she often recommends to clients is called pleasure transfer, which involves stimulating a \u201cvery pleasurable point in your body\u201d, such as the G-spot or clitoris, and \u201cintroducing stimulation of the nipple\u201d both separately and simultaneously as you build arousal. \u201cWhat this does is basically tell your brain \u2018this is very pleasurable,\u2019 and tell your body, \u2018this is an area of pleasure,\u2019\u201d says Balik. In time, you focus your touch on the area you\u2019re hoping to sensitize to orgasm \u2013 in this case, the nipples. People commonly find one nipple more sensitive than the other, or that nipple sensation changes with their hormonal cycle or mood. In Balik\u2019s experience and that of her clients, if you have desensitized nipples or have never had a nipple orgasm, patience and consistency can be key. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say how long it will take,\u201d she says. \u201cFor some people it might be the first try, for some it might be the 50th.\u201d For Balik, a nipplegasm doesn\u2019t feel similar to clitoral orgasms, but more like a \u201creally, really, really heightened sensation\u201d that \u201cspreads out starting from the nipple, this burst of tingling and pleasure\u201d. Wise also has advice for those seeking to experience their first nipple orgasm. Her method, \u201ctouch plus imagery\u201d, involves gently touching your body sensually without trying to masturbate, then alternating between touching and just imagining the feeling of that touch. This helps strengthen the connection between your brain and your body, making it easier to feel and enjoy sexual sensations. Over time, it can help you tune into your body and enhance your sexual experience. What if I can\u2019t have a nipple orgasm? If the nipple orgasm has one lesson for all of us, it\u2019s that the body brims with potential for pleasure. Wise describes pleasure points like nipples or the clitoris as \u201ckeys\u201d that, when pressed in tandem, amplify sexual experience. \u201cThe more of those keys that you activate, you\u2019re going to get a bigger bang for your buzz,\u201d she explains. One orgasm style accessible to many is the blended orgasm, where multiple erogenous zones are stimulated during a sexual encounter, even if the climax originates from just one. This technique creates a more intense, holistic erotic experience, transforming the sensation of isolated pleasure into one of full-body immersion. \u201cThis is about laying down pleasure pathways\u201d beyond just the genitals, Wise says, recognizing the body as a site of curiosity and pleasure beyond what we thought was possible. Wise emphasizes \u201cexperiencing\u201d rather than more goal-oriented language about \u201cachieving\u201d when referring to novel styles of orgasm. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to strive for nipple orgasms. Because when we start striving to achieve things, we go into performance mode,\u201d says Wise. \u201cFor women, we are so trained to be objects for other people.\u201d Alex has felt that pressure with someone who knew she had experienced a nipple orgasm. \u201cSometimes people get obsessed with the novelty of you having something within you that they\u2019ve never experienced in someone else,\u201d she says. \u201cI really hate that, because then they\u2019re too focused on making it happen and then you\u2019re like \u2026 \u2018it\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019\u201d Balik says pressure can indeed distract from pleasure: \u201cIf you go in with the attachment to the orgasm, it\u2019s going to be much harder to receive the orgasm than if you go in with curiosity.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2024 to attribute to Dr Nan Wise and her colleagues the findings of the 2011 study and the coining of the term \u201cgenital sensory cortex\u201d.",

The agency moved some beacons closer to the border, where more people have been found dead or in distress. Border patrol says it rescued nearly 1,000 migrants near the US border in New Mexico and western Texas over the past 12 months \u2013 up from about 600 the previous 12 months. Civilians organizations are ramping up their efforts, too. Dylan Corbett, executive director of the faith-based Hope Border Institute in El Paso, said 10-member church teams recently started dropping water bottles for those in the deadly New Mexico corridor alongside fluttering blue flags. \u201cPart of the problem is that organized crime has become very systematic in the area,\u201d Corbett said of the increased deaths. But Corbett also blamed heightened border enforcement in Texas and new US asylum restrictions introduced by Joe Biden in June and tightened last month. New Mexico\u2019s rising deaths come as the human-caused climate crisis increases the likelihood of heatwaves. This year, the El Paso area had its hottest June ever, with an average temperature of 89.4F (32C). 12 and 13 June saw daily record highs of 109F. Those high temperatures can be deadly for people who have been on strenuous journeys. Some smugglers lead migrants on longer routes into gullies or by the towering Mount Cristo Rey statue of Jesus Christ that casts a shadow over neighboring Mexico. Juan Bernal, the El Paso sector\u2019s interim deputy chief border patrol agent, said migrants were weak when they arrive at the border after weeks or months without adequate food and water in houses smugglers keep in Mexico. \u201cThey\u2019re expected to walk, sometimes for hours or days, to get to their destination where they\u2019re going to be picked up,\u201d he said. Nearly half of those who died in New Mexico this year were women, with women aged 20 to 29 making up the largest segment of these deaths. Adding concern is that the deaths have continued even as migration has fallen along the entire border following Biden\u2019s major asylum restrictions. New Mexico\u2019s migrant death numbers now rival those in Arizona\u2019s even hotter Sonoran desert, where the remains of 114 presumed border crossers were discovered during the first eight months of 2024, according to a mapping project by the non-profit Humane Borders and the Pima county medical examiner\u2019s office in Tucson. \u201cIt should not be a death sentence to come to the United States,\u201d Maj Jon Day of Do\u00f1a Ana county sheriff\u2019s office, told a recent community gathering. \u201cAnd when we push them into the desert areas here, they\u2019re coming across and they\u2019re dying.\u201d",

The movement is banned in India and its most vocal advocates are primarily among the Punjabi overseas diaspora. Nijjar was wanted by Indian authorities and had been designated a \u201cterrorist\u201d in July 2020 for alleged Khalistani-related violence.</p> <p>In September, Trudeau took the unusual step of publicly stating that there was \u201ccredible\u201d information linking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/18/credible-evidence-india-behind-killing-of-canadian-sikh-leader-says-trudeau\">Indian government agents to the murder</a> of Nijjar. India vehemently rejected the allegations as \u201cabsurd\u201d and accused Canada of harbouring terrorists and \u201canti-Indian elements\u201d who were a threat to the Indian state.</p> <p>India then expelled a senior Canadian diplomat and ordered Canada to remove 41 diplomats from its embassy in Delhi. It also suspended all visa applications for Canadians.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Canadian police arrested three Indian nationals accused of being part of the hit squad that killed Nijjar and said they were were \u201cinvestigating if there are any ties to the government of India\u201d. India rejected the allegations, saying Canada had a \u201cpolitical compulsion\u201d to blame it.</p> <h2><strong>What new allegations have Canadian police made?</strong></h2> <p>This week, in an explosive press conference, Canadian police officials claimed they had uncovered evidence that senior Indian diplomats and consular officials had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/india-canada-expel-top-diplomats-escalating-row-sikh-activists-death-hardeep-singh-nijjar\">involved in a \u201ccriminal network\u201d</a> that had carried out homicides and harassed and threatened Canadian Sikhs.</p> <p>Canadian police alleged that Indian diplomats and consular staff in Canada had been extorting, threatening and coercing people for information and had been gathering intelligence on individuals suspected of being involved with the Khalistan movement.</p> <p>They also said they believed Indian agents had been working with a criminal network, run by India\u2019s most notorious mob boss, Lawrence Bishnoi, to carry out targeted attacks and killings.</p> <p>Canadian officials also said they had evidence that implicated India\u2019s top diplomat in Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma, and other consular staff in the Nijjar\u2019s killing.</p> <p>In a subsequent press conference, Trudeau doubled down on the accusations, stating that Canada now had \u201cclear and compelling evidence that agents of the government of India have engaged in, and continue to engage in, activities that pose a significant threat to public safety\u201d.</p> <p>Trudeau said he had spoken directly to Modi last week and that top national security officials from both countries had met in Singapore over the weekend, where Canadian officials shared the evidence they had collected, detailing Indian involvement in violence and attacks, which India had denied.</p> <p>Trudeau added that India had \u201cmade a monumental mistake in choosing to use their diplomats and organised crime to attack Canadians\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>How has India responded?</strong></h2> <p>After Canada informed the Indian government that Indian diplomats were \u201cpersons of interest\u201d in the Nijjar murder investigation, India\u2019s foreign ministry responded with outrage.</p> <p>In a statement on Monday, the Indian government rejected the accusations as \u201cpreposterous imputations\u201d and accused the Trudeau government of a \u201cpolitical agenda\u201d.</p> <p>Contrary to claims by the Canadian police and Trudeau, Delhi has maintained that Ottawa has not shared any credible evidence to back up its claims of an Indian link to the murder.</p> <p>India has also repeatedly accused Trudeau of being sympathetic to Khalistani separatists, as his party enjoys substantial backing from the country\u2019s sizeable Sikh community. Canada has the highest population of Sikhs outside their home state of Punjab.</p> <p>On Monday night, India announced it was \u201cwithdrawing\u201d six senior diplomats from Canada over safety concerns. However, Canadian officials who briefed several news publications said Canada had expelled the Indian diplomats first.</p>    <h2><strong>Who else has been targeted?</strong></h2> <p>Nijjar is not the only Khalistani activist living abroad believed to have been targeted by the Indian government.</p> <p>Sikh activists and western officials have said that evidence increasingly points to the Modi government carrying out a campaign of transnational repression, which is when foreign governments take actions beyond their borders to intimidate, silence harass or harm members of their diaspora and exile communities.</p> <p>Last November, US investigators said they had thwarted an attempt by an Indian government official to murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/19/us-lawyer-alleged-murder-plot-india-death-threats\">Gurpatwant Singh Pannun</a>, a firebrand Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the US and Canada.</p> <p>Other prominent Sikh Khalistani activists in the US, Canada and the UK also said they had also been given warnings of threats to their lives.</p> <p>According to intelligence officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/04/indian-government-assassination-allegations-pakistan-intelligence-officials\">who spoke to the Guardian this year</a>, India had also ordered the assassination of dozens of individuals in Pakistan, including Sikhs, as part of a wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil.</p> <h2><strong>What happens now?</strong></h2> <p>Bilateral relations between India and Canada have now completely broken down and show little sign of improving any time soon.</p> <p>Canada has said that its investigation into the Nijjar killing and the alleged wider campaign of violence by India is continuing and it is collaborating with the Five Eyes, an intelligence-sharing alliance comprising the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p> <p>India has insisted that it has yet to see adequate evidence to back up Canada\u2019s claims against Indian diplomats, and Canada will be under mounting pressure to go public with what it alleges to have uncovered and to officially press charges.</p> <p>The US has said it took the allegations of India\u2019s involvement in attempted killings on US soil \u201cwith utmost seriousness\u201d. On Monday, the US state department said an Indian inquiry committee set up to investigate the plot would travel to Washington on Tuesday as part of its investigations.</p> <p>Canada\u2019s foreign minister noted on Monday that India was cooperating with US officials but said it had refused to cooperate in the Canadian investigation.</p> <p>The saga could have significant geopolitical implications. India is seen as a growing superpower and has become an important security and economic ally for western countries such as the US, UK and France. However, those relationships could be complicated if evidence mounts that the Modi government has been complicit in transnational repression.</p>",

Nijjar was wanted by Indian authorities and had been designated a \u201cterrorist\u201d in July 2020 for alleged Khalistani-related violence. In September, Trudeau took the unusual step of publicly stating that there was \u201ccredible\u201d information linking Indian government agents to the murder of Nijjar. India vehemently rejected the allegations as \u201cabsurd\u201d and accused Canada of harbouring terrorists and \u201canti-Indian elements\u201d who were a threat to the Indian state. India then expelled a senior Canadian diplomat and ordered Canada to remove 41 diplomats from its embassy in Delhi. It also suspended all visa applications for Canadians. Earlier this year, Canadian police arrested three Indian nationals accused of being part of the hit squad that killed Nijjar and said they were were \u201cinvestigating if there are any ties to the government of India\u201d. India rejected the allegations, saying Canada had a \u201cpolitical compulsion\u201d to blame it. What new allegations have Canadian police made? This week, in an explosive press conference, Canadian police officials claimed they had uncovered evidence that senior Indian diplomats and consular officials had been involved in a \u201ccriminal network\u201d that had carried out homicides and harassed and threatened Canadian Sikhs. Canadian police alleged that Indian diplomats and consular staff in Canada had been extorting, threatening and coercing people for information and had been gathering intelligence on individuals suspected of being involved with the Khalistan movement. They also said they believed Indian agents had been working with a criminal network, run by India\u2019s most notorious mob boss, Lawrence Bishnoi, to carry out targeted attacks and killings. Canadian officials also said they had evidence that implicated India\u2019s top diplomat in Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma, and other consular staff in the Nijjar\u2019s killing. In a subsequent press conference, Trudeau doubled down on the accusations, stating that Canada now had \u201cclear and compelling evidence that agents of the government of India have engaged in, and continue to engage in, activities that pose a significant threat to public safety\u201d. Trudeau said he had spoken directly to Modi last week and that top national security officials from both countries had met in Singapore over the weekend, where Canadian officials shared the evidence they had collected, detailing Indian involvement in violence and attacks, which India had denied. Trudeau added that India had \u201cmade a monumental mistake in choosing to use their diplomats and organised crime to attack Canadians\u201d. How has India responded? After Canada informed the Indian government that Indian diplomats were \u201cpersons of interest\u201d in the Nijjar murder investigation, India\u2019s foreign ministry responded with outrage. In a statement on Monday, the Indian government rejected the accusations as \u201cpreposterous imputations\u201d and accused the Trudeau government of a \u201cpolitical agenda\u201d. Contrary to claims by the Canadian police and Trudeau, Delhi has maintained that Ottawa has not shared any credible evidence to back up its claims of an Indian link to the murder. India has also repeatedly accused Trudeau of being sympathetic to Khalistani separatists, as his party enjoys substantial backing from the country\u2019s sizeable Sikh community. Canada has the highest population of Sikhs outside their home state of Punjab. On Monday night, India announced it was \u201cwithdrawing\u201d six senior diplomats from Canada over safety concerns. However, Canadian officials who briefed several news publications said Canada had expelled the Indian diplomats first. Who else has been targeted? Nijjar is not the only Khalistani activist living abroad believed to have been targeted by the Indian government. Sikh activists and western officials have said that evidence increasingly points to the Modi government carrying out a campaign of transnational repression, which is when foreign governments take actions beyond their borders to intimidate, silence harass or harm members of their diaspora and exile communities. Last November, US investigators said they had thwarted an attempt by an Indian government official to murder Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a firebrand Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the US and Canada. Other prominent Sikh Khalistani activists in the US, Canada and the UK also said they had also been given warnings of threats to their lives. According to intelligence officials who spoke to the Guardian this year, India had also ordered the assassination of dozens of individuals in Pakistan, including Sikhs, as part of a wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil. What happens now? Bilateral relations between India and Canada have now completely broken down and show little sign of improving any time soon. Canada has said that its investigation into the Nijjar killing and the alleged wider campaign of violence by India is continuing and it is collaborating with the Five Eyes, an intelligence-sharing alliance comprising the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. India has insisted that it has yet to see adequate evidence to back up Canada\u2019s claims against Indian diplomats, and Canada will be under mounting pressure to go public with what it alleges to have uncovered and to officially press charges. The US has said it took the allegations of India\u2019s involvement in attempted killings on US soil \u201cwith utmost seriousness\u201d. On Monday, the US state department said an Indian inquiry committee set up to investigate the plot would travel to Washington on Tuesday as part of its investigations. Canada\u2019s foreign minister noted on Monday that India was cooperating with US officials but said it had refused to cooperate in the Canadian investigation. The saga could have significant geopolitical implications. India is seen as a growing superpower and has become an important security and economic ally for western countries such as the US, UK and France. However, those relationships could be complicated if evidence mounts that the Modi government has been complicit in transnational repression.",

      "body": "<p>Rose Matafeo is bad at endings. So bad that, after stepping away from standup in 2018, the New Zealand-born comic is now back with a new show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/aug/17/rose-matafeo-on-and-on-and-on-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh\">On and On and On</a>. The return was prompted by some significant endings in her life: bereavement, breakups, her TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/apr/25/starstruck-review-rose-matafeo-stars-in-a-millennial-fairytale\">Starstruck</a>, her 20s. \u201cI was surprised with how bad I was at all types of ending,\u201d she says. \u201cThe show is me coming to terms with that. Things end: it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Since Matafeo\u2019s 2018 show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/10/rose-matafeo-horndog-review-pleasance-courtyard\">Horndog</a> earned her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/25/rose-matafeo-wins-edinburgh-best-comedy-show-award\">the Edinburgh comedy award</a>, there hasn\u2019t been much time for standup. She starred in the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/21/baby-done-review-rose-matafeo-is-wonderful-in-irresistible-film-about-parenthood\">Baby Done</a>, appeared on Taskmaster, was appointed host of Junior Taskmaster and made three series of Starstruck with her co-writer Alice Snedden.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I project a very different idea of myself on stage, much  louder than in real life. I\u2019m almost mute off stage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When death and breakups arrived just as she was editing the final series of Starstruck, \u201cI went into a real hole of Buddhism podcasts, because I was totally spun out,\u201d she says. It\u2019s debatable whether it helped: \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that impermanence is the only certain thing in life. It\u2019s the most terrifying thought in the world. And the only way you\u2019ll find peace.\u201d</p> <p>She returned to the \u201cimmediacy\u201d of standup, where you can have a thought one morning and discuss it on stage that night, to explore these ideas. \u201cThat was very helpful. And fun. And you get a show out of it \u2013 that\u2019s cool.\u201d</p>    <p>Today, we\u2019re in London chatting over tea and the most antipodean item on the menu \u2013 a platter of lamingtons, which are light sponges coated in coconut. Having been in London for nearly a decade, she received indefinite leave to remain in the UK last year. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever expected to be here this long,\u201d she says. She feels connected to New Zealand \u2013 it\u2019s where her career began and she still has family there \u2013 and committing to London means a life with \u201cone foot in, one foot out\u201d.</p> <p>So what made her stay? She loves the city\u2019s cinemas (she featured two favourites in Starstruck, and last year programmed films at another), the buses and \u201cgood friends, good comedy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my 20s here and that is such a formative time,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you go through enough life crises in a certain country, you deserve that fucking passport!\u201d</p> <p>Life crises are the meat of On and On and On. She debuted it at this year\u2019s Edinburgh fringe; now she\u2019s doing an extended London run and filming it for release \u2013 her second comedy special.</p> <p>She has been doing standup on and off since she was 15, thanks to a <a href=\"https://comedytrust.org.nz/trust-initiatives/class-comedians/\">New Zealand initiative</a> giving kids the mentorship of professional comics, and she has won the biggest prize in comedy. And yet: \u201cPerforming will never be easy for me. I think I have stage fright,\u201d Matafeo says. \u201cI do find that slightly confusing about myself. I\u2019m like, \u2018Why are you making a show? No one asked you to.\u2019 Yet I have this urge to write an hour about my feelings and talk about it on stage.\u201d</p> <p>Matafeo, now 32, posits on stage that breakups in your 30s hit harder because your personality is locked in. Yet she is uncomfortable quantifying her own personality, other than one certainty: \u201cI\u2019m an introvert,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m projecting a very different idea of myself on stage, a much more extroverted version, louder than in real life. I\u2019m almost mute off stage.\u201d</p>    <p>She is embracing her introversion now. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m like, \u2018Do I want to go to this party? Do I want to speak to this person?\u2019 I don\u2019t think I used to have the confidence of my male peers to go, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna do that.\u2019 That\u2019s a revelation as you get older. I can listen to my mind and body. Like, \u2018I actually don\u2019t like doing that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Starstruck asked big questions about the types of love that can enrich our lives. In the third series, Matafeo\u2019s character Jessie is still navigating a relationship with her ex while friends are having children and getting married, and she realises others expect the same for her. The existential issues facing Jessie are \u201cnow coming true\u201d for Matafeo, she says. \u201cWhen marriage or having kids, those milestones of adulthood, are things you don\u2019t want, it\u2019s harder to be like, \u2018I got this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Matafeo says that, like Jessie, she doesn\u2019t want kids \u2013 not now, probably not ever. She usually avoids reading reviews but was alerted to one fringe item in which a male critic suggested she\u2019ll change her mind. \u201cI was <em>howling</em>. \u2018You did not listen to anything I said!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Society has so far to go on this, she says. It shouldn\u2019t be remarkable for a woman to eschew parenthood, but it is a personal choice that still feels political. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly having to defend your position. It\u2019s hard because I\u2019m so excited for my friends who have started to have kids, but you are pitted against each other.\u201d</p> <p>While she doesn\u2019t think that male critic was correct, she is anxious for the future. \u201cMany people don\u2019t live in communities where they\u2019re taken care of as elderly people, so I\u2019m going to get rich enough to get an AI carer and live in a commune of like-minded older people.\u201d</p> <p>She is adamant that nothing she, or any comedian, says on stage should be taken as wisdom though. \u201cThis is just me at this moment. It\u2019s a snapshot,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the live show, there are more questions than answers. What is next? Really, I have no idea.\u201d</p>    <p>Last year, Matafeo \u201cgot a lot of shit\u201d for saying she regrets making a romcom. But it came from \u201cintense self-reflection about what romance is\u201d, she says. \u201cEvery other type of love is as important, if not more important. You start to realise: you can be romantic about everything. It\u2019s a state of mind.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s easier for musicians, she says, who can make album after album about heartbreak. \u201cWhen you\u2019re exploring those things in standup, there\u2019s no backing track. It feels much more real and vulnerable and quite pathetic. But it\u2019s one of the massive themes of life that every form of art comes back to.\u201d</p> <p>She is braced for controversy again \u2013 Taylor Swift is the subject of some very funny, very cutting jokes in On and On and On. Does Matafeo fear the singer\u2019s notorious fandom? \u201cGod yeah, 100 per cent. I will be hunted down for saying this,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I cannot be scared to speak my truth.\u201d</p> <p>Matafeo grew up in Auckland. Her Samoan dad and Scottish-Croatian mum were creative and encouraging, taking her to \u201cgalleries and libraries, every free thing we could do\u201d. Aged 11 she auditioned for a kids\u2019 show called Sticky TV, and was recruited to be one of a number of mini agony aunts and uncles. \u201cIt was bad advice,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was fun, and I became very comfortable in front of the camera.\u201d</p> <p>Two decades later, Matafeo is returning to children\u2019s television. She is the new host of <a href=\"https://taskmaster.info/show.php?id=15\">Junior Taskmaster</a>, a spin-off of Channel 4\u2019s comedy gameshow. Matafeo takes on the Greg Davies role, sitting in judgment of the young contestants, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/mar/19/mike-wozniak-funniest-things\">Mike Wozniak</a> as her sidekick. \u201cWe\u2019re the kooky auntie and uncle to these children,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got more of a teacher vibe than I thought I would.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kids on Junior Taskmaster would try to shake me down for points at the side of the stage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The tasks are just as tough as in the original show: \u201cAdults would struggle. I loved watching what they did.\u201d After Sticky TV, she can empathise with the junior contestants. \u201cThose live recordings are so scary. But they really opened up.\u201d So much so that Matafeo received a fair bit of banter from her young colleagues. \u201cSome of them would try and shake me down for points side of stage.\u201d</p> <p>I suggest Matafeo has had the dream career trajectory, from kids\u2019 TV to standup star to writer-director. \u201cWhen you put it that way, yeah, I\u2019ve been so lucky. Directing on Starstruck and writing stuff: when I was 11, that\u2019s what I wanted to do. It\u2019s been amazing to have picked up all this other stuff along the way,\u201d she says. \u201cThe difficulty becomes: where do I want to spend my time and energy?\u201d</p> <p>She has said in the past that she fears an empty schedule. With so many creative doors ajar, she is ready to stop and think about what to do next. As she told us in Horndog, she gives 100 per cent to the stuff she cares about. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m going to win an Oscar!\u2019 Now it becomes much more about trying to build a day-to-day life where I feel good, I feel fulfilled,\u201d she says. \u201cDo as much good as you can, and maybe have a lovely cake from time to time.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 On and On and On is at the <a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/rose-matafeo-on-and-on-and-on/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwpbi4BhByEiwAMC8JnTVK1_Mkw8my00eYWPqeZdm48nPbJzba_GVUKYYLorvFKfwaufSRCRoCLssQAvD_BwE\">Arcola theatre, London</a>, until 19 October; then at the Britten theatre, London, on 26 October.

It\u2019s a state of mind.\u201d It\u2019s easier for musicians, she says, who can make album after album about heartbreak. \u201cWhen you\u2019re exploring those things in standup, there\u2019s no backing track. It feels much more real and vulnerable and quite pathetic. But it\u2019s one of the massive themes of life that every form of art comes back to.\u201d She is braced for controversy again \u2013 Taylor Swift is the subject of some very funny, very cutting jokes in On and On and On. Does Matafeo fear the singer\u2019s notorious fandom? \u201cGod yeah, 100 per cent. I will be hunted down for saying this,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I cannot be scared to speak my truth.\u201d Matafeo grew up in Auckland. Her Samoan dad and Scottish-Croatian mum were creative and encouraging, taking her to \u201cgalleries and libraries, every free thing we could do\u201d. Aged 11 she auditioned for a kids\u2019 show called Sticky TV, and was recruited to be one of a number of mini agony aunts and uncles. \u201cIt was bad advice,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was fun, and I became very comfortable in front of the camera.\u201d Two decades later, Matafeo is returning to children\u2019s television. She is the new host of Junior Taskmaster, a spin-off of Channel 4\u2019s comedy gameshow. Matafeo takes on the Greg Davies role, sitting in judgment of the young contestants, with Mike Wozniak as her sidekick. \u201cWe\u2019re the kooky auntie and uncle to these children,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got more of a teacher vibe than I thought I would.\u201d The tasks are just as tough as in the original show: \u201cAdults would struggle. I loved watching what they did.\u201d After Sticky TV, she can empathise with the junior contestants. \u201cThose live recordings are so scary. But they really opened up.\u201d So much so that Matafeo received a fair bit of banter from her young colleagues. \u201cSome of them would try and shake me down for points side of stage.\u201d I suggest Matafeo has had the dream career trajectory, from kids\u2019 TV to standup star to writer-director. \u201cWhen you put it that way, yeah, I\u2019ve been so lucky. Directing on Starstruck and writing stuff: when I was 11, that\u2019s what I wanted to do. It\u2019s been amazing to have picked up all this other stuff along the way,\u201d she says. \u201cThe difficulty becomes: where do I want to spend my time and energy?\u201d She has said in the past that she fears an empty schedule. With so many creative doors ajar, she is ready to stop and think about what to do next. As she told us in Horndog, she gives 100 per cent to the stuff she cares about. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m going to win an Oscar!\u2019 Now it becomes much more about trying to build a day-to-day life where I feel good, I feel fulfilled,\u201d she says. \u201cDo as much good as you can, and maybe have a lovely cake from time to time.\u201d \u2022 On and On and On is at the Arcola theatre, London, until 19 October; then at the Britten theatre, London, on 26 October. Junior Taskmaster begins on Channel 4 in November",

      "body": "<p>Sometimes, truth really is stranger than fiction \u2013 even when the fiction is the overwrought drama and bizarre medical mysteries of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/26/greys-anatomy-the-tv-show-that-has-always-been-there-for-me\">Grey\u2019s Anatomy</a>. For seven years, Elisabeth Finch, a TV writer with credits on True Blood and The Vampire Diaries, helped craft the credulity-straining and tearjerking plotlines on the long-running ABC medical soap, with a particular knack for bringing the show into the social media zeitgeist via personal experience. \u201cFinchie\u201d, as she was known in the writers\u2019 room, penned episodes on chondrosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer she developed in 2012 (and wrote about in essays for Elle, among others); about needing an abortion during cancer treatment (also outlined in a video for NowThis); about sexual assault, which she said happened to her on the Vampire Diaries set (another essay, for the Hollywood Reporter, during the height of #MeToo).</p> <p>Finch\u2019s penchant for spinning personal trauma into television gold brought industry acclaim, social media clout and a close personal relationship with Grey\u2019s creator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shonda-rhimes\">Shonda Rhimes</a> \u2013 and, seemingly, ever more tragedy. In 2018, Finch abruptly left work to attend to a friend killed in the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh; according to Jewish tradition, she told her colleagues and social media followers, she helped clean his remains off the floor. A year later, she disappeared from work again to pull the plug on her brother\u2019s life support after his suicide attempt \u2013 a final act of abusive vindictiveness, she said. And then, in May 2022, the biggest shock of all: a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/05/greys-anatomy-elisabeth-finch-truth-lies\">two-part</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/05/greys-anatomy-elisabeth-finch-jennifer-beyer\">investigation</a> by the Vanity Fair journalist Evgenia Peretz that undid all of Finch\u2019s stories. The articles, now adapted into the Peacock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/documentary\">docuseries</a> Anatomy of Lies, portrayed Finch as a prolific fabulist mining others\u2019 kindness for attention, sympathy and clout. \u201cShe befriended people who are very empathetic, and preyed upon that empathy,\u201d Peretz told the Guardian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/20/hbo-chimp-crazy-documentary\">\u2018I love these chimps more than my kids\u2019: inside the wild world of \u2018monkey moms\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The three-part docuseries unravels an extensive web of deception as hair-raising and brazen as anything on Grey\u2019s Anatomy \u2013 and much of it <em>was</em> already on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, either invented by Finch or adapted from someone else\u2019s personal history. As the series underscores via documentation and interviews with several of her friends and former colleagues,<strong> </strong>Finch never had cancer. She didn\u2019t know anyone at the Tree of Life synagogue, nor did she help in the aftermath of the shooting. Her brother did not die by suicide; in fact, he was a practicing doctor in Florida. The chemo hair loss, the vomiting in the bathroom at work, the port scar she sported on set, the abortion, the stories of beloved doctors at the Mayo Clinic \u2013 all fake, and all uncannily effective at amassing power in Hollywood; Finch exited Grey\u2019s Anatomy as a co-producer on a whopping 172 episodes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kylcBO9u_c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5kylcBO9u_c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>At the time, unbeknown to her Grey\u2019s Anatomy colleagues, Finch was involved in a nasty custody dispute with the woman who finally discovered and outed her lies \u2013 her ex-wife, Jennifer Beyer, a registered nurse from Topeka, Kansas. It was Beyer who alerted Rhimes and Grey\u2019s executive producer Krista Vernoff \u2013 another friend of Finch\u2019s \u2013 about the cancer lie. And it was Beyer who principally outlined Finch\u2019s alleged emotional manipulation \u2013 more than one person in Anatomy of Lies refers to her as a \u201ctrauma vampire\u201d \u2013 in Peretz\u2019s investigation.</p> <p>After publication, Shondaland and parent company Disney put Finch on administrative leave, and she eventually left the show. But \u201cthere was a deeper emotional story to tell\u201d, said Peretz, a co-director on the series with documentarian David Schisgall. \u201cWhen the piece came out, there were a lot of people on the fence,\u201d said Schisgall. Afterwards, \u201cthere were a lot more people who were willing to talk about it.\u201d Still, both Schisgall and Peretz said it was difficult to get people to participate in the series. \u201cA lot of people look at Elizabeth Finch, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m scared of this person, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re capable of because this person is not who I thought they were,\u2019\u201d said Peretz. \u201cIt took a lot for people to rise above that fear.\u201d</p> <p>Rhimes, Vernoff and other Shondaland representatives declined to participate in the series. But several Grey\u2019s colleagues, including Andy Reaser, Kiley Donovan and Mark Wilding, explain how they believed Finch\u2019s deceptions over years \u2013 partly out of deference to Beyer, whom Finch branded as mentally unstable and a liar, and her five children, whom Finch co-parented for a period of time. The two first met at an in-patient psychiatric facility in Arizona in 2019. Beyer was reeling from alleged physical and emotional abuse by her ex-husband, recovering from a dissociative episode and fighting to regain custody of her kids. Finch \u2013 checked in as \u201cJo\u201d, the name of her preferred Grey\u2019s character \u2013 told her co-workers she needed time to heal from the loss of her friend at the Tree of Life synagogue, and told Beyer that she had PTSD from actually witnessing the shooting.</p> <p>Beyer, as the series\u2019 chief witness, along with her two oldest children, Maya and Van, warmly recounts how Finch barreled into her life, seeming to mirror her pain. Beyer was being harassed by her ex-husband; Finch said her brother, Eric, had long abused her and was threatening her. Shortly after Beyer\u2019s release, her ex-husband killed himself, throwing a new wrench into her custody struggle. Finch, who falsely told her co-workers that the suicide was her brother\u2019s, flew out to Kansas to be with Beyer, precipitating a virtual takeover of Beyer\u2019s life \u2013 her friends, her kids, even her therapist.</p>    <p>When Peretz first met Beyer, in 2022, she was shattered from Finch\u2019s serial lies and threats to take custody of her children. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t make eye contact. She was extremely fragile. She wasn\u2019t sure that people were going to believe her. A lot of people in her world still didn\u2019t believe her,\u201d said Peretz. But Beyers had meticulously documented her days with Finch via photo and video, a habit developed via earlier custody battles. The evidence, along with her own testimony, proved cathartic. \u201cShe\u2019s now in a very strong place,\u201d said Peretz. \u201cAnd watching and being a small part of that transformation was definitely the most gratifying part of this making this show.\u201d</p> <p>As with the initial articles, Finch declined to participate. Her only statement on the matter remains a December 2022 interview with Hollywood newsletter <a href=\"https://theankler.com/p/the-greys-anatomy-liar-confesses\">the Ankler</a>, titled \u201cThe \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Liar Confesses it All\u201d in which she admitted lying about cancer (though, as Peretz noted, \u201cit\u2019s not really a confessional if you\u2019ve already been caught\u201d). Finch framed her lies as a maladaptive coping mechanism to childhood abuse at the hands of her brother, for which she offered no evidence. (Finch\u2019s parents and brother have declined all media requests; according to Peretz, \u201cas far as our reporting went, there was no trauma from childhood that would have explained this.\u201d) And she pitched herself as a writer who was \u201cgoing to work my fucking ass off because this is where I want to be and I know what it\u2019s like to lose everything\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very clear to me that she did this interview just to get back into Hollywood and to spin a new story,\u201d said Peretz. The series otherwise avoids trying to pathologize or diagnose the psychology of this specific fabulist. \u201cWe were very cognizant of the fact that we\u2019re not doctors, we didn\u2019t meet her,\u201d said Peretz. Whether for love, attention, power, validation or a particularly cutthroat version of the righteous victim posturing many assume on social media, the damage is the same \u2013 and for some, like Beyer, healed through sharing her side of the story.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people are betrayed by people they think they love and who love them,\u201d said Schisgall, noting the shame around feeling conned, particularly through one\u2019s generosity. The hope for the series, he added, is that those preyed on for their empathy \u201cfeel seen by seeing these other people who\u2019ve been through it, and who are processing it\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Anatomy of Lies is now available on Peacock in the US with a UK date to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

For seven years, Elisabeth Finch, a TV writer with credits on True Blood and The Vampire Diaries, helped craft the credulity-straining and tearjerking plotlines on the long-running ABC medical soap, with a particular knack for bringing the show into the social media zeitgeist via personal experience. \u201cFinchie\u201d, as she was known in the writers\u2019 room, penned episodes on chondrosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer she developed in 2012 (and wrote about in essays for Elle, among others); about needing an abortion during cancer treatment (also outlined in a video for NowThis); about sexual assault, which she said happened to her on the Vampire Diaries set (another essay, for the Hollywood Reporter, during the height of #MeToo). Finch\u2019s penchant for spinning personal trauma into television gold brought industry acclaim, social media clout and a close personal relationship with Grey\u2019s creator, Shonda Rhimes \u2013 and, seemingly, ever more tragedy. In 2018, Finch abruptly left work to attend to a friend killed in the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh; according to Jewish tradition, she told her colleagues and social media followers, she helped clean his remains off the floor. A year later, she disappeared from work again to pull the plug on her brother\u2019s life support after his suicide attempt \u2013 a final act of abusive vindictiveness, she said. And then, in May 2022, the biggest shock of all: a two-part investigation by the Vanity Fair journalist Evgenia Peretz that undid all of Finch\u2019s stories. The articles, now adapted into the Peacock docuseries Anatomy of Lies, portrayed Finch as a prolific fabulist mining others\u2019 kindness for attention, sympathy and clout. \u201cShe befriended people who are very empathetic, and preyed upon that empathy,\u201d Peretz told the Guardian. The three-part docuseries unravels an extensive web of deception as hair-raising and brazen as anything on Grey\u2019s Anatomy \u2013 and much of it was already on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, either invented by Finch or adapted from someone else\u2019s personal history. As the series underscores via documentation and interviews with several of her friends and former colleagues, Finch never had cancer. She didn\u2019t know anyone at the Tree of Life synagogue, nor did she help in the aftermath of the shooting. Her brother did not die by suicide; in fact, he was a practicing doctor in Florida. The chemo hair loss, the vomiting in the bathroom at work, the port scar she sported on set, the abortion, the stories of beloved doctors at the Mayo Clinic \u2013 all fake, and all uncannily effective at amassing power in Hollywood; Finch exited Grey\u2019s Anatomy as a co-producer on a whopping 172 episodes. At the time, unbeknown to her Grey\u2019s Anatomy colleagues, Finch was involved in a nasty custody dispute with the woman who finally discovered and outed her lies \u2013 her ex-wife, Jennifer Beyer, a registered nurse from Topeka, Kansas. It was Beyer who alerted Rhimes and Grey\u2019s executive producer Krista Vernoff \u2013 another friend of Finch\u2019s \u2013 about the cancer lie. And it was Beyer who principally outlined Finch\u2019s alleged emotional manipulation \u2013 more than one person in Anatomy of Lies refers to her as a \u201ctrauma vampire\u201d \u2013 in Peretz\u2019s investigation. After publication, Shondaland and parent company Disney put Finch on administrative leave, and she eventually left the show. But \u201cthere was a deeper emotional story to tell\u201d, said Peretz, a co-director on the series with documentarian David Schisgall. \u201cWhen the piece came out, there were a lot of people on the fence,\u201d said Schisgall. Afterwards, \u201cthere were a lot more people who were willing to talk about it.\u201d Still, both Schisgall and Peretz said it was difficult to get people to participate in the series. \u201cA lot of people look at Elizabeth Finch, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m scared of this person, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re capable of because this person is not who I thought they were,\u2019\u201d said Peretz. \u201cIt took a lot for people to rise above that fear.\u201d Rhimes, Vernoff and other Shondaland representatives declined to participate in the series. But several Grey\u2019s colleagues, including Andy Reaser, Kiley Donovan and Mark Wilding, explain how they believed Finch\u2019s deceptions over years \u2013 partly out of deference to Beyer, whom Finch branded as mentally unstable and a liar, and her five children, whom Finch co-parented for a period of time. The two first met at an in-patient psychiatric facility in Arizona in 2019. Beyer was reeling from alleged physical and emotional abuse by her ex-husband, recovering from a dissociative episode and fighting to regain custody of her kids. Finch \u2013 checked in as \u201cJo\u201d, the name of her preferred Grey\u2019s character \u2013 told her co-workers she needed time to heal from the loss of her friend at the Tree of Life synagogue, and told Beyer that she had PTSD from actually witnessing the shooting. Beyer, as the series\u2019 chief witness, along with her two oldest children, Maya and Van, warmly recounts how Finch barreled into her life, seeming to mirror her pain. Beyer was being harassed by her ex-husband; Finch said her brother, Eric, had long abused her and was threatening her. Shortly after Beyer\u2019s release, her ex-husband killed himself, throwing a new wrench into her custody struggle. Finch, who falsely told her co-workers that the suicide was her brother\u2019s, flew out to Kansas to be with Beyer, precipitating a virtual takeover of Beyer\u2019s life \u2013 her friends, her kids, even her therapist. When Peretz first met Beyer, in 2022, she was shattered from Finch\u2019s serial lies and threats to take custody of her children. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t make eye contact. She was extremely fragile. She wasn\u2019t sure that people were going to believe her. A lot of people in her world still didn\u2019t believe her,\u201d said Peretz. But Beyers had meticulously documented her days with Finch via photo and video, a habit developed via earlier custody battles. The evidence, along with her own testimony, proved cathartic. \u201cShe\u2019s now in a very strong place,\u201d said Peretz. \u201cAnd watching and being a small part of that transformation was definitely the most gratifying part of this making this show.\u201d As with the initial articles, Finch declined to participate. Her only statement on the matter remains a December 2022 interview with Hollywood newsletter the Ankler, titled \u201cThe \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Liar Confesses it All\u201d in which she admitted lying about cancer (though, as Peretz noted, \u201cit\u2019s not really a confessional if you\u2019ve already been caught\u201d). Finch framed her lies as a maladaptive coping mechanism to childhood abuse at the hands of her brother, for which she offered no evidence. (Finch\u2019s parents and brother have declined all media requests; according to Peretz, \u201cas far as our reporting went, there was no trauma from childhood that would have explained this.\u201d) And she pitched herself as a writer who was \u201cgoing to work my fucking ass off because this is where I want to be and I know what it\u2019s like to lose everything\u201d. \u201cIt was very clear to me that she did this interview just to get back into Hollywood and to spin a new story,\u201d said Peretz. The series otherwise avoids trying to pathologize or diagnose the psychology of this specific fabulist. \u201cWe were very cognizant of the fact that we\u2019re not doctors, we didn\u2019t meet her,\u201d said Peretz. Whether for love, attention, power, validation or a particularly cutthroat version of the righteous victim posturing many assume on social media, the damage is the same \u2013 and for some, like Beyer, healed through sharing her side of the story. \u201cA lot of people are betrayed by people they think they love and who love them,\u201d said Schisgall, noting the shame around feeling conned, particularly through one\u2019s generosity. The hope for the series, he added, is that those preyed on for their empathy \u201cfeel seen by seeing these other people who\u2019ve been through it, and who are processing it\u201d. Anatomy of Lies is now available on Peacock in the US with a UK date to be announced",

The Carsley project had seemed a convenient way to mask the dearth of available homegrown options \u2013 there are four English managers in the Premier League, and three of them are currently in the bottom five.

First up, reports emerged that Pep Guardiola was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/14/pep-guardiola-england-job-fa-lee-carsley\">contacted by the FA over the summer</a> to sound out his interest, and did not just laugh until the line went dead. It\u2019s hard to imagine why, even amid Manchester City\u2019s current uncertainties, Guardiola would accept a rapid reduction in pay and trophies, in exchange for a sharp rise in tedious press conferences and general hassle. Perhaps FA suits had hoped Pep might be seduced by the England job\u2019s historical impossibility, like an ancient unsolved puzzle carved on a monolith. But things move fast in the white heat and noise of an international break, and by Tuesday morning, the FA had moved on to another tactical doyen with his prints on Big Cup: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/15/thomas-tuchel-advanced-talks-england-manager\">Tommy T</a>!</p> <p>Having left Bayern Munich at the end of last season, Thomas Tuchel is available and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/15/thomas-tuchel-advanced-talks-england-manager\">now in</a> advanced talks to take the reins from an ashen, trembling Carsley.

      "body": "<p>On the club circuit in the 1960s, there was an unwritten rule about keyboards. The stages in most clubs were tiny, so whichever band was headlining got their choice of keyboard on stage first. If you were the support act \u2013 if, say, you were Reg Dwight, the keyboard player in a hard-working but minor band called Bluesology \u2013 you had to use whatever instrument the headliner used, because there was no room to set up your own gear.</p> <p>My nightmare, which regularly came true, was arriving at the venue to find a Hammond organ on stage. The Hammond was an enormous, intimidating thing, like a chest of drawers with a keyboard attached. It had foot pedals and drawbars that changed its tone, and a huge speaker with a fan in front of it called a Leslie cabinet, which gave you a vibrato effect. I didn\u2019t know how to work any of it. It felt like being at the controls of a spacecraft: a spacecraft that I had absolutely no idea how to fly.</p> <p>I started thinking about the Hammond organ the other day, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/13/zoot-money-obituary\">Zoot Money died</a>. He was one of those people who knew exactly what to do with it, who could make it growl and soar and sing. His death didn\u2019t pass unnoticed but the coverage didn\u2019t really reflect what a big deal Zoot Money\u2019s Big Roll Band were in the 60s. They were a huge draw in the clubs: mods loved them. After he died, I listened to their version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV64tLNYHTw\">The Cat</a>, an old soul-jazz instrumental by Jimmy Smith that was a real standard on the club scene at the time: everyone played it, Bluesology included. We did it so often that, without thinking, I started miming along to it, playing the melody line with my right hand on the dining table. It must be nearly 60 years since I performed that song live, and I still remembered how to play it. But I couldn\u2019t play it the way Zoot Money did, then or now. He was something special.</p>    <p>The club scene in Britain back then was full of special keyboard players \u2013 but Steve Winwood aside, none of them are really household names these days. It\u2019s funny: there\u2019s still a lot of reverence for the guitar heroes that British rock produced in the 60s \u2013 Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page \u2013 but the keyboard heroes, <em>my</em> heroes, not so much. I think that\u2019s unfair \u2013 these were incredible, innovative musicians.</p> <p>The first two I noticed were on stage at the Harrow Weald Social Club, which was quite the hot local venue when I was a teenager. Most of the bands I saw there were guitar based \u2013 the Big Three, the Merseybeats, the Kinks, Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers \u2013 but the Animals\u2019 Alan Price and Gary Brooker from the Paramounts were integral to their bands\u2019 sound. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off them. Gary Brooker was playing an electric piano, something I\u2019d never seen before, and Alan Price was hunched over a Vox Continental organ, getting the most incredible sounds out of it. When you heard him play that solo on House of the Rising Sun live, you really knew about it.</p> <p>After that, I realised incredible keyboard players were everywhere: not just Zoot Money but Georgie Fame, Brian Auger, Graham Bond, Rod Argent. They were all doing something different with the keyboards; each of them had their own personality. Zoot Money was fun, a great showman: if you went to see the Big Roll Band at Klooks Kleek in West Hampstead, you knew you were in for a party. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuKi92mF2_E\">Georgie Fame</a> was the epitome of cool: influenced by Mose Allison, hip to ska when its British audience was still largely confined to the West Indian community, always in a super-sharp Ivy League suit. Blossom Dearie even wrote a song about him: \u201cPop songs I hear with suspicion [\u2026] yet I\u2019m impressed, my ears are blessed with Georgie Fame\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3nRtYBGAH8rm5MJdyCNLNt?si=dcZV8JVAR7mFRtaEq7dhWg\">  <iframe height=\"352\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3nRtYBGAH8rm5MJdyCNLNt?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Graham Bond was the musician\u2019s musician, more in a jazz vein, technically incredible, with an insane band \u2013 a supergroup before anyone knew what a supergroup was. The rhythm section was Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, who went on to form Cream; the guitarist was John McLaughlin, who subsequently played with Miles Davis. Rod Argent was the engine room of the Zombies. He wrote She\u2019s Not There and his playing takes it to another level. It\u2019s very English-sounding, very reserved and melancholy, then out of nowhere he plays this incredible solo that\u2019s soulful but slightly classically influenced. It both fits the song perfectly and takes it somewhere else.</p> <p>Brian Auger was just astonishing. His band <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SGbjzSXy7I\">Steampacket</a>, with Julie Driscoll and Rod Stewart on vocals, backed Long John Baldry until they broke up and Bluesology got the gig. I remember thinking: \u201cOh God, what a step down for John \u2013 he had Brian Auger, now he\u2019s got me.\u201d And there was Stevie Winwood, who most people think of these days as a singer-songwriter \u2013 and fair enough, he\u2019s a great songwriter \u2013 but who was like a Hammond-playing prodigy in the 60s: listen to his playing on the Spencer Davis Group\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5cTP8BHhvs\">Gimme Some Lovin\u2019</a>, which Charlie Watts once told me had the greatest intro to a record ever. Stevie was still a teenager when he did that.</p>    <p>I can understand why Steve Winwood was the only one to reach household-name status. For one thing, playing the keyboard is never as cool as playing the guitar. You can be a showman playing keyboards (Don Shinn, who played with the Soul Agents, used to rock his Hammond organ back and forth and jam screwdrivers into the keyboard: he was a huge influence on Keith Emerson\u2019s performance style) but you can\u2019t move around the stage, you\u2019re off somewhere at the side, not out front. Ian Stewart is the ultimate example of that: a brilliant player, an integral part of the Rolling Stones\u2019 sound \u2013 you can hear how great he was on Honky Tonk Women or Brown Sugar \u2013 but he played in the wings, not in front of the audience. Neither he nor his keyboard were deemed sexy enough for the Rolling Stones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/08/brian-auger-awesome-pedigree\">\u2018Clapton turned incredibly pale when Jimi began to play\u2019: Brian Auger, the Swinging 60s\u2019 pop Zelig</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And a lot of them were live artists first and recording artists second.

Gary Brooker left the Paramounts, abandoned his electric piano, formed Procol Harum and made A Whiter Shade of Pale, a record that sounded like nothing anyone had heard before. In the Small Faces, Ian McLagan changed and adapted a rhythm and blues style of playing until it perfectly fitted the psychedelic era: it\u2019s him that\u2019s really driving Itchycoo Park or the title track of Ogdens\u2019 Nut Gone Flake.

      "bodyText": "The Gomorrah author Roberto Saviano will appear at the Frankfurt book fair this week despite being snubbed by the organisers of the official Italian delegation, setting the scene for a clash between the country\u2019s far-right government and its most prominent writers. Saviano, one of Italy\u2019s bestselling living writers and an ardent critic of the far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, was absent from the initial lineup of 100 authors representing Italy, this year\u2019s guest of honour, when it was announced in May. The delegation organiser, Mauro Mazza, a conservative journalist, said the non-inclusion was not so much a question of discrimination as of giving other writers a moment in the limelight. But 41 authors who signed a letter of protest in June said Saviano\u2019s exclusion followed a pattern whereby the government was projecting a consensual image to the rest of the world while cracking down on artistic freedom at home, \u201cthrough more or less explicit forms of censorship\u201d. Several other prominent Italian authors, such as Paolo Giordano and Antonio Scurati, subsequently cancelled their appearance or declined to represent their country at Frankfurt in an official capacity. At the book fair, which runs from 16-20 October, a guest country or region is invited every year to showcase its culture, and given a free hand to curate a series of readings and panel debates. Italy is this year\u2019s guest of honour for the first time since the scheme\u2019s inaugural year in 1988. The theme of the Italian programme is \u201cRooted in the Future\u201d, with panel discussions on relatively apolitical subjects such as \u201cThe Scent of Flowers and Kisses\u201d. When Italy\u2019s culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, cuts a ribbon to formally open the Italian stand on Wednesday, however, some of the most vocal critics of his government\u2019s policies will appear at parallel events. Giordano, Scurati and Francesca Melandri will speak on a concurrent panel organised by PEN Berlin called \u201cRooted in the Present\u201d, while Saviano will speak on stage on Friday and Saturday. The anti-mafia author was sued in 2023 for calling Meloni \u201ca bastard\u201d over her immigration policies and subsequently fined \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3865). \u201cRoberto Saviano is the most famous Italian writer in the world,\u201d the Austrian author and PEN Berlin spokesperson, Eva Menasse, said. \u201cBy not inviting him to the Frankfurt book fair the Italian government has only managed to put a brighter spotlight on its illiberal practices.\u201d In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica on Tuesday, Saviano said he was travelling to Frankfurt after being personally invited by the fair\u2019s director, J\u00fcrgen Boos. \u201cI don\u2019t think my presence in Frankfurt is a victory but a form of resistance,\u201d the author said. \u201cThe book fair has activated a democratic reflex.\u201d The Frankfurt book fair is no stranger to controversies.

      "bodyText": "Over the past year, Israel has launched attacks on multiple countries and occupied territories: the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran. Yet countries and territories aside, Israel has also targeted one specific organization with a series of unprecedented rhetorical and violent attacks. Yes, the United Nations. We have all witnessed Israel, in effect, declare war on the UN. Consider the record of recent weeks and months: Israel\u2019s prime minister, while standing on stage at the UN general assembly, denounced the body as \u201ccontemptible\u201d, a \u201chouse of darkness\u201d and a \u201cswamp of antisemitic bile\u201d. Israel\u2019s outgoing ambassador to the UN shredded a copy of the UN charter with a miniature paper shredder while also standing at the podium of the general assembly, and later said the UN headquarters in New York \u201cshould be closed and wiped off the face of the Earth\u201d. Israel\u2019s foreign minister falsely accused the UN secretary general of not having condemned Iran\u2019s attacks on Israel, declared him \u201cpersona non grata in Israel\u201d and announced that he had \u201cbanned him from entering the country\u201d. The Israeli government actively obstructed a UN-mandated commission of inquiry trying to collect evidence on the 7 October attacks. Israel\u2019s parliament is in the process of designating a longstanding UN agency, Unrwa, as a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d. The Israeli military has bombed UN schools, warehouses and refugee camps in Gaza for 12 consecutive months, and killed a record 228 UN employees in the process. \u201cBy far the highest number of our personnel killed in a single conflict or natural disaster since the creation of the United Nations,\u201d to quote the UN secretary general. The Israeli military is now also attacking UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. According to the UN, \u201cfive UN \u2018Blue Helmets\u2019 serving with UNIFIL in Lebanon have been injured as Israeli forces inflicted damage on UN positions close to the \u2018Blue Line\u2019.\u201d How is any of this OK? Acceptable? Legal? Perhaps the biggest question of all: how is Israel still allowed to remain a member of the UN? Why has it not yet been expelled from an organization that it is relentlessly and shamelessly attacking and undermining? Sure, there are other human rights abusers that remain card-carrying members of the UN \u2013 Syria, Russia and North Korea, to name but a few \u2013 but none of them have killed UN employees en masse; none of them have sent tanks to invade a UN base; none of them have \u201crefused to comply with more than two dozen UNSC resolutions\u201d. It has been more than 60 years since any country in the world dared make the UN secretary general himself \u201cpersona non grata\u201d. To be clear: it\u2019s not as if there isn\u2019t a mechanism for expelling a UN member state. Article 6 of the UN charter says: \u201cA Member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.\u201d Now some might point out that no member state has ever been expelled from the UN under Article 6.

Oh, and the two main reasons cited by the UN general assembly for suspending South Africa\u2019s membership? Its practice of apartheid against the indigenous Black population and its illegal occupation of neighboring Namibia. Sound familiar? Crucially, as Thomas Grant has written, \u201cthe move against South Africa followed no precise procedural pathway in the UN charter or existing UN practice\u201d and the UN showed how \u201can improvisatory ethos prevails, when the member states judge a matter important enough that they must act.\u201d So what is more \u201cimportant\u201d for the UN member states right now than attacks on the UN itself by a single member state?

He said: \u201cThere were other things we could do to put pressure on Netanyahu and say: \u2018Of course we respect your right to self-defence but we do want you to act within the law.\u2019\u201d In December last year Cameron announced on social media that a travel ban was being imposed against a small group of illegal settlers, saying: \u201cWe are banning those responsible for settler violence from entering the UK to make sure our country cannot be a home for people who commit these intimidating acts.\u201d In his BBC interview Cameron continued to defend the thrust of Israel\u2019s policy to eradicate the threat posed by Hamas and Hezbollah. He said: \u201cOn 7 October Israel was not just attacked in the south by Hamas but then continually with rockets by Hezbollah in the north. We all want this conflict to end but it has to end in a way that is sustainable so that it does not restart. That is why it is right to back Israel\u2019s right of self-defence. But it is not a blank cheque, it\u2019s not unconditional. We do want to see aid get through to Gaza and we do want the role of the UN in Lebanon to be respected.\u201d",

They have chosen an alternate path.\u201d</p> <p>India rejected the allegations as \u201cludicrous\u201d and claimed they were part of a political agenda by the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. As tensions between the two countries hit new lows, the two countries expelled each other\u2019s top diplomats.</p> <p>Among the allegations made by Canadian police is that Indian government agents had collaborated with a criminal syndicate run by India\u2019s powerful mob boss Bishnoi to carry out assassinations. They alleged that the south Asian community, \u201cspecifically pro-Khalistani elements\u201d, were being targeted by the Indian government.</p> <p>Bishnoi has been in prison since 2014 but is accused of overseeing one of India\u2019s largest criminal empires and has been implicated in several high-profile killings, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/baba-siddique-shooting-india-bandra-mumbai-politician\">the shooting of a politician in Mumbai</a> over the weekend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/14/canada-sikhs-india-organized-crime-hit-squads\">India, gangs \u2026 or both? Who is behind assassinations of Canadian Sikhs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat we have seen is the use of organised crime elements,\u201d said Brigitte Gauvin, a Canadian police assistant commissioner, at a press conference on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been publicly attributed to one organised crime gang in particular.

      "bodyText": "Canadian police have accused the Indian government of working with a criminal network run by one of India\u2019s most notorious gangsters, Lawrence Bishnoi, to carry out targeted killings of dissidents in Canada. A diplomatic row broke out between India and Canada on Monday after Canadian police accused Indian diplomats of \u201ccriminal\u201d activities in the country, including extortion, intimidation, coercion and harassment, and involvement in targeted killings of Canadian citizens. Canadian police said they had uncovered evidence that implicated India\u2019s top diplomat, Sanjay Verma, in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist who was gunned down outside a gurdwara in a suburb of Vancouver in June last year. Canada\u2019s foreign minister, M\u00e9lanie Joly, also tied five other expelled Indian officials to Nijjar\u2019s assassination and said Canada had gathered \u201cample, clear and concrete evidence that identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case\u201d. The US on Tuesday echoed calls for India to cooperate with Canada\u2019s investigation. \u201cWe have made clear that the allegations are extremely serious and they need to be taken seriously,\u201d US state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters. \u201cAnd we wanted to see the government of India cooperate with Canada in its investigation. \u201cObviously, they have not. They have chosen an alternate path.\u201d India rejected the allegations as \u201cludicrous\u201d and claimed they were part of a political agenda by the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. As tensions between the two countries hit new lows, the two countries expelled each other\u2019s top diplomats. Among the allegations made by Canadian police is that Indian government agents had collaborated with a criminal syndicate run by India\u2019s powerful mob boss Bishnoi to carry out assassinations. They alleged that the south Asian community, \u201cspecifically pro-Khalistani elements\u201d, were being targeted by the Indian government. Bishnoi has been in prison since 2014 but is accused of overseeing one of India\u2019s largest criminal empires and has been implicated in several high-profile killings, including the shooting of a politician in Mumbai over the weekend. \u201cWhat we have seen is the use of organised crime elements,\u201d said Brigitte Gauvin, a Canadian police assistant commissioner, at a press conference on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been publicly attributed to one organised crime gang in particular. We believe the Bishnoi group is connected to the agents of the government of India.\u201d Bishnoi\u2019s gang is said to have a growing presence in Canada, where there is a sizeable Indian Sikh diaspora. In September 2023, Bishnoi\u2019s gang claimed to be behind the killing of Sukhdool Singh Gill, who allegedly had connections to Khalistani groups and was on a wanted list by the Indian government. Gill was gunned down in the Canadian city of Winnipeg and Canadian investigators said they now believed the killing was on the instructions of Indian agents. The accusations by Canada have fuelled mounting allegations that the Indian government, under the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has orchestrated a campaign of transnational violence against those it considers to be dissidents or threats to the state. In a statement on Monday, Trudeau said: \u201cIndia has made a monumental mistake in choosing to use their diplomats and organised crime to attack Canadians.\u201d In response, unnamed Indian officials told local media that it was \u201cthe same old Trudeau saying the same old things for the same old reasons\u201d. A report in the Washington Post cited Canadian officials who claimed to have evidence that the attacks and surveillance of Sikhs in Canada had been directly authorised by Indian\u2019s home minister, Amit Shah, who is known as Modi\u2019s right-hand man. The report also claimed that the evidence of high-level Indian involvement in criminal activity in Canada had been presented to India\u2019s national security adviser, Ajit Doval, at a secret meeting over the weekend, where Doval denied any involvement in violence. Doval reportedly rebuffed allegations that India recruited the Bishnoi gang to carry out targeted killings, but did acknowledge that Bishnoi was \u201ccapable of orchestrating violence from wherever he is incarcerated\u201d. Canadian officials have accused India of refusing to cooperate with their investigation and said the Indian government had refused to waive diplomatic immunity for the six individuals implicated in the alleged violence. New Delhi has maintained that Canadian officials have yet to present any credible evidence to back up their allegations. According to reports, the US government had also been part of recent discussions with India regarding allegations of the Indian government\u2019s involvement in transnational attacks on Canadian and US soil. Last year, US investigators said they had foiled the attempted murder of the Sikh activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun by an agent working for the Indian government. India said it had formed an inquiry into the incident and this week a statement by the US state department said Indian officials were due to travel to Washington DC on Tuesday to discuss the case. Speaking on Monday night, the freshly expelled Canadian charge d\u2019affairs in New Delhi, Stewart Wheeler, told reporters: \u201cCanada has provided credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.

The US tech corporation has ordered six or seven small nuclear reactors (SMRs) from California\u2019s Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.

The British Chambers of Commerce, which mainly represents small and medium-sized businesses, is also concerned. Companies are already facing higher costs from the new government\u2019s planned employment reforms, according to Jane Gratton, its deputy director of public policy. Introducing national insurance on employer pension contributions could raise as much as \u00a317bn a year for the exchequer, while putting up regular employer national insurance by 1p would raise about \u00a38.5bn. Government figures published on Tuesday showed some signs of a weakening in Britain\u2019s jobs market, with pay growth slowing. Rob Morgan, the chief investment analyst at the wealth manager Charles Stanley, said a rise in employers\u2019 contributions could lead to wage rises being curtailed as bosses attempt to limit the impact of paying higher staff costs.

Conservatives argue that an increase in employer national insurance contributions would amount to breaking a manifesto pledge. Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England, said Reeves should ignore Labour\u2019s \u201cirresponsible\u201d manifesto pledge and raise national insurance for workers in the budget. In an article for the Independent, Lord King said it was \u201creckless\u201d for the Tories to cut national insurance before the general election, and that both main parties were \u201cirresponsible\u201d when they said they would not reverse those cuts and that it would be best for the government to put it back up.",

The shouting was often followed by a woman shouting \u201cShut the fuck up\u201d and \u201cGo to your room, you fucking bastard.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sara\u2019s father, Urfan Sharif, 42, her stepmother, Beinash Batool, 30, and her paternal uncle Faisal Malik, 29, are accused of carrying out a violent \u201ccampaign of abuse\u201d before killing her on 8 August.</p> \n<p>The court was told the defendants fled to Pakistan the following day. Sharif then called police to say he had beaten Sara \u201ctoo much\u201d as a punishment for being naughty. The taxi driver also left a note by Sara\u2019s fully clothed body, saying: \u201cI swear to God that my intention was not to kill her. But I lost it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prosecutor, William Emlyn Jones KC, told the court on Tuesday that Sara began wearing a hijab in January 2023 \u201cto conceal injuries to her face and head from the outside world\u201d. Neighbours told police it seemed \u201cunusual\u201d because Sara was the only member of her family to wear a hijab.</p> \n<p>She was withdrawn from school on 17 April 2023 and homeschooled after teachers reported seeing her with bruises on three occasions. On 10 March 2023, the second incident, Sara\u2019s teacher, Helen Simmons, asked the schoolgirl about the two distinct bruises on her chin and right eye.</p> \n<p>Emlyn Jones said: \u201cSara acted coy and tried to hide them. Miss Simmons observed that Sara would often pull her hijab to hide her face if she did not want to speak or was being told off. Sara gave multiple conflicting stories as to how she got the bruises.\u201d</p> \n<p>The teacher sought advice and it was agreed that a referral to social services was needed, the prosecutor added. The teacher noticed another bruise on 28 March and questioned Batool, who claimed it had been caused by a pen. Sara was withdrawn from school less than three weeks later.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt means from April onwards, Sara was not exposed to or seen by anyone in the outside world,\u201d Emlyn Jones said.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor detailed some of the weapons found in the house that were believed to have been used on Sara, including a makeshift plastic hood with her bloodstains on it. \u201cThese objects are homemade hoods. They had been placed over Sara\u2019s face and head and then taped in place,\u201d he told jurors, adding that Batool had bought 18 rolls of parcel tape in July alone.</p> \n<p>Jurors were shown images of the hoods, which were plastic bags wrapped in brown tape with a small hole for the mouth.</p> \n<p>Police also found a cricket bat stained with Sarah\u2019s blood, a rolling pin with her DNA, and lengths of black rope with her hair attached to it.

A regulatory filing by the company on Tuesday said it intended to raise the money through a stock and debt offering, which would provide flexibility for Boeing to seek options to support its balance sheet over a three-year period. It also entered into a separate $10bn credit agreement with a consortium of banks, which it said would provide short-term access to liquidity as it navigated through a \u201cchallenging environment\u201d. Production at the planemaker has been hobbled by the strike that began a month ago, which is estimated to have cost the company more than $1bn, according to Reuters. Last week, the company withdrew its offer of a 30% pay rise over four years for striking staff after talks with unions broke down, and later in the week it announced plans to shed 17,000 jobs \u2013 about 10% of its global workforce \u2013 to cut costs. The strikes add to a tumultuous year for Boeing, which began in January when a door panel blew out in mid-air from one of its 737 Max 9s shortly after it took off from Portland, Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) then enforced a cap on the production of the Max jets. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people, and agreed to pay a fine of almost $250m (\u00a3191m). It was not clear when or how much the company expected to raise through the offering announced on Tuesday but analysts predicted it would be completed before the end of the year. Boeing is also facing $11.5bn of debt maturing through February 2026, while it has committed to issuing $4.7bn of its shares to acquire Spirit AeroSystems, as well as take on its debt. The deal to buy back the parts supplier, which it sold off nearly 20 years ago, was part of its plan to boost safety on production lines.

It said: \u201cThese are two prudent steps to support the company\u2019s access to liquidity.\u201d",

But if you think its messages might be outdated, au contraire: like Sidney Lumet\u2019s Network (another vivisectional and scathingly cynical satire of media spectacle), the film remains strikingly relevant and scorchingly hot to the touch, told with cyclonic force and style. A sensationally smug Kirk Douglas stars as Chuck Tatum, a hotshot city reporter who arrives in a small town hoping to land a story that\u2019ll catapult him back to the big time. He marches into the news desk of a humble rag in Albuquerque, dripping bravado, bragging to the publisher about how he\u2019s been fired from 11 newspapers. It\u2019s clear this guy has burned every bridge, but we assume he\u2019s good at his job.

      "bodyText": "Climate campaigners have asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate whether \u201cfly carbon neutral\u201d and other sustainability claims by Qantas are misleading or deceptive. The greenwashing complaint, filed by the Environmental Defenders Office on behalf of research and advocacy organisation Climate Integrity, urged the competition watchdog to investigate the airline\u2019s marketing materials and the credibility of the company\u2019s transition to net zero. The complaint focused on the national carrier\u2019s \u201cfly carbon neutral\u201d product \u2013 which allows customers to check a box to offset their emissions when they buy a ticket \u2013 and its use of phrases such as \u201csustainable aviation fuel\u201d and \u201cthe vague and broad term \u2018sustainability\u2019\u201d. It follows a landmark greenwashing decision against KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in Amsterdam in March that found common aviation industry claims relating to sustainable aviation fuels, offsetting and net zero by 2050 were misleading. The district court of Amsterdam ruled the airline had misled customers with vague environmental claims and painted \u201can overly rosy picture\u201d of its sustainable aviation fuel. Last year Australia\u2019s competition watchdog signalled it would step up its probe of companies\u2019 claims about their environmental credentials after a survey of 247 businesses and brands found more than half had made misleading statements. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Climate Integrity alleged that by allowing customers to choose a \u201cfly carbon neutral\u201d option Qantas may be misleading its customers into thinking their flight is sustainable or makes no significant contribution to climate change. \u201cA Qantas customer choosing the \u2018fly carbon neutral\u2019 option for their flight might think that the climate impacts of their trip have been compensated for or significantly reduced,\u201d the director of Climate Integrity, Claire Snyder, said. \u201cBut this is not supported by science, and therefore distorts customers\u2019 perception of the sustainability of flying.\u201d The complaint claimed Qantas\u2019s repeated use of the term sustainability \u201cis incongruous with its current and likely future emissions given its long term reliance on fossil fuels\u201d. Climate Integrity said alleged greenwashing by Qantas and other airlines was especially concerning because it could encourage customers to fly more and prevented them from making informed decisions \u201ccognisant of the true emissions impacts of flying\u201d. The complaint points to bold headings on the Qantas website about the ways in which the airline was \u201cacting sustainably\u201d or \u201cdriving sustainability to protect the future of travel\u201d. It notes these claims were displayed over images of a turtle swimming on the Great Barrier Reef or a smiling young child lifted towards the sun. It urged an investigation of the credibility of the airline\u2019s plans to reach net zero by 2050, asserting Qantas had not disclosed a \u201cscience-aligned, credible methodology\u201d aligned with its commitment to the goals of the Paris climate agreement and that its emissions reductions measures were insufficient to reach its targets. Snyder said one of the \u201cbig problems\u201d with Qantas\u2019s net zero pathway was it did not engage with the issue of demand management in order to reduce emissions from the aviation sector. \u201cThat is, we need to fly less,\u201d she said. A Qantas Group spokesperson said: \u201cWe have always acknowledged that aviation is a particularly hard-to-abate sector but we have a responsibility to do what we can with what\u2019s available now.\u201d They said high integrity carbon offsets were key to the airline meeting its targets until sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and low and zero-emissions technologies were more readily available. \u201cThat\u2019s why we launched a $400m climate fund with Airbus to provide direct investments to help accelerate the establishment of a domestic SAF industry as well as high integrity nature-based solutions,\u201d they said. \u201cThe journey to net zero emissions won\u2019t be linear and one airline will not be able to solve this alone.\u201d The spokesperson said the airline\u2019s net zero target was underpinned by a robust carbon offset and sustainable aviation fuel procurement plan and \u201chaving the right partners in place to help deliver\u201d. \u201cWe have offered to work closely with Climate Integrity on this journey and have also reached out to the ACCC,\u201d they said.",

      "body": "<p> The Australian Council of Trade Unions is leading a renewed push for junior pay rates to be scrapped for adults aged between 18 and 21, in a move that could affect the livelihoods of about 500,000 young Australian workers.</p> <p>Today younger workers can earn significantly less than their older colleagues, even when they share similar responsibilities. For instance, 18-year-olds in sectors such as retail, fast food and pharmacy may earn as little as <a href=\"https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/awardsandorders/pdf/pr773884.pdf\">68% of the national minimum wage</a> of $24.10 an hour, with pay rates dwindling further for those younger. This disparity costs young Australians a staggering <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-06/unions-endorse-end-to-junior-wages/103945336\">$3.5bn in unearned wages each year</a>.</p> <p>The justification for youth wages often centres on the need for employers to provide extensive training to young, unskilled workers. The theory is that employers invest in their development and, in turn, they earn more as they gain experience. But in reality, this justification <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/theres-a-renewed-push-to-scrap-junior-rates-of-pay-for-young-adults-do-we-need-to-rethink-whats-fair-240548\">doesn\u2019t hold up</a> well any more. Many employers today expect workers to be job-ready from day one, with minimal or no training provided. In many cases, young workers <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/australias-welfare/higher-education-and-vocational-education\">invest in their own training</a> before even stepping foot into the job, making youth rates feel misplaced and outdated.</p> <p>The skills-acquisition argument might have some merit for those just entering the workforce around the minimum working age, but setting the threshold at 21 doesn\u2019t seem reasonable. In Australia, teenagers are entrusted with adult responsibilities \u2013 voting and learning to drive \u2013 by the age of 18, while they receive no discounts on essential expenses such as rent, bills or groceries. So why should they be penalised with lower pay?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/05/younger-australians-feel-they-are-losing-a-rigged-game-and-who-can-blame-them-when-the-spending-gap-is-getting-even-worse\">Younger Australians feel like the game is rigged. And with the spending gap widening, who can blame them? | Intifar Chowdhury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Junior pay rates effectively establish a continuous pool of low-cost labour for businesses looking to capitalise on the skills and enthusiasm of young workers \u2013 many of whom are simply striving to get a foothold in the workforce. </p> <p>In this context, not to mention the added pressure of the soaring cost of living, junior pay rates feel anachronistic and discriminatory.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Opponents argue that abolishing youth wages would drive up youth unemployment. Business leaders warn that employers would hesitate to hire young people at higher rates, potentially locking them out of the workforce altogether. Yet, there\u2019s <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3524034\">little to no evidence</a> to support this. New Zealand scrapped its youth wages in 2008, replacing them with a \u201cfirst job\u201d rate and a training wage set at 80% of the full award rate. Other countries, including Canada, South Korea and Belgium, have also <a href=\"https://mckellinstitute.org.au/research/articles/the-problem-with-junior-pay-rates-explained/\">eliminated or restricted in scope sub-minimum wages</a> for young people without triggering significant unemployment.</p> <p>A 2020 <a href=\"https://mckellinstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-problem-with-junior-pay-rates-explained.pdf\">analysis</a> from the McKell Institute made a similar case for Australia, suggesting that abolishing junior rates could lead to a small initial employment decline (up to 2%) or recruitment freezes but would have minimal long-term impact on youth employment. International studies, including a <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/media/422666/download\">meta-analysis</a> from the International Labour Organization reviewing 328 estimates from 15 countries between 1990 and 2015, have found that raising minimum wages typically has either a small or statistically insignificant effect on youth employment.</p> <p>So scrapping junior pay rates in Australia would probably not lead to a significant reduction in youth employment, especially if done incrementally. Moreover, it could generate economic activity and create jobs by increasing the purchasing power of young workers.</p> <p>However, business leaders argue that now is the wrong time for such changes.</p> <p>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia caution that the economy is already facing challenges, with record insolvencies and tightened consumer spending. They claim that forcing businesses to absorb the cost of higher wages could lead to job cuts and reduced hours, especially in industries such as retail and hospitality, as raising prices during a cost-of-living crisis isn\u2019t a viable option.</p> <p>It\u2019s a classic argument: businesses v workers. But this isn\u2019t about pitting the survival of small businesses against wage fairness for young people. Yes, small businesses are struggling in the current economic environment, and their challenges need attention. But conflating their plight with wage fairness for young people creates a false dilemma. You don\u2019t have to harm one to help the other. That\u2019s bad economics, and we should be able to ensure fairness without forcing such trade-offs.</p> <p>Young workers shouldn\u2019t be forced to bear the burden of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/05/younger-australians-feel-they-are-losing-a-rigged-game-and-who-can-blame-them-when-the-spending-gap-is-getting-even-worse\">intergenerational inequality</a> by losing out on wages in the early part of their working lives. Scrapping junior pay rates isn\u2019t just about fairness \u2013 it\u2019s about recognising that young people in Australia are being crushed under the weight of rising living costs, wage discrimination and an uncertain job market. Their economic future is already on shaky ground, and it\u2019s time we gave them the support they need to build a more secure foundation.</p> <ul> <li><p>Dr Intifar Chowdhury is a youth researcher and a lecturer in government at Flinders University</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Council of Trade Unions is leading a renewed push for junior pay rates to be scrapped for adults aged between 18 and 21, in a move that could affect the livelihoods of about 500,000 young Australian workers. Today younger workers can earn significantly less than their older colleagues, even when they share similar responsibilities. For instance, 18-year-olds in sectors such as retail, fast food and pharmacy may earn as little as 68% of the national minimum wage of $24.10 an hour, with pay rates dwindling further for those younger. This disparity costs young Australians a staggering $3.5bn in unearned wages each year. The justification for youth wages often centres on the need for employers to provide extensive training to young, unskilled workers. The theory is that employers invest in their development and, in turn, they earn more as they gain experience. But in reality, this justification doesn\u2019t hold up well any more. Many employers today expect workers to be job-ready from day one, with minimal or no training provided. In many cases, young workers invest in their own training before even stepping foot into the job, making youth rates feel misplaced and outdated. The skills-acquisition argument might have some merit for those just entering the workforce around the minimum working age, but setting the threshold at 21 doesn\u2019t seem reasonable. In Australia, teenagers are entrusted with adult responsibilities \u2013 voting and learning to drive \u2013 by the age of 18, while they receive no discounts on essential expenses such as rent, bills or groceries. So why should they be penalised with lower pay? Junior pay rates effectively establish a continuous pool of low-cost labour for businesses looking to capitalise on the skills and enthusiasm of young workers \u2013 many of whom are simply striving to get a foothold in the workforce. In this context, not to mention the added pressure of the soaring cost of living, junior pay rates feel anachronistic and discriminatory. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Opponents argue that abolishing youth wages would drive up youth unemployment. Business leaders warn that employers would hesitate to hire young people at higher rates, potentially locking them out of the workforce altogether. Yet, there\u2019s little to no evidence to support this. New Zealand scrapped its youth wages in 2008, replacing them with a \u201cfirst job\u201d rate and a training wage set at 80% of the full award rate. Other countries, including Canada, South Korea and Belgium, have also eliminated or restricted in scope sub-minimum wages for young people without triggering significant unemployment. A 2020 analysis from the McKell Institute made a similar case for Australia, suggesting that abolishing junior rates could lead to a small initial employment decline (up to 2%) or recruitment freezes but would have minimal long-term impact on youth employment. International studies, including a meta-analysis from the International Labour Organization reviewing 328 estimates from 15 countries between 1990 and 2015, have found that raising minimum wages typically has either a small or statistically insignificant effect on youth employment. So scrapping junior pay rates in Australia would probably not lead to a significant reduction in youth employment, especially if done incrementally. Moreover, it could generate economic activity and create jobs by increasing the purchasing power of young workers. However, business leaders argue that now is the wrong time for such changes. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia caution that the economy is already facing challenges, with record insolvencies and tightened consumer spending. They claim that forcing businesses to absorb the cost of higher wages could lead to job cuts and reduced hours, especially in industries such as retail and hospitality, as raising prices during a cost-of-living crisis isn\u2019t a viable option. It\u2019s a classic argument: businesses v workers. But this isn\u2019t about pitting the survival of small businesses against wage fairness for young people. Yes, small businesses are struggling in the current economic environment, and their challenges need attention. But conflating their plight with wage fairness for young people creates a false dilemma. You don\u2019t have to harm one to help the other. That\u2019s bad economics, and we should be able to ensure fairness without forcing such trade-offs. Young workers shouldn\u2019t be forced to bear the burden of intergenerational inequality by losing out on wages in the early part of their working lives. Scrapping junior pay rates isn\u2019t just about fairness \u2013 it\u2019s about recognising that young people in Australia are being crushed under the weight of rising living costs, wage discrimination and an uncertain job market. Their economic future is already on shaky ground, and it\u2019s time we gave them the support they need to build a more secure foundation.

It\u2019s time Australia took serious action | Adam Morton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The campaign\u2019s stated goal is to compel the federal parliament to back more policies that could accelerate the multibillion-dollar shift to a clean economy so the country can \u201ccontinue building the industries of the future and help Australia become a clean energy powerhouse\u201d.</p> \n<p>Its unstated goal is to address what some see as a vacuum in the national conversation about the climate crisis and communicate to Australians that acting fast would be an economic win across the community, not just a cost.</p> \n<p>Erwin Jackson, the investor group\u2019s director of policy, said it was \u201cthe first positive investor campaign on climate change globally\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cInvestors and investor groups globally are looking at this campaign because they essentially have the same issues that we have in Australia,\u201d he said.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>It kicks off as polling suggests voter enthusiasm for more aggressive climate action has waned amid rising household financial stress. Some surveys have identified confusion about the government\u2019s position on the climate crisis, given it has backed both a rapid growth of renewable energy and continued expansion of fossil fuel export industries.</p> \n<p>The investor group campaign is focused on what comes next: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/05/australia-2035-climate-change-target-cca-net-zero\">2035 emissions reduction target due early next year</a>, and six sectoral plans promised to explain what different parts of the economy can do to reach net zero.</p> \n<p>Its videos tell the stories of people working in clean businesses, including some who come from backgrounds in polluting industries.

You won\u2019t find many superannuation fund staff, fund managers, asset consultants or brokers with a placard on the streets or on top of a Newcastle coal train. But you may increasingly find them on a screen you\u2019re watching. Or at least their message. On Wednesday, the Investor Group on Climate Change, an organisation representing 103 members that manage the retirement savings of nearly 15 million Australians, will launch a national advertising campaign of green energy success stories under the banner \u201cclimate action pays off\u201d. The campaign\u2019s stated goal is to compel the federal parliament to back more policies that could accelerate the multibillion-dollar shift to a clean economy so the country can \u201ccontinue building the industries of the future and help Australia become a clean energy powerhouse\u201d. Its unstated goal is to address what some see as a vacuum in the national conversation about the climate crisis and communicate to Australians that acting fast would be an economic win across the community, not just a cost. Erwin Jackson, the investor group\u2019s director of policy, said it was \u201cthe first positive investor campaign on climate change globally\u201d. \u201cInvestors and investor groups globally are looking at this campaign because they essentially have the same issues that we have in Australia,\u201d he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email It kicks off as polling suggests voter enthusiasm for more aggressive climate action has waned amid rising household financial stress. Some surveys have identified confusion about the government\u2019s position on the climate crisis, given it has backed both a rapid growth of renewable energy and continued expansion of fossil fuel export industries. The investor group campaign is focused on what comes next: a 2035 emissions reduction target due early next year, and six sectoral plans promised to explain what different parts of the economy can do to reach net zero. Its videos tell the stories of people working in clean businesses, including some who come from backgrounds in polluting industries. The framework echoes previous industry campaigns deployed to prevent ambitious climate action. One video focuses on Chris, an Adelaidean who says he has \u201cgone from building fast cars\u201d for Holden to \u201cbuilding solar farms at speed\u201d and concludes: \u201cI still love the smell of petrol, I just the smell of success more.\u201d Jackson said investors had another motivation \u2013 they saw climate change as the biggest systemic risk to their assets. \u201cThey\u2019ve done their own numbers and see the costs that will come if we don\u2019t get on an orderly, planned and affordable path to net zero,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea of the campaign is to explain how this is benefiting people today and how there are transferable skills across the economy that will have a place in a net zero world. Whether you are in manufacturing, mining, engineering or a chippy, it will be better for you.\u201d Investor group member Ausbil Investment Management Limited, a boutique global fund manager, said it backed the campaign because climate change was a significant threat to the economy. \u201cAn effective policy framework is crucial,\u201d its chief executive, Mark Knight, said. \u201cWe need the federal government to stay on the path to net zero and set a strong 2035 carbon emissions target.\u201d First Sentier, a A$227bn global asset management business, said its investee companies were already directly affected by the transition to a low carbon economy and the physical impacts of climate change. \u201cIt threatens the stability of economies and societies that underpin the financial markets we operate in,\u201d its global head of responsible investment, Kate Turner, said. On Tuesday, the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announced the government would spend $5.4m on a community pilot program to help 500 households in NSW\u2019s 2515 postcode north of Wollongong run on clean electricity and appliances. The Coalition\u2019s climate change and energy spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, said gas, a fossil fuel responsible for about 20% of Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions, was \u201chere to stay\u201d. He said it would be included in the capacity investment scheme \u2013 a government underwriting scheme currently reserved for solar, wind and energy storage \u2013 if Peter Dutton became prime minister.",

      "bodyText": "It might be chump change when it comes to buying a coffee, but the surcharge on debit purchases adds up to billions of dollars a year \u2013 and it could be about to disappear. Australia\u2019s payments sector could be overhauled amid a government pledge to reform a system of fee charges that is deeply unpopular with consumers already grappling with punishing living costs. While the Albanese government has flagged its intention to ban debit card surcharges, it will also consider wider measures flowing out of a Reserve Bank review of the sector that started on Tuesday. What happens next? Why is there a sudden focus on card fees? As the Independent Payment Forum notes, debit card fees can add more than $12 to the cost of a school laptop, and $6.40 to a car service. Card payments now account for the lion\u2019s share of transactions, with about 80% of consumer payments conducted via debit, credit, prepaid and charge cards, RBA data shows. But a complicated system of opaque fees has long perplexed consumers, who might not know they are paying a surcharge until they tap their card. This disproportionately affects younger Australians, given they use cards more often than older cohorts. Shoppers have also found they are often charged the same amount for a debit or credit transaction, even though they rightly assume the latter is more expensive to process. All up, Australia\u2019s banks, payment platforms and global card companies charge $6.9bn in fees a year, according to the Independent Payments Forum, which are costs either paid by businesses or passed to customers. Transaction fees in Australia are higher than in several comparable economies such as the UK, but lower than in the US. The Biden administration is trying to combat high card charges as part of a wider campaign to tackle high consumer prices. What is the solution? While banning surcharges on debit transactions would be a relief to consumers, there are concerns businesses, especially smaller ones, will need to bear the transaction cost or raise their prices. The RBA, which has regulatory powers over the payments sector, said in its discussion paper that the average transaction fee paid by small merchants is around three times that paid by larger ones. This is because they generally cannot negotiate the same types of deals with payments networks as big businesses. The ability for the government to ban debit surcharges therefore relies on broader reforms to lower transaction costs for small businesses. \u201cThese two issues are linked as merchants would be less likely to surcharge consumers if card payment costs were lower,\u201d the RBA says. It says a debit surcharge ban may prompt payment platforms to price debit and credit card transactions differently. For consumers, this would mean debit transactions are free, and credit card payments are charged a higher rate. The measure could also stir competition among payment platforms to offer businesses more competitive rates on debit transactions, given merchants will no longer be able to pass the fees to their customers. The RBA has invited feedback on whether all card surcharges should be banned, but notes that this could drive a shift towards more credit card transactions, which would also increase transaction costs for businesses. The RBA is also considering making \u201cleast-cost routing\u201d, a policy designed to process payments via the cheapest network \u2013 usually Eftpos \u2013 a default setting for merchants\u2019 terminals, which should decrease costs. Who are the winners and losers? The government\u2019s proposed ban sparked an immediate sell-off in payments platforms, with shares in SmartPay Holdings and Tyro Payments suffering double-digit share price falls on Tuesday. The Tyro chief executive, Jon Davey, said in a statement that consumers should not pay excessive surcharges, nor should businesses fund the consumer benefits that come with high-cost cards and loyalty programs. \u201cWe support any review that assesses the true cost of card acceptance, including both debit and credit, for the fair regulation of payment acceptance in Australia,\u201d Davey said. Many payment platforms, including the US company Square, design packages for businesses that blend fees for debit and credit charges, with the costs passed to customers. This model could be disrupted by a ban on debit surcharges because it relies on subsidising credit card transactions by charging debit card users far more than the cost of the transaction. It\u2019s unclear what impact the government\u2019s proposed ban would have on the major card networks, Visa and Mastercard, which were contacted for comment. The RBA review, which is designed to increase transparency and competition in the payments sector, could fast-track a shift to alternative payment options such as \u201cpay by bank\u201d. This system is a type of direct debit which cuts card networks out of the process and should be cheaper for merchants. Australia\u2019s banking sector broadly supports a ban on debit surcharges, which means there is little opposition to the government banning the unpopular fees. \u201cThis would be a win for consumers and lead to more clarity and certainty for them,\u201d the Australian Banking Association CEO, Anna Bligh, said.",

Moody\u2019s said in a report on the water industry that it expected the companies to take the water regulator\u2019s final ruling on bill rises to the competition watchdog for reconsideration if expectations for returns on investment did not improve. Companies in England and Wales requested to spend a total of \u00a3104.5bn by raising bills by \u00a3144 over the next five years in their submissions to Ofwat\u2019s price review process, but in July the regulator provisionally only allowed them \u00a388bn, capping the increases at \u00a394. Companies formally responded the following month and Ofwat is due to make a final decision in December, although this could slip to January. Stefanie Voelz, the vice-president and senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s Ratings, said: \u201cCompanies\u2019 representations in response to the draft indicate that many are laying the ground for an appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority, if the risk and return profile is not rebalanced in their favour.\u201d Four companies challenged Ofwat\u2019s 2019 price review with the competition watchdog and successfully received a more generous allowance on the cost of capital. Since then, the state of the water industry has shot up the public agenda, with pressure from politicians, campaigners and the public for companies to spend on infrastructure to prevent leaks and sewage dumping after years of underinvestment, huge dividends and high executive pay. Companies have asked for an average return of 4.4%, while Ofwat provisionally said it would allow 3.66%. Moody\u2019s calculates the final figure could fall within a range of 3.7% to 4.1%, based on the latest market data. In the report, Moody\u2019s said the outlook for the sector remained negative. \u201cPublic, political and regulatory scrutiny remains high amid serious concerns over the companies\u2019 operational and financial performance. There is a risk that this will result in a less favourable risk-return profile that could further weaken the sector\u2019s business risk profile,\u201d Voelz said. Moody\u2019s said some companies might \u201cstruggle to attract capital for an ambitious investment programme\u201d but it could upgrade its view on a sector if either Ofwat\u2019s final decision was more generous, \u201cor management and shareholders take mitigating action to bolster credit quality\u201d. In a letter to Ofwat, the industry body Water UK has argued that the regulator\u2019s draft decisions \u201cwould likely make it impossible for the water sector to attract the level of investment that it needs\u201d. The report came as Moody\u2019s hosted an industry conference on Tuesday, attended by the bosses of Ofwat, Water UK and United Utilities at the Plaisterers\u2019 Hall in London, which was bombed in the second world war. At the event, Water UK chief executive, David Henderson, said: \u201cAs we gather here in a building that, after total devastation, was rebuilt into the splendour that we see today, let us take inspiration. \u201cWhile the water industry is not \u2013 yet \u2013 smouldering in ashes from a dropped bomb, it is certainly in a difficult place.

Thames risks falling into a government-handled administration at an awkward time for the Labour government as it attempts to position Britain as a safe haven for international investors. Business leaders from across the globe attended its investment summit in London on Monday. Thames\u2019s debt rating was slashed to the lower levels of junk by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Moody\u2019s last month. Ofwat has appointed LEK Consulting, a firm based in London and Boston, as an independent monitor to Thames, in a move first reported by Sky News. Ofwat said in August that a monitor would be enlisted. LEK will \u201creport on the progress of Thames Water against its equity raise and transformation plans\u201d, Ofwat said. An Ofwat spokesperson said it had received a \u201cdiverse range of views\u201d in response to its draft price review, and was considering the responses \u201ccarefully\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Repeated failures to prevent dead people from being abused in funeral parlours and mortuaries highlight the urgent need for regulation of funeral services in England, an inquiry has found. Sir Jonathan Michael is chairing the second phase of an inquiry into how the necrophiliac killer David Fuller was able to sexually abuse the bodies of scores of women and girls in hospital mortuaries. On Tuesday Michael published an interim report calling for urgent funeral regulation after the Hull funeral parlour scandal and growing evidence of \u201csystemic failures\u201d in protecting the dignity of the deceased. As it stands, there is nothing to stop funeral directors storing bodies in garages, the report says. Police are investigating Legacy Independent Funeral Directors in Hull after 35 bodies and suspected human ashes were recovered this year. Michael does not identify the firm by name but his report cites all the main allegations against it, including bodies being stored unrefrigerated, and unidentified remains and ashes being recovered from the premises. The report says the allegations \u201cemphasise the urgent need for independent regulation\u201d. It says that despite widespread shock and disgust at Fuller\u2019s abuse of dead women and girls, there is \u201clittle evidence of changes in practice in the sector in response\u201d to the case. It says \u201cpoor practice in the funeral sector may continue unchecked\u201d unless the government introduces regulation, including a licensing scheme and mandatory standards. Launching the report, Michael said: \u201cAnyone can set themselves up as a funeral director. They could do it from their home and keep the bodies of the deceased in their garage without anybody being able to stop them. That cannot be right. \u201cWe need a regulatory regime that will not tolerate any form of abuse or any practices that compromise the security and dignity of the deceased. The funeral directors I have met in conducting this inquiry have been caring and professional. However, sadly, there are exceptions.\u201d His interim report says: \u201cThe inquiry would expect to be informed by the government what this statutory regulatory regime will be before publication of the inquiry\u2019s final report.\u201d Other alleged incidents reported as part of the inquiry include: bodies being left to decompose; bodies being left unattended in unlocked buildings; issues with identification of the deceased; and incidents where hospitals have handed over corpses with catheters and intubation tubes still in place. The report says: \u201cThe variation in practice regarding security in the funeral sector, together with the incidence of cases of neglect we are aware of, suggests that there is a systemic failure in parts of the sector to protect the security and dignity of the deceased.\u201d It notes various calls for the funeral sector to be regulated, including by the funeral services ombudsman, and points out that regulation is being implemented in Scotland. Michael\u2019s report says: \u201cIt is clear to me that many people believe or assume that the sector is already regulated and that they are shocked to find this is not the case.\u201d Michael found that the sector was \u201can unregulated free-for-all\u201d. The report says: \u201cWe found that anyone can be a funeral director. They do not need a licence, experience, qualifications or training, and they can use whatever facilities and equipment they choose.\u201d There is no public body that can stop any abuse of the dead that falls short of criminal behaviour, the report says. \u201cThere is no organisation with specific powers to stop a funeral director from operating as such in the event of poor practice, misconduct or neglect falling short of a criminal threshold or which is not within the remit of other regulatory bodies, such as the Financial Conduct Authority or the Health and Safety Executive.\u201d According to the report, officials at the Ministry of Justice told Michael they were \u201cevaluating the effectiveness of the current oversight arrangements\u201d and awaiting the recommendations from Michael\u2019s inquiry. The National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors (SAIF) warned that regulation could increase the cost of funerals. Its chief executive, Terry Tennens, said: \u201cSAIF has proposed a phased co-regulator model that will deliver a robust inspection and standards regime based on the Scottish government\u2019s funeral director code of practice. \u201cAnd it will do this without loading excessive costs on to funeral service providers and by extension the families they serve. \u201cSAIF is ready to work constructively with the government with the aim of delivering a model of regulation that works for all and is genuinely capable of preventing a repeat of the unacceptable events in Hull earlier this year.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Hello, and welcome to TechScape. I\u2019m Blake Montgomery, technology news editor at the Guardian US. Thank you for joining me.</p> <h2>This week on my iPhone</h2>    <p><strong>Average daily notifications</strong>: 270</p> <p><strong>Apps with the most total notifications</strong>:<br>\u2013 <strong>Messages</strong>: 391<br>\u2013 <strong>New York Post</strong>: 190<br>\u2013 <strong>Slack</strong>: 121</p> <h2>Elon on the campaign trail</h2>    <p>Elon Musk is stumping hard for Donald Trump.</p> <p>The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has funded a pro-Trump political action committee with tens of millions of dollars and planned a packed campaign schedule to boost the former president in Pennsylvania. He speaks to Trump multiple times per week and has urged other billionaires to endorse the Republican candidate en masse in private gatherings, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/elon-musk-donald-trump-pennsylvania.html\">the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Taken together, Musk\u2019s actions amount to something unprecedented in modern times \u2013 a man who is both the richest in the world and owner of an influential means of mass communication throwing all his weight behind a political candidate. He is no longer a billionaire dabbling in politics. Elon Musk is a political actor here to stay.</p> <p>Last weekend, Musk appeared with Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the first assassination attempt on the former president. He\u2019s slated to make more stops in the Keystone state in the three weeks until the election, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/07/elon-musk-trump-campaigning-2024-00182706\">Politico reports</a>. He\u2019s also offering a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/07/elon-musk-pac-election-bonus-gun-rights-petition-referrals.html\">$47 referral bonus</a> for anyone who gets registered voters in any swing state to sign a petition put forward by his political action committee, America Pac. Keep in mind that Musk forced all Tesla\u2019s employees back to the office five days a week in mid-2022. One wonders how he will conduct company business with his plans to spend so much time in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>The Tesla CEO is making online contributions as well as IRL ones. He\u2019s bending Twitter/X to his political ends: he <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-149901880\">seized the handle @America</a> for America Pac this week. Last month, he stifled the circulation of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/26/jd-vance-dossier-x-klippenstein-trump-campaign\">hacked materials from the Trump campaign</a> published by an independent journalist. In Musk\u2019s own feed, it\u2019s nonstop endorsements of Trump and retweets of Trump\u2019s boosters.</p> <p>Trump seems thrilled about all of the above, sending a fundraising email with the subject line \u201cElon! Elon! Elon!\u201d and soliciting supporters to buy the black-on-black \u201cDark Maga\u201d hat that Musk wore in Pennsylvania as he jumped for joy behind Trump.</p>    <p>As the richest man in the world fights for the Republican nominee, he\u2019s taking a familiar path for Trump surrogates that go down the rabbit hole. He\u2019s making more and more appeals to the fringe wings of the Make America Great Again movement. In Pennsylvania, Musk said: \u201cThis will be the last election in America if you don\u2019t vote.\u201d It\u2019s a quip redolent of storming the Capitol. He keeps repeating the line that he\u2019ll go to prison if Kamala Harris wins.</p> <p>Trump has put forward the same sentiment, though a rosier version, remarking in July to a group of Christian supporters: \u201cIn four years, you don\u2019t have to vote again. We\u2019ll have it fixed so good, you\u2019re not going to have to vote.\u201d In a democracy-ending way, it\u2019s a hopeful thing to say. Musk\u2019s version is the negative of Trump\u2019s, full of election-denialist doom. The contrast is similar to the dynamic between Trump and JD Vance, who has offered extreme anti-abortion views in speeches and interviews while Trump himself has attempted to skirt the issue, repeating a line about handing it back to the states.</p> <p>Musk follows Trump even on matters of science, which you might think would be paramount to the CEO of technology companies. But in an <a href=\"https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1843375397024485778\">interview this week with the ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson</a>, Musk flirted with the anti-vaxx movement while pulling away from the cliff: \u201cI\u2019m not anti-vaccine in general \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t force people to take vaccines,\u201d he said, before praising the smallpox and polio vaccines. Trump himself has called the Covid shot \u201cone of the greatest achievements of mankind\u201d. During this campaign, though, he\u2019s said he will cut funding to schools with vaccine mandates and appointed Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation\u2019s most notorious anti-vaxxer, to his transition team.</p> <p>In the same conversation with Carlson, Musk repeated a remark he had earlier backed away from, wondering aloud why no one was attempting to assassinate Harris.</p> <p>Musk previously called Trump a \u201cstone-cold loser\u201d. Trump once vengefully said he could make the tech mogul \u201cbend the knee\u201d. The odd alliance has affected at least one of Musk\u2019s businesses. With his rightward shift and the release of the Hot Wheels-esque Cybertruck, Tesla has changed from being a brand coveted by Hollywood and Silicon Valley types to one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/09/irvine-california-police-cybertruck\">beloved by cops</a>. It\u2019s a transformation much like Musk\u2019s own. The value of the company is down tens of billions of dollars.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be following Musk\u2019s next steps on the campaign trail closely.</p> <h2>Art on your Samsung TV v art in a museum</h2>    <p>What is the purpose of the digital reproduction of a painting?</p> <p>Samsung announced yesterday that it had struck up a partnership to license two dozen paintings from the collection of New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) to appear in the company\u2019s Frame TVs. To promote the collaboration, the Korean electronics giant organized a tour of MoMA. We saw Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s The Starry Night, Claude Monet\u2019s enormous Water Lillies, and surrealist painter Leonora Carrington\u2019s And Then We Saw the Daughter of the Minotaur.</p>    <p>Two weeks before the announcement, the Mauritshuis Museum in the Netherlands published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/03/real-art-in-museums-stimulates-brain-much-more-than-reprints-study-finds\">study measuring the neurological effects of art</a>. Scientists found that original works of art stimulate a response in viewers\u2019 brains 10 times stronger than the one elicited by reprints of the same paintings.</p> <p>The philosopher Walter Benjamin theorized the results of the study nearly 100 years ago. In The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, published in 1937, he argued that original works possessed an ineffable aura that their replicas could never match. Samsung would seem to agree with him in inviting journalists on a private MoMA tour to see the original works. What, then, is the benefit of a piece of art on a Frame TV?</p> <p>Robin Sayetta, head of business development at MoMA, said during the tour that the partnership aligns with the museum\u2019s goal of \u201cbroadening and expanding access to modern and contemporary art\u201d. I would agree. Benjamin wrote of the reproduction of a work of art: \u201cAbove all, it enables the original to meet the beholder halfway.\u201d</p> <h2>Opt Out</h2>    <p><em>Welcome to Opt Out, a semi-regular column in which we help you navigate your online privacy and show you how to say no to surveillance.</em></p> <p>You\u2019ve got the cutest baby ever, and you want the world to know it.

This week on my iPhone Average daily notifications: 270 Apps with the most total notifications: \u2013 Messages: 391 \u2013 New York Post: 190 \u2013 Slack: 121 Elon on the campaign trail Elon Musk is stumping hard for Donald Trump. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has funded a pro-Trump political action committee with tens of millions of dollars and planned a packed campaign schedule to boost the former president in Pennsylvania. He speaks to Trump multiple times per week and has urged other billionaires to endorse the Republican candidate en masse in private gatherings, according to the New York Times. Taken together, Musk\u2019s actions amount to something unprecedented in modern times \u2013 a man who is both the richest in the world and owner of an influential means of mass communication throwing all his weight behind a political candidate. He is no longer a billionaire dabbling in politics. Elon Musk is a political actor here to stay. Last weekend, Musk appeared with Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the first assassination attempt on the former president. He\u2019s slated to make more stops in the Keystone state in the three weeks until the election, Politico reports. He\u2019s also offering a $47 referral bonus for anyone who gets registered voters in any swing state to sign a petition put forward by his political action committee, America Pac. Keep in mind that Musk forced all Tesla\u2019s employees back to the office five days a week in mid-2022. One wonders how he will conduct company business with his plans to spend so much time in Pennsylvania. The Tesla CEO is making online contributions as well as IRL ones. He\u2019s bending Twitter/X to his political ends: he seized the handle @America for America Pac this week. Last month, he stifled the circulation of hacked materials from the Trump campaign published by an independent journalist. In Musk\u2019s own feed, it\u2019s nonstop endorsements of Trump and retweets of Trump\u2019s boosters. Trump seems thrilled about all of the above, sending a fundraising email with the subject line \u201cElon! Elon! Elon!\u201d and soliciting supporters to buy the black-on-black \u201cDark Maga\u201d hat that Musk wore in Pennsylvania as he jumped for joy behind Trump. As the richest man in the world fights for the Republican nominee, he\u2019s taking a familiar path for Trump surrogates that go down the rabbit hole. He\u2019s making more and more appeals to the fringe wings of the Make America Great Again movement. In Pennsylvania, Musk said: \u201cThis will be the last election in America if you don\u2019t vote.\u201d It\u2019s a quip redolent of storming the Capitol. He keeps repeating the line that he\u2019ll go to prison if Kamala Harris wins. Trump has put forward the same sentiment, though a rosier version, remarking in July to a group of Christian supporters: \u201cIn four years, you don\u2019t have to vote again. We\u2019ll have it fixed so good, you\u2019re not going to have to vote.\u201d In a democracy-ending way, it\u2019s a hopeful thing to say. Musk\u2019s version is the negative of Trump\u2019s, full of election-denialist doom. The contrast is similar to the dynamic between Trump and JD Vance, who has offered extreme anti-abortion views in speeches and interviews while Trump himself has attempted to skirt the issue, repeating a line about handing it back to the states. Musk follows Trump even on matters of science, which you might think would be paramount to the CEO of technology companies. But in an interview this week with the ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Musk flirted with the anti-vaxx movement while pulling away from the cliff: \u201cI\u2019m not anti-vaccine in general \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t force people to take vaccines,\u201d he said, before praising the smallpox and polio vaccines. Trump himself has called the Covid shot \u201cone of the greatest achievements of mankind\u201d. During this campaign, though, he\u2019s said he will cut funding to schools with vaccine mandates and appointed Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation\u2019s most notorious anti-vaxxer, to his transition team. In the same conversation with Carlson, Musk repeated a remark he had earlier backed away from, wondering aloud why no one was attempting to assassinate Harris. Musk previously called Trump a \u201cstone-cold loser\u201d. Trump once vengefully said he could make the tech mogul \u201cbend the knee\u201d. The odd alliance has affected at least one of Musk\u2019s businesses. With his rightward shift and the release of the Hot Wheels-esque Cybertruck, Tesla has changed from being a brand coveted by Hollywood and Silicon Valley types to one beloved by cops. It\u2019s a transformation much like Musk\u2019s own. The value of the company is down tens of billions of dollars. We\u2019ll be following Musk\u2019s next steps on the campaign trail closely. Art on your Samsung TV v art in a museum What is the purpose of the digital reproduction of a painting? Samsung announced yesterday that it had struck up a partnership to license two dozen paintings from the collection of New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) to appear in the company\u2019s Frame TVs. To promote the collaboration, the Korean electronics giant organized a tour of MoMA. We saw Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s The Starry Night, Claude Monet\u2019s enormous Water Lillies, and surrealist painter Leonora Carrington\u2019s And Then We Saw the Daughter of the Minotaur. Two weeks before the announcement, the Mauritshuis Museum in the Netherlands published a study measuring the neurological effects of art. Scientists found that original works of art stimulate a response in viewers\u2019 brains 10 times stronger than the one elicited by reprints of the same paintings. The philosopher Walter Benjamin theorized the results of the study nearly 100 years ago. In The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, published in 1937, he argued that original works possessed an ineffable aura that their replicas could never match. Samsung would seem to agree with him in inviting journalists on a private MoMA tour to see the original works. What, then, is the benefit of a piece of art on a Frame TV? Robin Sayetta, head of business development at MoMA, said during the tour that the partnership aligns with the museum\u2019s goal of \u201cbroadening and expanding access to modern and contemporary art\u201d. I would agree. Benjamin wrote of the reproduction of a work of art: \u201cAbove all, it enables the original to meet the beholder halfway.\u201d Opt Out Welcome to Opt Out, a semi-regular column in which we help you navigate your online privacy and show you how to say no to surveillance.

The wider TechScape As Hurricane Milton made landfall on the heels of Hurricane Helene, a storm of misinformation followed. Google has signed a deal to buy a fleet of mini nuclear reactors \u2013 to generate the significant amounts of power required to use artificial intelligence (AI), of course.

In a comment that will alarm Brussels, Oliver Zipse told the Paris motor show the 2035 cutoff point for CO2-emitting cars was \u201cno longer realistic\u201d. The ban \u201ccould also threaten the European automotive industry in its heart,\u201d Zipse said. The measures will \u201cwith today\u2019s assumptions, lead to a massive shrinking of the industry as a whole\u201d. European car manufacturers are out in force in Paris to defend their home turf, with Chinese brands representing just one-fifth of those on show compared with 2022 when they accounted for half the brands displayed. BMW, one of the driving forces of the German car industry, is showcasing 15 electric vehicles in Paris, the most important industry event in the calendar. \u201cA correction of the 100% BEV (battery electric vehicle) target for 2035 as part of a comprehensive CO2-reduction package would also afford European OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) less reliance on China for batteries,\u201d Zipse added referring to Beijing\u2019s dominant position. Carmakers including BMW, VW and Renault, as well as the Italian government, have called for the CO2 targets to be loosened or delayed. On Monday Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of the Fiat, Citro\u00ebn and Vauxhall owner Stellantis, said proposed tariffs on Chinese cars would speed up plant closures in Europe, as they would push Beijing to move manufacturing to the continent in direct competition with European brands. Tavares said a decision would be made on the future of its UK plants \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d, amid a row over government electric vehicle quotas. Stellantis said in June that it could be forced to close its Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton if government rules were not relaxed. Tavares predicted Chinese brands would not be going to Germany, France or Italy, the home of Europe\u2019s oldest brands, but China would seek cheaper options in countries such as Hungary, where BYD is already planning an assembly plant after efforts by the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to woo investment from Beijing. This, he said, would mean \u201caccelerating the need to shut down plants\u201d elsewhere in Europe. The German car industry, once the envy of the world, is suffering partly because of weaker demand but also a slow reaction to competition from China. Efforts by BMW to push back against green targets will set alarm bells ringing in Brussels, which thought it had seen off the German car industry in 2023 when they were at loggerheads over the planned 2035 phase-out of CO2-emitting cars. Under the rules, secondhand petrol and diesel cars can be sold after this date.

      "bodyText": "Match report: Japan 1-1 Australia That\u2019s all for tonight\u2019s blog. Joey Lynch was our man in Tokyo for the game; I\u2019ll leave you with his report. \u201cPopovic will be satisfied but the game was perhaps there for the taking,\u201d says Chris Paraskevas. \u201cAt 1-0, the changes weren\u2019t quite adventurous enough and Irankunda\u2019s night on the bench betrayed a lack of ambition. \u201cIt worked tonight but might not at a World Cup.\u201d It\u2019s such a difficult balance, especially when you\u2019re 15 minutes away from such a famous victory. And it\u2019s not like there was loads of pressure before the equaliser; it came almost out of nothing. My experience as part of this team is that the boys stand up in the most difficult moment: no excuses. I\u2019m very proud of that performance \u2013 the calmness and composure that we showed in defence. It\u2019s a top foundation for us to move forward. [On the delay getting to the ground] It is what it is. When circumstances are out of your control, it makes it simple: you\u2019ve just gotta do it. I can\u2019t speak highly enough of all our stuff for the way they prepare us. They gave us the best opportunity to perform tonight and we did that. [On being captain] It\u2019s tough to put into words. I\u2019ve got a very strong emotional connection to this team and it\u2019s a very proud moment. [Starts choking up a bit] I\u2019ve got some family here which makes it even better. \u201cOver the line and a great result,\u201d says Rob Haigh. \u201cTo get anything off this machine is outstanding, well done Oz.\u201d Absolutely. In the medium term they need to be better on the ball but in the circumstances that\u2019s a terrific effort. A crimson-faced Harry Souttar looks utterly spent at the final whistle. He\u2019d be my player of the match, though you could also make a good case for Kaoru Mitoma, Jackson Irvine and Jason Geria among others. Never mind the individual stuff, that completes a very good week for Australia. Four points from six was realistically as good as it was going to get, and it sets them up for the double header against Saudi Arabia and Bahrain next month. What Australia lack in quality, they make up for in heart. That was a seriously hard-earned point, the result of an outstanding defensive performance. They didn\u2019t manage a shot on target all game but took the lead when Shogo Taniguchi sliced Lewis Miller\u2019s cross into his own net after 58 minutes. Just as Japan were getting desperate, the substitute Keito Nakamura forced an own goal from Cam Burgess. It got a bit hairy for the Socceroos after that but they held on for a terrific result. 90+6 min Ito\u2019s inswinger is claimed well by the backpedalling Gauci. For a horrible second I thought he\u2019d gone too far and was going to fall into the net, but he was fine. 90+6 min One last corner for Japan\u2026 90+5 min The free-kick leads to a brief of game of pinball before a shot from the edge of the area is smothered at source. Japan come again, Ito curls a very dangerous cross that is headed behind by the heroic Souttar. 90+4 min Burgess takes one for the team, cynically pulling back Mitoma and nodding in acceptance when the referee shows him a yellow card. The resulting free-kick might be Japan\u2019s last chance. 90+2 min Goodwin tries to run Machida, thinks he\u2019s fouled and goes over. The assistant gives a throw-in to Japan, who are ready for one last push. 90 min There will be five minutes of added time. 89 min Goodwin\u2019s first act is a high tackle on Machida that is punished with a yellow card. That means he\u2019ll miss the big match against Saudi Arabia next month. 88 min: Socceroos substitution Craig Goodwin comes on for Ajdin Hrustic. 87 min Mitoma can\u2019t quite control Tamaka\u2019s cross after another bewitching dribbled from Nakamura on the left. It was a difficult ball to take in a crowded area but Mitoma usually has such a velvet touch. 86 min Ito goes on a mazy run across the field, plays the ball to Kamada and keeps going down the left. Kamada pushes it down the line and Ito\u2019s cross is blocked. 84 min Ogawa\u2019s first touch is almost a tap in from Nakamura\u2019s cross. It\u2019s a couple of yards in front of him and Gauci sprawls to his left to grab the ball. 84 min: Japan substitution The in-form Koki Ogawa replaces Ayase Ueda up front. 83 min Here\u2019s Japan\u2019s equaliser. 82 min: Australia substitution Keanu Baccus comes on for a weary, limping Lewis Miller. 80 min Yazbek is booked for a lunging foul on Ueda. Australia aren\u2019t happy becuase they thought they should have had a free-kick moments earlier. 78 min Mitoma controls a long crossfield pass, cuts across Geria in the area and whacks a shot that hits Yazbek and flies behind. Australia looked relatively comfortable at 1-0. They do not look comfortable at 1-1. The goal was made beautifully by the substitute Keito Nakamura. He cut inside from the left, twisted Yazbek one way and then the other before sidefooting a fast low cross that was turned into his own net by Burgess. He had to play the ball with Ueda waiting behind him to score. Japan equalise through an own goal from Cam Burgess! 74 min Japan have won their last eight home games, scoring almost 40 goals in the process. Most were against inferior opposition, it\u2019s true, but this would be still be a helluva result for Australia. 73 min: Double substitution for Australia Aziz Behich and Nishan Velupillay, who scored on his debut against China, replace Jordy Bos and Mitch Duke. Poor Duke worked his socks off on the graveyard shift. 71 min Tanaka curls a long-range shot that is easily saved by Gauci. A pleasant enough strike but nowhere near the corner. 70 min: Double substitution for Japan Daichi Kamada and Keito Nakamura replace Take Kubo and Takumi Minamino. Kubo was lively enough, Minamino had a quiet night. 68 min That\u2019s Australia\u2019s best bit of interplay all night, some neat one-touch football on the edge of the Japan area. It doesn\u2019t amount to anything but maybe it\u2019s a reflection of their growing confidence. 67 min Since the goal, Japan have been treading the line between understandable impatience and unhelpful desperation. There\u2019s still a long way to go. 65 min That was the first goal Japan have conceded in qualification, after around 14 and a half hours. And that\u2019s not including all the added time. 64 min Ito\u2019s clipped cross is met by Ueda, running away from goal, and he heads straight at Gauci. For all Japan\u2019s pressure, Gauci still hasn\u2019t had a difficult save to make. 63 min: Japan substitution Junya Ito comes on for Ritsu Doan. 62 min Jordy Bos is booked for a tactical foul on the left wing. 61 min The home fans are still making a marvellous racket. If Australia win this game it\u2019ll make Muhammad Ali\u2019s rope-a-dope fight with George Foreman look like a slugfest in comparison. Lewis Miller, who has had a difficult time defensively, made a rare excursion forward and curled a dangerous cross into the middle. Taniguchi tried to clear it with his wrong foot, the right, and shinned a volley past Zion Suzuki! Australia haven\u2019t had a shot on target all game \u2013 and they\u2019re ahead! 57 min: Chance for Minamino! Kubo cuts inside from the right and curls a powerful cross towards Minamino beyond the far post. He pulls away from the defender but can\u2019t generate enough power to force his downward header on target. That was a pretty difficult chance; he\u2019d have needed Bruce Banner\u2019s neck muscles to generate the necessary power. 55 min Mitoma twists Miller\u2019s blood on the left edge of the area, only to knock the ball out of play with an accidental extra touch. He remains Japan\u2019s biggest threat, not to mention the most beautiful player to watch. 53 min Irvine makes a good interception at the near post after Kubo beats Bos stylishly on the right. Japan are starting to come to life. 52 min The danger of having the ball is that you are more susceptible to the counter-attack. Tanaka (I think) has the chance to put Mitoma through just past the halfway line but fractionally overhits his angled pass. I don\u2019t think anyone would have caught Mitoma had the weight on that pass been better. 49 min A quiet start to the second half. Australia are trying to get on the ball, as they did at the start of the game. I don\u2019t think it was a deliberate tactic to defend deeper and deeper as the first half progressed; it\u2019s more than Japan parked the bus for them and then dropped the keys down a drainhole. 46 min We go again. Well, they do; we\u2019re not really doing much. Australia have made a half-time substitution: Pat Yazbek replaces Luke Brattan, who worked very hard on his debut but didn\u2019t see much of the ball. \u201cFor all the gushing praise about the J-League and Japan\u2019s generation of Euro-stars, for me they have flattered to deceive in this game, as they so often do when required to take the initiative,\u201d writes Chris Paraskevas. \u201cMoriyasu and his never-changing suit and notepad much prefer an opponent that will allow more space to play on the counter. \u201cPopovic is calling on all of his tricks from Western Sydney\u2019s Asian Champions League run, where they faced similiar challenges: technically superior opponents, starved of the ball. \u201cHis shape makes sense here but some of his experienced starters are letting him down: Brattan, McGree and Irvine not sure of their roles in midfield, Duke totally isolated. \u201cThe stage is set for Irankunda.\u201d Even that early chance for Kubo wasn\u2019t as good as I first thought. Souttar was on him quickly so his only option was to thrash it towards the near post, which Gauci had covered. Some half-time reading Half full or half empty? Depending on your perspective and disposition, that was either an admirably disciplined defensive performance from the Socceroos or a desperate survival mission that can\u2019t possibly last 90 minutes. Australia were poor in possession \u2013 that\u2019s probably being kind \u2013 but restricted Japan to a single good chance when Take Kubo hit the side netting early on. The defence have certainly earned their half-time breather. 45 min One minute of added time. 44 min The atmosphere is tremendous. 42 min Some really neat football from Japan on the left side of the area, but again Australia keep the gaps small and Souttar (I think) comes across to clear. 41 min Ueda\u2019s header is saved by Gauci, though it was off target and he\u2019d been penalised anyway for a foul on Burgess. That aside it was the champagne moment of the game. 40 min Another way to look at this first half is that Joe Gauci has only had one straightforward save to make. Australia have certainly defended well but I\u2019m not sure the concentration levels required are sustainable for 95 minutes. 38 min A better couple of minutes for the Socceroos, most of which is spent in the Japan half. 36 min Doan shuffles menacingly into the area only to leave the ball behind and lose it to Burgess. Australia need half time. 34 min The corner is half cleared, then belted back across goal and just in front of a lunging Japan player at the far post. Australia are living dangerously. 33 min Mitoma runs at poor Lewis Miller again. This time he cuts inside, onto his right foot, and curls a shot that hits Geria\u2019s shoulder and deflects behind. That may well have been going in the far corner. 31 min That was a slightly risky tackle from Itakura, who had to get between Bos and the ball and then drag it away. It would have been a penalty had he got it wrong but his timing was immaculate. 30 min Foul or not, the Socceroos aren\u2019t keeping the ball well enough. They didn\u2019t park the bus at the start but they have now. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the plan, just a natural retreat. Bos tries to change the mood with a thrilling run. He won the ball off Kubo near the halfway line and went straight for goal, no other thought in his mind. He reached the edge of the area before trying to slither between Taniguchi and Itakura; the latter made a really good tackle. 29 min Duke complains to the referee that Taniguchi seems to go through the back of him. The referee doesn\u2019t give a free-kick, never mind a yellow card. I thought Duke slipped but the impassioned nature of his complaint suggests that might not have been the case. 27 min Another corner for Japan. Harry Souttar, who has already made multiple interceptions, is blowing. Kubo\u2019s outswinging corner is headed over by Taniguchi, a tough chance as he was moving away from goal. 26 min \u201cDo let Peter Adams know my Paramount is working (annoying for him it seems like it\u2019s just his system),\u201d says Dechlan Brennan. \u201cAs a side note, in Aus, we used to just have football on one pay TV channel. Now it\u2019s four different streaming services needed. More and more like the UK.\u201d 23 min Australia are starting to look a little strained. A cross from the right leads to a couple of mishit shots, the second of which dribbles through to Gauci. 22 min Japan are starting to get round the back in wide positions. Taniguchi\u2019s long driven pass is controlled adroitly on the run by Kubo, who moves away from Bos and into the area. Burgess comes across to concede a corner. 20 min Mitoma beats Miller with ease down the left. His cutback from the byline is intercepted and, though Japan recycle possession, Itakura eventually overhits a cross out of play. Mitoma, surprise surprise, looks a big threat. 19 min The atmosphere sounds tremendous. Australia have at least quietened the crowd in a metaphorical sense by restricting Japan to a single chance in the first 19 minutes. 17 min \u201cParamount+ not working,\u201d says Peter Adams. \u201cContent not available. Please try again. Are others having trouble?\u201d I\u2019m in the UK, watching it on onefootball.com. Not sure it it\u2019s available in Australia though. 16 min Possession percentage: Japan 68-32 Australia. 15 min A clever corner from Japan. Kubo curls it deep towards Doan, arriving late and unmarked in the box. He mishits a difficult volley into the ground and Gauci saves comfortably. 15 min Mitoma beats Miller for the first time with that beautiful change of pace he has. His low cross is cut out at the near post by the well-positioned Geria. 14 min I should stress that Australia haven\u2019t parked the bus. They\u2019re getting on the ball when they can and Hrustic has just been sent flying by Machida after laying the ball off. There\u2019s a VAR check for a possible red card but it\u2019s cleared very quickly. 12 min On Chris Paraskevas\u2019s point (2 mins), I\u2019ve just become aware of this recent business. Whatever happened to Gary Cooper? 10 min That Kubo chance is the only time Japan have got behind Australia and that involved a fairly significant deflection. It\u2019s been a good start, all told, and there\u2019s only another 80 minutes plus added time left. 9 min Japan are playing some clever, intricate football. But so far Australia, as requested by Rob Haigh, have been compactness itself. 8 min \u201cThis is a backs-to-the-wall match now,\u201d says Rob Haigh. \u201cJapan are the big opposition. It\u2019s about being compact, squeezing the pitch, a tight press when not in possession, not allowing Japan to play through the middle, draw them in then hit them on the counter. Oz do have intelligent players, Goodwin is the key man who pulls it altogether. It\u2019s not going to be an easy game whatsoever, they have to be patient and concentrate.\u201d It\u2019s a worry if Craig Goodwin is the key man as he\u2019s on the bench. Maybe it\u2019s part of the plan: keep it tight for another, then get him on the ball when the game opens up in the last 30 minutes. I\u2019m surprised more coaches don\u2019t do that. 7 min Hrustic\u2019s free-kick from the right is headed well wide by Duke on the edge of the area. He got up well but it\u2019s a big ask to score from there. 6 min: Chance for Japan Kubo cuts inside from the right and finds Tanaka near the edge of the area. He produces a bit of fancy footwork and then flicks a pass that deflects back towards Kubo, who belts a first-time shot into the side netting. Not a sitter, but certainly a chance. 4 min \u201cGee Rob,\u201d says James Cahill. \u201cEarly start for the Pakistan v England Test match and then a swift switch to this. Have you annoyed off The Man this much?\u201d As long as He is dispensing beans, I\u2019ll dance for them. 3 min Plenty of early possession for Japan. I feel like I type that in every MBM these days, apart from the \u2018Japan\u2019 bit. The point being, I suppose, that in terms of intent there are fewer 50/50 games than there used to be. 2 min \u201cI see the mind games are well underway with the old \u2018Bus broke down/reverse Don Revie\u2019 trick,\u201d writes Chris Paraskevas. \u201cCan you imagine having to be the driver to tell Tony Popovic that the engine won\u2019t start? \u201cMany years ago when I p\u0336l\u0336a\u0336y\u0336e\u0336d\u0336 embarrassed myself at junior cricket, I remember one team would consistently use the same move: 15 minutes to the toss, 10 minutes... no sight of the reigning champions. \u201cOf course, they\u2019d all pile out of a single van five minutes before play, proceeding to humiliate all of us. Arguably this is a different dynamic but maybe the Japanese genuinely didn\u2019t expect us to turn up tonight?\u201d I mean there is precedent of sorts. 1 min Peep peep! After a small, unofficial delay to the kick-off time, Australia get the match under way. They\u2019re kicking from right to left as we watch. \u201cLuke Brattan is an interesting player,\u201d writes Phil Withall. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s finally getting his chance on the international stage, his sterling work for Brisbane during the Ange years will never be forgotten. Although the marvellous moment he signed for Man City, posted a picture of himself in an alley in Manchester and promptly left the club will probably remain his career highlight...\u201d You could make a very fine XI of players who signed for City and never kicked a ball. Our man in Tokyo says both teams requested a delay to the kick-off and were rejected by the Asian Football Confederation. That\u2019s pretty ordinary, and there are a few alternative words as well. The story so far A reminder that the top two qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup; the teams in third and fourth go forward to yet another round of qualification, from which they may never escape. A reminder of the two teams Japan (3-4-2-1) Suzuki; Itakura, Taniguchi, Machida; Doan, Tanaka, Morita, Mitoma; Minamino, Kubo; Ueda. Substitutes: Sugawara, Fujita, Maeda, Osako, Nakamura, Ito, Kamada, Mochizuki, Ogawa, Hatate, Seko, Tani. Australia (3-4-2-1) Gauci; Geria, Souttar, Burgess; Miller, Irvine, Brattan, Bos; McGree, Hrustic; Duke. Substitutes: Ryan, Izzo, Deng, Rowles, Yazbek, Velupillay, Stamatelopoulos, Irankunda, Arzani, Behich, Baccus, Goodwin. As you were. But it\u2019s far from ideal preparation for such a tough game. We may have a delayed kick off. No official word yet but we\u2019ll keep you posted. In the aftermath of the win in Adelaide last Thursday, Popovic preached that the national team needed to be a more difficult environment for players than they encountered at their clubs. He concedes that it to be hard work for those that come in and, if they wish to return, they need to maintain an elite level outside international duty. Indeed, if there has been one theme that has run through the Socceroos since Popovic\u2019s arrival, it has been a demand to be elite each and every day, not just in green and gold. Hajime Moriyasu makes two change from the team that beat Saudi Arabia 2-0 in Jeddah: Real Sociedad\u2019s Take Kubo and Leeds United\u2019s Ao Tanaka replace Daichi Kamada and the captain Wataru Endo, who isn\u2019t in the squad. Japan (3-4-2-1) Suzuki; Itakura, Taniguchi, Machida; Doan, Tanaka, Morita, Mitoma; Minamino, Kubo; Ueda. Substitutes: Sugawara, Fujita, Maeda, Osako, Nakamura, Ito, Kamada, Mochizuki, Ogawa, Hatate, Seko, Tani. Tony Popovic has changed more than half the XI that started against China on Thursday. Not sure anyone saw that coming. Luke Brattan, 34, will make his international debut in midfield. In Jason Geria, Cam Burgess, Jordy Bos, Luke Brattan, Ajdin Hrustic, Riley McGree Out Thomas Deng, Kye Rowles, Aiden O\u2019Neill, Aziz Behich, Craig Goodwin, Nestory Irankunda. Paul Williams on Japan\u2019s rise The foundation for Japan\u2019s modern-day success, with a depth of talent the envy of the continent, is the domestic J League, founded in 1993 and now boasting 60 teams across three divisions \u2013 all connected by promotion and relegation. The A-League, by comparison, still has only 13 teams and no prospect of an aligned second division on the horizon. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Socceroos\u2019 World Cup qualifier against Japan in Saitama. It\u2019s not often Australia are rank outsiders in an Asian Federation game but that\u2019s the case tonight. They haven\u2019t beaten Japan since 2009 and are already five points behind them in Group C. The 3-1 win over China on Thursday restored a bit of order but the fact Japan won the equivalent fixture 7-0 tells you where Australia are right now. While the games against Saudi Arabia and Bahrain will probably determine whether Australia take the second automatic qualification place, this match is a useful health check against the highest-ranked team in Asia. A draw would a terrific result; a win would be one for the books. Kick off 9.35pm AEDT/7.35pm local",

      "bodyText": "The department store chain Fenwick, which closed its historic shop on London\u2019s Bond Street in February, has reported its seventh year of losses as sales fell. The family-owned group, which is left with eight department stores led by Newcastle, said sales fell 3% to \u00a3299m in the year to January and it almost halved losses to \u00a338m. Owners of preference shares in the business were paid a \u00a33m dividend despite the ongoing losses, roughly in line with the prior year. \u201cTrading was challenging\u201d, directors said in accounts filed at Companies House this week. They said Fenwick faces \u201csignificant and growing competition from online retailers\u201d while consumer confidence and spending had been hit by a \u201cvolatile environment\u201d caused by higher energy and commodity costs and rising interest rates. Fenwick and other department stores including Selfridges and House of Fraser are struggling to cope with the rise of online shopping, which allows consumers to research and buy branded goods from home. The rise of luxury specialists such as Farfetch and Net-a-Porter has combined with a squeeze on spare cash for aspirational shoppers from rising interest rates and energy bills. Fenwick, which was founded in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1882 by John James Fenwick, announced in 2022 it was closing its Bond Street store to invest in its other stores, much to the dismay of regular customers who spoke to the Guardian before the shop closed its doors in February this year. The retailer said: \u201cFenwick is off to a great start for its next evolution having unveiled a new Beauty Hall on 10 October in its flagship Newcastle store following a \u00a340m million installation investment, opening new restaurants such as Fuego and Mason &amp; Rye, and streamlining operations behind the scenes in its Killingworth warehouse.\u201d The update on Fenwick\u2019s financial performance comes as the retailer is back on the search for its third chief executive since 2018. Longstanding former Harrods executive Nigel Blow was poised to become boss of Fenwick this month but has not taken up the role amid controversy about the alleged behaviour of the late owner of the Knightsbridge department store. Blow worked at Harrods for more than 14 years from 1992 to 2007 when the retailer was owned by Mohamed Al Fayed. Al Fayed was the subject of a recent BBC documentary based on the accounts of more than 20 women who said he had sexually assaulted them. Blow has said he had no knowledge of Al Fayed\u2019s abuse of the women during his time at Harrods. He was to replace John Edgar, a former Selfridges and Harrods executive, who served for nearly five years after taking over from former Argos executive Robbie Feather, the group\u2019s first non-family boss who was in the role for less than two years.",

      "body": "<p>Unifil, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, has accused the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of deliberate and shocking violations in recent days. Several of its positions have come under fire, prompting interventions from the UN security council and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, among others.</p>  <h2>What is Unifil and what does it do?</h2>  <p>The <a href=\"https://unifil.unmissions.org/\">United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon</a> was established to patrol the country\u2019s southern frontier after Israel invaded in 1978. The UN\u2019s top decision-making body, the security council, has since renewed and expanded its mandate repeatedly, notably during Israel\u2019s 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon between 1982 and 2000. Unifil\u2019s role was further updated at the end of the 2006 war with Hezbollah.</p> <p>At its core, the agency seeks to keep the peace in areas between Lebanon and Israel. To do so, it monitors any movements of Israeli or Lebanese forces across the \u201cblue line\u201d, a 75-mile (120km) UN-mapped line that has become a de facto border. It is also tasked with helping the Lebanese national army keep the area free of militants. This has not worked because Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s most powerful political and military force, effectively controls the south of the country.</p> <h2>Who are the peacekeepers and where do they operate?</h2>  <p>The 10,000-strong Unifil force is <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/unifil\">drawn from 50 countries</a>, backed by about 800 civilian staff. Indonesia is the biggest contributor with more than 1,200 uniformed personnel, followed by India, Ghana, Nepal and Italy. Spain, France and Ireland also contribute troops and have spoken out for their safety. The area of operations for UN peacekeepers is marked by the Litani River in the north and the blue line in the south. Unifil forces operate from 29 positions across southern Lebanon.</p> <h2>What has happened in recent weeks?</h2>  <p>Since Israel invaded Lebanon on 1 October, its forces have repeatedly fired on Unifil positions, as well as on medics and first responders. Unifil has blamed the IDF for a string of violations, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/unifil-israeli-tanks-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran\">forcibly entering a base on Sunday</a>. The UN peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said on Monday that five peacekeepers had been injured in recent days and that the UN had protested about this to Israel.</p> <h2>What has Israel said?</h2>  <p>Israel has demanded the peacekeepers evacuate the area, which would in effect neuter the force. It says Unifil has failed to keep Hezbollah militants \u2013 who have engaged in a tit-for-tat war with Israel for years \u2013 out of southern Lebanon.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said Israel \u201cwill make every effort to prevent Unifil<strong> </strong>casualties\u201d. This contradicts Unifil\u2019s assertion that it has been deliberately fired on. He also accuses the peacekeepers of \u201cproviding a human shield\u201d to Hezbollah.</p> <p>Both Israel and Hezbollah place their forces near Unifil positions.</p> <h2>Can Unifil fire back when attacked?</h2>  <p>Technically yes, although in practice it does not.

      "bodyText": "Unifil, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, has accused the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of deliberate and shocking violations in recent days. Several of its positions have come under fire, prompting interventions from the UN security council and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, among others. What is Unifil and what does it do? The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was established to patrol the country\u2019s southern frontier after Israel invaded in 1978. The UN\u2019s top decision-making body, the security council, has since renewed and expanded its mandate repeatedly, notably during Israel\u2019s 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon between 1982 and 2000. Unifil\u2019s role was further updated at the end of the 2006 war with Hezbollah. At its core, the agency seeks to keep the peace in areas between Lebanon and Israel. To do so, it monitors any movements of Israeli or Lebanese forces across the \u201cblue line\u201d, a 75-mile (120km) UN-mapped line that has become a de facto border. It is also tasked with helping the Lebanese national army keep the area free of militants. This has not worked because Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s most powerful political and military force, effectively controls the south of the country. Who are the peacekeepers and where do they operate? The 10,000-strong Unifil force is drawn from 50 countries, backed by about 800 civilian staff. Indonesia is the biggest contributor with more than 1,200 uniformed personnel, followed by India, Ghana, Nepal and Italy. Spain, France and Ireland also contribute troops and have spoken out for their safety. The area of operations for UN peacekeepers is marked by the Litani River in the north and the blue line in the south. Unifil forces operate from 29 positions across southern Lebanon. What has happened in recent weeks? Since Israel invaded Lebanon on 1 October, its forces have repeatedly fired on Unifil positions, as well as on medics and first responders. Unifil has blamed the IDF for a string of violations, including forcibly entering a base on Sunday. The UN peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said on Monday that five peacekeepers had been injured in recent days and that the UN had protested about this to Israel. What has Israel said? Israel has demanded the peacekeepers evacuate the area, which would in effect neuter the force. It says Unifil has failed to keep Hezbollah militants \u2013 who have engaged in a tit-for-tat war with Israel for years \u2013 out of southern Lebanon. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said Israel \u201cwill make every effort to prevent Unifil casualties\u201d. This contradicts Unifil\u2019s assertion that it has been deliberately fired on. He also accuses the peacekeepers of \u201cproviding a human shield\u201d to Hezbollah. Both Israel and Hezbollah place their forces near Unifil positions. Can Unifil fire back when attacked? Technically yes, although in practice it does not. As a peacekeeping mission, Unifil says its \u201cpersonnel may exercise their inherent right of self-defence\u201d and may use \u201cproportionate and gradual use of force\u201d to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence. What are Israeli-UN relations like? Israel has a hostile relationship with the UN and has attacked its schools, medical centres and aid workers. The antagonism is in large part the result of the role that UN aid and rights bodies have played over the decades in protecting Palestinians and highlighting abuses under Israeli occupation. Israel has long accused the world body of being biased against it. Netanyahu has called it a \u201chouse of darkness\u201d and a \u201cswamp of antisemitic bile\u201d. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who has spoken out against Israel\u2019s killings, was recently made persona non grata.",

Pakistan and England are back at the Multan Cricket Stadium for the second Test, playing on the same surface as last week, but Pakistan are hoping for a completely different ball game. They have recalled three spinners with a combined age of 105 and are gambling that the dead pitch of the first Test will come dramatically to life like a slasher movie villain.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite a gamble, but maybe Pakistan don\u2019t have much left to lose. They\u2019ve been beaten in their last six Tests, equalling their worst-ever run, and responded to defeat in the first Test by leaving out arguably their three best players: Babar Azam, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah. If they\u2019re not at rock bottom, they\u2019re certainly in the same postcode.</p> <p>Pakistan are in such a mess, in fact, that it feels inevitable they will rout England to square the series. There\u2019s are few teams in world sport who are more dangerous when they are in complete disarray, and Pakistan will aim to play with the freedom of the cornered tiger.</p> <p>England have also made changes, with the fit-again Ben Stokes and Matthew Potts replacing Chris Woakes and Gus Atkinson. Stokes will bowl a bit in an all-Durham pace attack that also includes Brydon Carse, the man who drew the short straw and will have to go again on that thing, in that heat.</p> <p>It\u2019s common for white-ball games to be played on used pitches. But nobody can remember it happening in a Test and anything is possible over the next few days. For all we know, by days nine and ten the ball might be turning backwards. Mind the cracks.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Simon Burnton\u2019s report is in, so it\u2019s time for me to say goodbye. Rob Smyth and Adam Collins will provide you company tomorrow. See ya! Jeremy Boyce provides his verdict: I\u2019m thinking Captain Stokes and his merry band will be well happy to have 5 down before the end of the first day, possibly more now with the new ball. They could be batting by lunch tomorrow at which point they\u2019ll be planning for lots of beef from the openers, followed by lots of Yorkshire Pudding and lower order gravy train. Which should help deliver them their just desserts. Leach has two wickets but Carse gets my nod for the bowler of the day, taking 1-14 from 11 overs. He managed to find control with the reversing ball, nicking off Saud Shakeel. The batting star was Kamran Ghulam, hitting a century in his maiden Test innings. That\u2019s some achievement when you\u2019ve been selected in place of Babar Azam, one of Pakistan\u2019s finest ever. 90th over: Pakistan 259-5 (Salman 5, Rizwan 37) Leach is granted the honour of bowling the day\u2019s final over. Rizwan turns a fuller ball into a full toss, getting down the pitch to hit straight for four. Dots follow to close the day, one both sides will be pleased with. Pakistan have a platform but they haven\u2019t run away with it. 89th over: Pakistan 255-5 (Salman 5, Rizwan 33) Nice bowling from Bashir, who slides through a non-turning delivery past Salman\u2019s outside edge. 88th over: Pakistan 254-5 (Salman 5, Rizwan 32) Leach concedes a couple of singles before very nearly sneaking a low one through Salman. Pakistan\u2019s No 7 does well to get down and stop it from creeping past. 87th over: Pakistan 252-5 (Salman 4, Rizwan 31) Bashir gives the ball some decent hang-time, trying to invite something silly from the two batters late in the day. They opt for an exchange of singles. 86th over: Pakistan 249-5 (Salman 2, Rizwan 30) Leach is called in to get that new ball to skid on to the stumps. Rizwan cuts off the back foot for a couple; he\u2019s relished spin today, looking uneasy against the quicks. 85th over: Pakistan 245-5 (Salman 1, Rizwan 27) Salman Ali Agha, very much a man in form, partners up with Rizwan. Bashir gets a go, Stokes backing his off-spinner \u2013 and it works! Ghulam, as he\u2019s done all day, skips down the pitch but misses the ball this time round. It clips the bails and the centurion departs. Bashir roars. 84th over: Pakistan 243-4 (Ghulam 118, Rizwan 26) Smith, whose glovework has been solid today, collects down the leg side as England appeal for a tickle from Ghulam. \u201cWAIT ON!\u201d shouts Ghulam, who has a touch of Smith/Labuschagne exuberance about him. He drives Potts through the covers for three. This was the debutant\u2019s special moment from before, one he would have spent years, decades dreaming of. 83rd over: Pakistan 240-4 (Ghulam 115, Rizwan 26) Carse looks such a threat against Rizwan whenever he angles the ball into the stumps. It\u2019s how he got rid of him in the last Test on that wild fourth day. 82nd over: Pakistan 239-4 (Ghulam 114, Rizwan 26) Potts gets some sharp movement into Rizwan and then away from him, the batter left shotless on both occasions. A wild charge down the pitch follows from Rizwan, an admission that he\u2019s struggling against this fresh cherry \u2013 he only makes contact with the air. 81st over: Pakistan 239-4 (Ghulam 114, Rizwan 26) Stokes takes the second new ball and turns to the impressive Carse. But Ghulam opts to immediately punish, driving down the ground for four. The quick recovers to nip a couple away from Ghulam. 80th over: Pakistan 235-4 (Ghulam 110, Rizwan 26) Ghulam sweeps Root away for four and then tries a reverse that doesn\u2019t beat the field. But, hey, he looks as if he\u2019s having a great time. 79th over: Pakistan 228-4 (Ghulam 103, Rizwan 26) England opt for a review after Rizwan tries to swat Bashir through the leg side, the ball instead skipping into Jamie Smith\u2019s gloves. Was there a little tickle? Absolutely not \u2013 the bat\u2019s in Multan, the ball\u2019s in Karachi. 78th over: Pakistan 226-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 25) I get the sense England are trying to quickly get to that new ball, with Root running briskly through another set. 77th over: Pakistan 225-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 24) Bashir bowls what he needs: a quiet over. There\u2019s just one off it. 76th over: Pakistan 224-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 23) Root continues from the other end, with Rizwan sweeping for one. The Pakistan keeper has started to find some joy after a tough start against the quicks with the reversing ball. 75th over: Pakistan 223-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 22) Shoaib Bashir re-enters the game and is immediately under the pump, Rizwan discarding him for two boundaries through deep midwicket. Excuse the shameless plug, but this is something I wrote about first Test hundreds a few years ago. Joe Root gets to have a twirl, with Ghulam nicking a single to move to 98. Another single brings Ghulam back for the last two deliveries, and he swings across the line off the final ball, all the way to the ropes to celebrate his maiden Test hundred! Root offered a tempter, and Ghulam, who\u2019s been mighty happy to take some risks, slapped that one hard through midwicket. An emphatic celebration follows. He\u2019s the first Pakistani to hit a hundred on Test debut since Abid Ali in 2019. 74th over: Pakistan 218-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 13) 73rd over: Pakistan 208-4 (Ghulam 97, Rizwan 12) Rizwan tries to channel his inner Ghulam, charging Potts for a wild hack; he doesn\u2019t find the middle. A maiden follows, with Ghulam, on the cusp of a debut hundred, going two overs without the strike. And to test his patience further, it\u2019s drinks. 72nd over: Pakistan 208-4 (Ghulam 97, Rizwan 12) Rizwan gets the forward defence out, again and again, before punching for a single to end Leach\u2019s over. 71st over: Pakistan 207-4 (Ghulam 97, Rizwan 11) Potts finds some late swing with a yorker to Ghulam, who gets his toes out of the way to find three through the leg side. He moves to 97. Kim Thonger lays out some bars: There once was a batter named Ghulam, Whose bat was as sturdy as glulam. He swung with great might, Hit sixes in flight, Till the crowd broke out into bedlam! 70th over: Pakistan 203-4 (Ghulam 94, Rizwan 10) Leach locates some sharp spin and bounce, getting one to rip past Rizwan\u2019s forward prod. 69th over: Pakistan 200-4 (Ghulam 93, Rizwan 8) Matt Potts replaces Carse, who\u2019s earned a breather. A snorter squares up Rizwan, beating the outside edge. An edge follows, running low to give Rizwan a couple. Ooooh, a replay at the end of the over shows there was a very thin edge on that Potts pearler. Osman is the man to listen to here: 68th over: Pakistan 197-4 (Ghulam 92, Rizwan 6) Ghulam knocks Leach down the ground for one, bringing Rizwan on strike. He finally gets himself off none, driving through cover for a couple. A sweep for four follows. Rizwan\u2019s a wonderful player, a key man in Pakistan\u2019s strong middle to lower order \u2013 he averages above 40 in every format of the game. 67th over: Pakistan 190-4 (Ghulam 91, Rizwan 0) Carse is causing Rizwan serious bother, finding the outside edge, but the ball doesn\u2019t carry to slip. A wonderful away swinger follows, with Rizwan still waiting to score his first runs \u2013 he got a duck in the first innings of the last Test. This is a spell of tight lines, decent movement and sharp pace from Carse. A maiden keeps Rizwan scoreless after facing 18 balls. 66th over: Pakistan 190-4 (Ghulam 91, Rizwan 0) Better from Ghulam, who runs down to Leach again but gets to the pitch of the ball, swinging safely to nail a straight four. A similar shot is repeated, the ball launched over mid-on for another boundary, moving Ghulam into the 90s. 65th over: Pakistan 182-4 (Ghulam 83, Rizwan 0) Ghulam plays another wild shot, trying to smash Carse over Stokes\u2019 umbrella field \u2013 he gets away with it, the ball flying high but safely over the cover region. 64th over: Pakistan 179-4 (Ghulam 80, Rizwan 0) This could be some relief for the hosts, with Leach back on; the quicks were really troubling Pakistan. Don\u2019t mind me: Ghulam is dropped at mid-on. The right-hander shimmies down the pitch to try and hit over mid-on, doesn\u2019t get the required contact, but a leaping Duckett, moving high and to his right, can\u2019t hold on. 63rd over: Pakistan 178-4 (Ghulam 79, Rizwan 0) Carse nips the ball into Mohammad Rizwan\u2019s pads to prompt a hearty lbw appeal \u2026 it\u2019s an excellent shout but the finger doesn\u2019t go up. England opt against the review, perhaps thinking it\u2019s going over the stumps. Carse has one keep low to close the over, with Rizwan nearly chopping on to the stumps. Pakistan are in a tricky spot. 62nd over: Pakistan 178-4 (Ghulam 79, Rizwan 0) Stokes has set up one of his intimidating fields, with Ghulam staring at three men hovering in the close cover region. Potts produces a maiden; Ghulam is on 79 but has struggled to score for a while now. 61st over: Pakistan 178-4 (Ghulam 79, Rizwan 0) Carse has figures of 1-6 after six overs. He\u2019s been so impressive over the last week. Carse tests Shakeel\u2019s ticker, striking the left-hander\u2019s gloves with a bouncer. There\u2019s still reverse swing out there, with Carse moving it into Shakeel. And then the one that moves away to nab Shakeel\u2019s outside edge! It\u2019s a wonderful setup, inviting the prod outside off, and Jamie Smith takes a brilliant catch behind the stumps, a very sharp effort from a rapid Carse delivery. 60th over: Pakistan 177-3 (Ghulam 79, Shakeel 4) Ghulam, having hit just one off his previous 21 deliveries, decides to take a risk, making room for a basebally swing through mid-off for four off Potts. 59th over: Pakistan 173-3 (Ghulam 75, Shakeel 4) It\u2019s Carse, not Stokes, who thunders in from the other end, short mid-on and short-mid-off waiting for a loose drive from Saud Shakeel. Another maiden follows to build further pressure. 58th over: Pakistan 173-3 (Ghulam 75, Shakeel 4) Stokes continues with pace, Potts keeping things tight with a maiden to Ghulam. Time for the third session, with Pakistan operating responsibly thus far. Which brings me to my commute this morning: on a packed Northern Line, the man stood next to me \u2013 his armpit threatening to envelop my face \u2013 was watching Luca Guadagnino\u2019s intensely NSFW 2024 release, Challengers. It wasn\u2019t something he was continuing from the night before; no, he was watching it right from the start. Thoroughly maverick behaviour from the gilet-wearing finance bro. Now to see if Pakistan \u2013 those well-known agents of chaos \u2013 replicate such wild behaviour. They\u2019re capable of it. They\u2019re running through the replays of Potts\u2019 dismissal of Saim: it\u2019s a fine setup, the seamer sending the ball across the left-hander on a good length before pitching fuller to invite the tentative push forward, Stokes positioned perfectly at short mid-off. 57th over: Pakistan 173-3 (Ghulam 75, Shakeel 4) Stokes continues, bowling the final over of the session. Ghulam has been happy to just survive against the England captain, and a single brings Saud Shakeel on to strike for the last two balls of the over. Stokes finds the outside edge with the final ball, but Shakeel plays with soft hands, the ball staying low to run away past slip for four. Time for some chai. Matt Potts changes things up, going over the wicket to Saim. The seamer\u2019s third delivery of the over jags away from the left-hander before a wider ball is slashed hard \u2026 to point. After five dots \u2026 a wicket! Saim drives without conviction, finding Stokes at short mid-off. A productive stand comes to a close, Saim walking off with a Test-best if not a century. 56th over: Pakistan 168-3 (Ghulam 74) 55th over: Pakistan 168-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 77) Stokes is operating at an average speed of 80mph, still feeling his way back from injury. He continues to look more threatening against Ghulam, who plays out four consecutive dots. 54th over: Pakistan 167-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 76) Potts continues to skip in from around the wicket to Saim, keeping it stump-to-stump for the first three balls, perhaps setting him up for a wider delivery outside off to invite the edge. No, it\u2019s the bouncer that follows with the fourth, but it flies a touch too high. Saim then delivers a gorgeous straight drive, with Harry Brook leaping spectacularly to stop the boundary. 53rd over: Pakistan 164-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 73) Stokes finds Ghulam\u2019s outside edge again \u2026 but the ball drops short of Joe Root at slip. It\u2019s one thing getting the ball to reverse, but there\u2019s very little carry in this surface. Ghulam\u2019s dealing with cramp again, so there\u2019s a break in play. England use it to get a helmet on Root\u2019s head \u2013 he comes in closer to the stumps. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen slip wear a helmet before. 52nd over: Pakistan 162-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 72) Potts looks a threat to Saim Ayub, getting the ball to hoop in and challenge the left-hander\u2019s pads and stumps. He then gets one to move away from Saim, who chases it and edges away to third man for a boundary. A more convincing stroke follows from Saim, who flicks off his pads for four, Potts going a touch too straight from around the wicket. An inside-edge closes the over, Saim nearly chopping on to his stumps. 51st over: Pakistan 152-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 63) Stokes continues and unfurls a gorgeous outswinger against Ghulam, the ball sneaking past the outside edge. Another edge follows next ball, the ball keeping low to run away to the third-man rope. Ghulam is getting a serious test here, with Stokes deciding to challenge the toes; out comes the yorker, dug out by the right-hander. They\u2019ve got a proper 2013 playlist going in Multan as John Newman\u2019s Love Me Again rings out. 50th over: Pakistan 145-2 (Ghulam 68, Saim 62) Matt Potts is called in, Stokes recognising that it\u2019s time for the quicks to go to work. Potts brings the ball back into the left-handed Saim Ayub, conceding one from the over. Showbizguru writes: \u201cThe theme tune from the 2012 Bond movie Skyfall seems to be a regular choice for break music at the Multan stadium. What England need now is a Thunderball. I\u2019ll get my coat.\u201d 49th over: Pakistan 144-2 (Ghulam 68, Saim 61) Ben Stokes decides to do it himself, taking off Brydon Carse. There\u2019s a touch of reverse swing in the air and Stokes knows how to harness it. He\u2019s loose to begin with, though; Ghulam punches through the covers for a couple. The next ball is far more threatening, with Stokes getting the ball to move away from the right-hander. Ghulam calls over the Pakistan doc, potentially cramping up as he shakes his right hand; time for the TV cameras to intensely focus on a man eating some ice-cream. As you do. Dots follow before Stokes squares Ghulam up with the final ball of the over, moving it away again to find the outside edge, the ball running away to the boundary for four. Nevermind the runs, there\u2019s something to play with here for England. 48th over: Pakistan 138-2 (Ghulam 62, Saim 61) Hello, all, lovely to be here. Jack Leach continues after a few words of wisdom/affirmation/sweet nothings from captain Stokes. Kamran Ghulam skips down the pitch for a rather loose hoick across the line, getting a thick edge to collect three. Saim Ayub adventures down the wicket, too, playing a lovely lofted drive over mid-off for four. 47th over: Pakistan 131-2 (Saim 57, Ghulam 59) Stokes has decided it\u2019s time for Brydon Carse, whose name is crying out for the late Tony Greig to be on commentary. His first ball, bowled from round the wicket to Saim, beats the inside edge and is superbly taken on the bounce by Jamie Smith. There\u2019s nothing he can do later in the over when Carse rams one down the leg side for four byes. There was a hint of reverse swing in that over \u2013 a mite, a soup\u00e7on \u2013 so this could be England\u2019s opportunity. Taha Hashim will track every last millimeter of deviation; he\u2019s ready to take over for the rest of the day\u2019s play. Bye! 46th over: Pakistan 127-2 (Saim 57, Ghulam 59) Ghulam\u2019s fast hands allow him to back cut Leach for two. It\u2019s one thing to come out at 19 for two on debut, quite another when your team are on their knees and you\u2019re replacing their best player. In that context this has been a gem of an innings. 45th over: Pakistan 125-2 (Saim 57, Ghulam 57) Ghulam reverse sweeps Bashir for for, the first sign of impudence from him. Pakistan are inching towards what might be a very handy position. Let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019re all hedging our bets because we have no idea what this pitch will do. It might crumble completely; it might stay like this. Ben Stokes has a look at the ball, decides it isn\u2019t reverse-ready and throws it back to Jack Leach. 44th over: Pakistan 120-2 (Saim 57, Ghulam 52) Not for the first time today, Leach almost skids an arm ball through Ghulam. He\u2019s quick enough on his feet to get out of trouble but that looks a potential mode of dismissal for England. Saim carts a slog sweep for two to bring up the hundred partnership. It was a slightly loose shot but safe enough with nobody at deep midwicket. \u201cPicking up on Kim Thonger\u2019s comments on the Elon Morgan robot,\u201d begins Oliver Haill. \u201cIt made me think of Dennis Lillee coming out to the middle with an aluminium bat. (The ComBat, it was called, apparently.) As this was not allowed and he was forced to change back to a traditional willow number, I\u2019m thinking the laws of cricket might allow wooden robots...?\u201d Heh. There was a funny story about that aluminium bat on the recent Cricket Et Al podcast with Greg Chappell. My short-term memory has gone to pot so I can\u2019t remember the detail, only that it made me chuckle. But the whole podcast is great, including a fascinating discussion of the book Psycho-Cybernetics. That it was easier to remember. 43rd over: Pakistan 115-2 (Saim 54, Ghulam 50) Bashir, bowling round the wicket, gets one to bounce awkwardly at Ghulam. He fends that wide of leg slip and turns the next ball for a single to reach fine half-century, full of poise and pride. He\u2019s the first No4 to make a debut fifty for Pakistan since the man he replaced, Babar Azam, against West Indies eight years ago. And he celebrates by blowing a kiss to the Pakistan balcony. 42nd over: Pakistan 114-2 (Saim 54, Ghulam 49) England submit a polite enquiry for LBW when Saim misses a sweep off Leach. Outside the line. Leach is starting to get some quicker turn and beats Ghulam with a classic delivery to the right-hander: drift in, turn away, lots of oohs and aahs. \u201cWoke up to a horrible thought this morning,\u201d begins Pete Salmon. \u201cPakistan keep losing, there are no crowds, they don\u2019t even seem to know where the next Test will be, and must be losing money on the series. We\u2019ve seen players decide not to play Test cricket anymore, but might we be getting to a point where teams make that decision? Most teams now get nothing from Y=Test cricket financially, or in terms of crowds or prestige. Our worry with the big three has always been that teams will be squeezed out, but I can see a scenario where one team, Pakistan or otherwise, simply says they are going to stop playing Tests concentrate on T20... Allay my fears!\u201d Well, the good news is that AI is going to kill us all by the year 2030 so the future of Test cricket shouldn\u2019t impact us. 41st over: Pakistan 112-2 (Saim 54, Ghulam 48) 40th over: Pakistan 110-2 (Saim 54, Ghulam 46) Thwack! Saim launches Leach over midwicket for an eyecatching boundary, his fourth of the innings. It hasn\u2019t been a perfect innings, none are, but for the most part he has defended and attacked with an authority that belies his inexperience. 39th over: Pakistan 106-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 46) Kamran Ghulam came into his debut in abysmal form, with no centuries in six innings across formats. Trust me, for him that\u2019s a drought. He looks a good player: organised, assured and fearless, as he shows by slog-sweeping Bashir handsomely for a one-bounce four. Bashir, whose line to the right-hander has been much more aggressive today, continues to toss the ball up and almost gets one through Ghulam\u2019s attempted drive. Whatever the right and wrongs of the pitch, and we probably have to defer judgement on that until the end of the game, it has produced an engaging contest today. 38th over: Pakistan 100-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 40) Ghulam throws his entire being into a slog-sweep at Leach, misses and is lucky that the ball turns past off stump. Had it not turned so extravagantly he would have been cleaned up. Leach, who has bowled on plenty of helpful pitches at Ciderabad, is getting into a nice rhythm. Later in thbe over he also gets through Ghulam with a quicker arm ball. Almost. 37th over: Pakistan 99-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 39) Just when you think Pakistan are getting on top, something happens to remind you that a batter is probably never truly \u2018in\u2019 on this pitch. Those Leach deliveries have briefly spooked Saim, who trusts nothing but defence in that over from Shoaib. \u201cIrksome partnership needing breaking?\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cYou know who to call! Ghostb... er, Stokes.\u201d Doug Walters was apparently one of the great partnership breakers and \u2018Who ya gonna call? DOUG WALTERS\u2019 scans nicely. The fact he took his last wicket in 1977, seven years before Ghostbusters was released, might be considered problematic in some cultures though. 36th over: Pakistan 98-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 38) Leach beats Saim with successive deliveries, the second a beauty that somehow misses both the outside edge and the off stump. Leach starts to celebrate, then appeals, then asks Ben Stokes to review it. The response is the same as when he asks to put mid-off or mid-on back. 35th over: Pakistan 97-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 37) Saim drives Bashir for two to reach an excellent half-century, the third of his fledgling Test career, from 98 balls with three fours. It\u2019s been a mature innings, a fine response to his lamentable dismissal in the second innings of the first Test. There are oohs and aahs later in the over when he offers no stroke to a ball that doesn\u2019t miss off stump by all that much. It looked a safe leave to me. Bashir\u2019s last four Test wickets have cost over 100 runs apiece but he\u2019s bowled well today. Nothing to worry about yet. 34th over: Pakistan 95-2 (Saim 48, Ghulam 37) Between overs, Joe Root shines the ball on Jack Leach\u2019s head #baldcommunity. England will be looking for reverse swing soon because this partnership is becoming irksome. Saim cuts Leach firmly for four, despite the best efforts of Potts haring back from point, and a sikngle takes him to within two of a fine half-century. 33rd over: Pakistan 90-2 (Saim 43, Ghulam 37) Ghulam gives Bashir the charge and clumps the ball down the ground for couple, with Potts doing well to save the boundary. It was in the air, not off the middle, but it was safely wide of the diving Bashir. The shot has the desired effect. Bashir pulls his length back ever so slightly and Ghulam heaves two more through midwicket. 32nd over: Pakistan 85-2 (Saim 42, Ghulam 33) Now then. Leach beats Ghulam with a jaffa that turns sharply and quickly. That went through the top of the surface and was nigh-on unplayable. 31st over: Pakistan 84-2 (Saim 41, Ghulam 33) Shoaib Bashir, who arguably outbowled Leach this morning even though Leach took both wickets, returns to the attack and finds Saim\u2019s edge with a good ball that straightens and bounces. For the second time today it goes wide of the diving Stokes at slip and through the vacant gully region. Bashir tosses one up outside off stump, a much more aggressive line, and Ghulam drives for four with authority. \u201cRisk and reward,\u201d says Nasser on commentary. 30th over: Pakistan 79-2 (Saim 40, Ghulam 24) The morning session hinted that this is might be the rarest of surfaces, a new-ball pitch for the spinners. Or maybe Saim Ayub and Kamran Ghumal made it look that way by batting so well after Pakistan\u2019s poor start. Leach\u2019s first over is an accurate maiden to Ghulam. He\u2019s still hit just the one boundary, a perky straight six off Leach early in his innings. The players are back on the field. Jack Leach is going to replace Brydon Carse, who bowled a solitary over just before lunch. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of publicity about Elon Musk\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots since the last Test,\u201d says Kim Thonger, bringing news to me. \u201cAs a visionary he\u2019ll very likely already have spotted the success of the IPL and will have told his R&amp;D team to teach a few of the robots how to apply their superhuman skills to the white ball game. Imagine a robot with Shane Warne\u2019s bowling, Ben Stokes batting, and Eoin Morgan\u2019s captaincy skills. Unstoppable. I have a question. Do the laws of cricket permit a robot to be selected and deployed?\u201d They don\u2019t offer it yet, but Merlin is patiently awaiting the call. IS NOTHING SACRED England Women have a huge game later today, an effective quarter-final against West Indies at the T20 World Cup. Here\u2019s what Raf Nicholson has leared from the tournament to date. 29th over: Pakistan 79-2 (Saim 40, Ghulam 29) Saim looks a bit skittish as we approach lunch. He tries to pulls Potts, is too early on the shot and bottom-edges the ball short of Jamie Smith behind the stumps. So ends an intriguing morning session. Jack Leach, brought on inside the first half hour, took two early wickets to reduce Pakistan to 19 for two. But this used Multan pitch, while never entirely trustworthy, started to behave itself as the ball got a bit older and Saim Ayub put together an assured, positive partnership of 6o with the impressive debutant Kamran Ghulam. So far, so goodish for Pakistan. 28th over: Pakistan 78-2 (Saim 40, Ghulam 28) Brydon Carse also comes back into the attack just before lunch. Ben Stokes is the most accomplished reverse-swing bowler in this team so I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see him after lunch unless England run through Pakistan like a dose of salts. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. Carse has no slips and is generally attacking the stumps. He tries one bouncer that is ignored by Saim and goes through to Smith almost in slow motion; I wouldn\u2019t bother, Brydon. Saim looks for a quick single and is loudly sent back by Ghulam, then misses a loose cut stroke at a ball that\u2019s far too close for the shot. He could easily have dragged that back onto the stumps. 27th over: Pakistan 78-2 (Saim 40, Ghulam 28) No reverse swing for Potts, but he threatens the left-handed Saim with low bounce on a couple of occasions. The second was pretty close, a late inside-edge strangling England\u2019s LBW shout. Potts will always be dangerous on pitches like this because he bowls so straight. \u201cI\u2019ve just joined the action and am surprised to see England bowling already,\u201d says Jeremy Boyce. \u201cDid I miss some new Stokes mind games? Did he win the toss, elect to bat, declare at 0-0 after one ball, seeing the need to bowl a lot to take the 20 wickets, and backing his batt(er)ers to perform in their only appearance at the crease?\u201d Indulgent declarations are so Bazball 1.0. Edit: It looks like Ben Stokes will not wait until after lunch to see if there\u2019s any reverse swing. Matthew Potts is coming back into the attack. 26th over: Pakistan 75-2 (Saim 37, Ghulam 28) It looks like Ben Stokes will wait until after lunch to see if there\u2019s any reverse swing. Leach continues and bowls another grubber that is well defened by Saim. When I say \u2018grubber\u2019 I mean it bounced around shin height, not the full Nasser. We need a different word for that, or maybe an abjective such as \u2018vile\u2019. 25th over: Pakistan 73-2 (Saim 36, Ghulam 27) Ah, Bashir has switched back to his original end. Saim almost runs himself out by trying to take a single to cover. He\u2019s rightly sent back and has to scramble to make his ground. The umpires go upstairs to check whether his bat bounced up, but he\u2019s okay. Later in the over Ghulam reaches outside off stump and edges wide of slip for three. Bashir has bowled nicely this morning and probably deserves a wicket. But then Saim and Ghulam have batted nicely and probably don\u2019t deserve to get out, so now what? 24th over: Pakistan 69-2 (Saim 35, Ghulam 24) Root replaces Bashir, who bowled a threatening spell of 8-1-17-0, althoguh technically they were two spells as he changed ends at one point. Saim drives a single to bring up a positive, clear-headed fifty partnership from 85 balls. \u201cPity that you have to get up so early for your duty,\u201d writes Krishnamoorthy V. \u201cBut the vicarious summer must feel good in this gloomy weather. Pakistan\u2019s strategy, should one call it that, appears like the last desperate lunge of blind man\u2019s bluff when jeering pirates have already slashed the man to a state of profuse bleeding.\u201d I\u2019d say the dastardly plan is working pretty well so far. 23rd over: Pakistan 67-2 (Saim 34, Ghulam 23) Not even CricViz\u2019s finest algorithm knows what would be a par score is on this pitch, but you suspect Pakistan would be happy with 250, thrilled with 300 and rhapsodic with 400. Saim Ayub smiles after repelling a grubber from Leach, then plonks his front foot down and hammers a slog-sweep for four. That\u2019s a terrific shot. \u201cWasn\u2019t there a to-do last winter that the pitch in Dharamsala was a used one?\u201d asks John W. Ah yes, I\u2019d forgotten that \u2013 it was used for a Ranji Trophy game, although from memory that was three weeks before the Test rather than three days. 22nd over: Pakistan 61-2 (Saim 28, Ghulam 23) Bashir has also changed ends. \u201cVery slow, very slow off the surface,\u201d says Aamir Sohail when Ghulam has time to defend a nice off-break. Bashir decides to change the angle by going round the wicket to the right-handed Ghulam, but his first ball is down the leg side. He can have another go next over. 21st over: Pakistan 59-2 (Saim 28, Ghulam 21) As expected Leach has changed ends. Ghulam rocks back to force him square on the off side for three runs, which takes him into the twenties. Whisper it but batting looks almost comfortable. 20th over: Pakistan 55-2 (Saim 27, Ghulam 18) Root replaces Leach, who might be about to change ends. England will be wary of bowling Root too much, even on this pitch, because his run-scoring drops off considerably when he bowls a lot of overs, particularly in Asia. Ghulam, who has started with impressive intent on debut, clatters three runs through the covers to bring up the Pakistan fifty. Saim drives two to deep extra cover and keeps the strike with a single off the last ball. He\u2019s also played well, especially as he was under pressure after that wretched dismissal in the first Test. 19th over: Pakistan 48-2 (Saim 23, Ghulam 15) Saying which, Bashir gets some sharp spin to Ghulam, who inside-edges onto his stomach. He sweeps the next ball in the air for two, a premeditated and risky shot. 18th over: Pakistan 46-2 (Saim 23, Ghulam 13) Leach almost skids one through Ghulam, who defends across his front pad at the last possible moment. James Walsh (14th over) was right \u2013 though the pitch is turning more than you\u2019d expect before lunch on day one, it\u2019s far from a minefield. 17th over: Pakistan 45-2 (Saim 23, Ghulam 12) 16th over: Pakistan 44-2 (Saim 23, Ghulam 11) Leach continues with a very funky field for Ghulam: slip, leg slip, short leg and two short extra covers. Two singles from the over. 15th over: Pakistan 42-2 (Saim 22, Ghulam 10) Saim edges Bashir wide of Stokes at slip for a couple. I think it would have carried to gully. Leach has taken the two wickets but Bashir is probably getting more out of the pitch, particularly to the left-handed Saim. But Pakistan are starting to counter-punch and Saim back cuts a short delivery for three more. That makes it 19 runs from the last three overs, a big improvement on 23 from the first 12. Time for drinks. 14th over: Pakistan 37-2 (Saim 17, Ghulam 10) Saim flashes Leach wristily through the covers for three, then Ghulam bashed his down the ground for six! That\u2019s a brilliant and brave shot; he\u2019d have received all sorts of abuse had he run past the ball and been stumped. One consequence of this pitch is that England are in serious danger of keeping up with the over rate; we\u2019re still inside the first hour and Shoaib Bashir is about to bowl the 15th. \u201cSpeaking as an under-the-duvet pre-dawn punter,\u201d flutters James Walsh, \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this a lot more than the start of the first Test. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s masses of turn\u2026\u201d No you\u2019re right; it\u2019s hardly a bunsen. I\u2019m probably guilty of putting two and two together to make a two-day Test. 13th over: Pakistan 27-2 (Saim 14, Ghulam 3) Saim tries to sweep Bashir and is beaten by a mile. That ball turned grotesquely. The only good thing for the batters is that, one delivery from Leach aside, the turn has been fairly slow and low. 12th over: Pakistan 23-2 (Saim 11, Ghulam 2) Forty-nine minutes into the Test match, a delivery from Leach bursts nastily at Saim, who gloves it wide of the diving short leg for a single. This is entertaining cricket but I\u2019m not sure it passes the smell test. I guess we should reserve judgement for now. In other news I forgot the Test Match Special overseas link, again, sorry. Here it is. 11th over: Pakistan 22-2 (Saim 10, Ghulam 2) I\u2019m not 100 per cent sure but I think this is the first time since Melbourne 1901-02 that England have had two spinners bowling inside the first half hour of a Test match. In the first Test there was a lot of talk of Bashir\u2019s defensive line to the right-handers. His first ball to Ghulam is more attacking, outside off, and Ghulam pushes it for a single. Saim drives another down the ground. 10th over: Pakistan 20-2 (Saim 8, Ghulam 1) Welcome to Test cricket, Kamran Ghulam. He\u2019s a 29-year-old right-hander with an excellent record in first-class cricket, and he gets off the mark with a slightly nervous thick edge. Leach strikes again. Shan flicks with hard hands at a delivery that turns just enough to induce a false stroke, and Crawley \u2013 such a reliable fielder \u2013 takes a superb low catch at short midwicket. I\u2019m not sure whether this is a burgeoning farce or merely a reflection of Pakistan\u2019s subterranean confidence. 9th over: Pakistan 17-1 (Saim 8, Shan 2) The arrival of Shan Masood means Bashir has two left-handers to play with. Saim is focussing entirely on defence against Bashir for now and there\u2019s just a single to Shan in that over. \u201cWith Leach getting that amount of movement after 30 mins, this match will be done in two days,\u201d says Gareth Wilson. \u201cEngland likely to be all out 220 off 40 overs.\u201d Surely they won\u2019t try to dig in on this pitch? 8th over: Pakistan 16-1 (Saim 8, Shan 1) England appeal unsuccessfully for LBW when the captain Shan Masood tries to sweep his first ball and misses. He was outside the line. England have four catchers on the leg side for Shan: leg slip, short leg, short midwicket and short mid-on. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story with the music between overs at Multan this morning?\u201d asks Julian. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve already heard AC/DC and Aerosmith, which all seems a somewhat incongruous in a practically empty stadium. Are the new selectors responsible for this as well?\u201d Haha. Each selector gets to pick one player and two bangers for the playlist. Tihngs are starting to happen on day six. Shafique has been bowled by a beauty from Leach, which curved onto off stump and then turned sharply to beat his defensive lunge. 7th over: Pakistan 15-0 (Shafique 7, Saim 8) Shoaib Bashir is coming as well. I wonder when England last used two spinners inside the first half hour of a Test match; not sure it has ever happened. On Sky, Mike Atherton makes the point that Stokes is probably keeping his seamers fresh for when/if the ball reverse swings. The expectation is that it will reverse in this game because the square is much drier. It will certainly turn, and Bashir serves notice of that by getting one to grip and beat Saim. Nicely bowled. 6th over: Pakistan 15-0 (Shafique 7, Saim 8) Jack Leach comes into the attack inside the first half hour of the game. He has a slip, short leg and short mid-on for Saim, who tries to drive the first ball and is beaten. Not a great shot. After he takes a single, Shafique clips a leg-stump full toss through midwicket for his first boundary. Leach has a similar field for the right-handed Shafique, but with short mid-on moved to short mid-off. No sign of extravagant turn in his first over. 5th over: Pakistan 10-0 (Shafique 3, Saim 7) Potts must be a pain in the arse to face. He\u2019s always making the batsmen play, usually from a length that brings both the edge and the front pad into play. Nag nag nag nag nag. His third over is a maiden to Shafique, and I\u2019m pretty sure all 18 deliveries so far have hit the bat. Jack Leach is already warming up. \u201cPakistan cricket is the nation\u2019s perfect metaphor for overnight chaos managed by a carousel of committees,\u201d says Zain Malik. \u201cThey\u2019ve turned up for this game like philosophers with a sledgehammer, smashing the idols of their biggest stars and conjuring a regiment of spinners on a pitch that\u2019s been through some sort of voodoo ritual. But don\u2019t write Pakistan off just yet. It\u2019s out of these absurd shake-ups that their most outlandish victories often emerge.\u201d Quite. But can we still call them cornered tigers if they beat England with spin rather than stumpbusting pace and reverse swing? 4th over: Pakistan 10-0 (Shafique 3, Saim 7) Shafique ducks under a bouncer, the first leave of the morning session from the 23rd delivery. That tells you how straight England are bowling in an attempt to maximise the uneven bounce. How weird it is to be talking about uneven bounce in the fourth over of a Test match. Carse puts his hands on his head when Shafique, who has started quite tentatively, inside-edges past leg stump for a single. 3rd over: Pakistan 9-0 (Shafique 2, Saim 7) Saim forces Potts crisply past point for four, making this the highest opening partnership he and Shafique have managed in nine attempts. Potts continues to make the batters play at pretty much every delivery. The last ball of the over keeps very low; thankfully for Pakistan it wasn\u2019t gunbarrel straight and Saim edges it well short of Smith. \u201cYou don\u2019t often see a sixth-day field,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cbut we have one now.\u201d I\u2019d love to see some of the fields in this game. Day nine, and Alan Melville has tried literally every field known to mankind, yet Bill Edrich is still batting. 2nd over: Pakistan 5-0 (Shafique 2, Saim 3) Brydon Carse\u2019s optimum role is as first-change enforcer, but the balance of England\u2019s side means he\u2019ll take the new ball in this game. Shafique is beaten by a heavy ball outside off stump and then works a single off the hip. Saim Ayub, who played a hideous shot off Carse in the second innings last week, pulls confidently for three to get off the mark. And then there\u2019s the first sign of uneven bounce: a shortish delivery that keeps low and is inside-edged onto the pad by Shafique. 1st over: Pakistan 1-0 (Shafique 1, Saim 0) With Woakes and Atkinson rested, Matthew Potts takes the first over for the first time in his Test career. He starts with two slips and a leg slip for Shafique, although Ben Stokes takes out the second slip after three balls. Potts starts well, making the batters play at all six deliveries. That\u2019s one of his great strengths: tight line, good-to-full length, always at the batter. Here come the Pakistan openers, Saim Ayub and Abdullah Shafique. The first target is to reach 10. Their eight opening partnership in Tests have all ended in single figures, with a miserable average of 2.87. Yep. \u201cPakistan, it seems, have taken the phrase \u2018lucky number seven\u2019 quite literally, winning the toss and tossing in not one, but s-e-v-e-n spinners,\u201d writes Zain Malik. \u201cDesperation? Maybe. Innovation? Definitely. The pitch? Rumored to turn faster than a drift car on a tight corner. But let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t get a repeat of the Pindi fiasco, where Shan and the boys brought four pacers expecting Headingley, only to find themselves bowling on something closer to a runway at Jinnah International.\u201d Does this constitute pitch doctoring? \u201cThe last Test was quite the thing, huh?\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cPakistan have thrown aside all the best practice guides of how Test cricket should be done ahead of this match... is this their tribute to Bazball?\u201d Ha, I hadn\u2019t thought of it like that. The trouble is we can\u2019t give it a name as nobody knows which of the 427-man selection committee has driven this change. Rameez Raja, talking on Sky Sports, doesn\u2019t think much of Pakistan\u2019s volte farce They\u2019re trying to change the DNA of Pakistan cricket\u2026 it\u2019s a cocktail of confusion\u2026 this is a leap of faith\u2026 they\u2019re trying to win at any cost\u2026 it\u2019s a rudderless ship, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s in charge\u2026 there\u2019s no consistency\u2026 this is a desperate move\u2026 I just hope for Pakistan\u2019s sake that somehow it works. After picking three new spinners and a used pitch, it\u2019s fair to say that\u2019s an important toss for Pakistan to win. \u201cYeah,\u201d smiles Ben Stokes, \u201cwe would have batted as well.\u201d Kamran Ghulam, a 29-year-old with a first-class average of 49, replaces Babar Azam and will make his Test debut. The three recalled spinners are Sajid Khan, Noman Ali and Zahid Mehmood; they come in for Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and the unwell Abrar Ahmed. Including occasional bowlers like Salman Agha, Pakistan have seven spinners in the team. England make two changes from the first Test. Ben Stokes and Matthew Potts are in; Chris Woakes and Gus Atkinson are putting their feet up. Pakistan Saim Ayub, Abdullah Shafique, Shan Masood (c), Kamran Ghulam, Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Salman Agha, Aamer Jamal, Sajid Khan, Noman Ali, Zahid Mehmood. England Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes (c), Smith (wk), Carse, Potts, Leach, Bashir. In using the same pitch Pakistan are, counterintuitively, breaking new ground. \u201cWe can discuss what we think it\u2019s going to do, but we won\u2019t really know until a day or a session has been played on it,\u201d said Ben Stokes, who has never seen the like and no idea what to expect. \u201cYou\u2019d like to think it will offer spinners more than it did last game. I\u2019m not sure the bowlers will like it, but you can still see the footmarks from the last Test. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d The more things stay the same, the more they change. Pakistan and England are back at the Multan Cricket Stadium for the second Test, playing on the same surface as last week, but Pakistan are hoping for a completely different ball game. They have recalled three spinners with a combined age of 105 and are gambling that the dead pitch of the first Test will come dramatically to life like a slasher movie villain. It\u2019s quite a gamble, but maybe Pakistan don\u2019t have much left to lose. They\u2019ve been beaten in their last six Tests, equalling their worst-ever run, and responded to defeat in the first Test by leaving out arguably their three best players: Babar Azam, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah. If they\u2019re not at rock bottom, they\u2019re certainly in the same postcode. Pakistan are in such a mess, in fact, that it feels inevitable they will rout England to square the series. There\u2019s are few teams in world sport who are more dangerous when they are in complete disarray, and Pakistan will aim to play with the freedom of the cornered tiger. England have also made changes, with the fit-again Ben Stokes and Matthew Potts replacing Chris Woakes and Gus Atkinson. Stokes will bowl a bit in an all-Durham pace attack that also includes Brydon Carse, the man who drew the short straw and will have to go again on that thing, in that heat. It\u2019s common for white-ball games to be played on used pitches. But nobody can remember it happening in a Test and anything is possible over the next few days. For all we know, by days nine and ten the ball might be turning backwards. Mind the cracks.",

As the coin arced through the air you could imagine his dread at the prospect of England batting first on a still-placid pitch against a collection of part-time or backup spinners and a single, third-choice seamer, but as last week it fell in his favour; this time they had to make it count.</p> <p>Playing, controversially, on the same pitch as that used for the first Test, England started with five overs of seam before switching to spin.

      "bodyText": "Taiwan is expected to have access to low earth orbit satellite internet service by the end of the month, a step the government says is crucial in case a Chinese attack cripples the island\u2019s communications. The forthcoming service is via a contract between Taiwan\u2019s main telecoms company, Chunghwa, and a UK-European company, Eutelsat OneWeb, signed last year, and marks a new milestone in Taiwan\u2019s efforts to address technological vulnerabilities, particularly its internet access, after attempts to get access to Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink service collapsed. Chunghwa co-president Alex Chien said 24-hour coverage was expected by the end of the month, with commercial access as soon as sufficient bandwidth was reached. Taiwan is under the threat of attack or invasion by China, which claims historical sovereignty over Taiwan and has vowed to annex it, by military force if necessary. In the meantime it is under a near constant barrage of cyber-attacks, and has had some of its 15 undersea cables connecting it and its outer islands to the world cut multiple times, usually by accidental anchor snags from passing ships. In response, it has pledged to build its own satellite network, pointing to the crucial utility of reliable networks in conflicts like Ukraine, where the armed forces largely rely on Musk\u2019s Starlink, the world\u2019s dominant low earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet provider. LEO satellites orbit between 200km and 2,000km above the Earth, often used for communications, sending signals to receiver terminals on the ground. More than half of the thousands of LEO satellites currently active are Starlink. OneWeb, initially a British company before it merged with Eurotel, has launched just a few hundred, the New York Times reported in March. Starlink is not available in Taiwan after negotiations reportedly fell apart over Taiwan\u2019s requirement that a local entity have a majority share of any joint venture established. There are also concerns among Taiwanese officials that Musk\u2019s business interests in China and his past remarks on Beijing\u2019s claim over Taiwan could affect the reliability of Starlink supply in the event of a conflict. Musk\u2019s largest Tesla factory is in China, and in 2023 he drew reproach from Taiwanese officials after he said Taiwan was an integral part of China, akin to Hawaii and the US. It came a few months after he suggested the conflict between China and Taiwan could be resolved if Taiwan just ceded some control to Beijing. \u201cIf the US Department of Defense requires it, Starlink should be able to support Taiwan,\u201d said Dr Shen Ming-Shih, the director of the national security division at Taiwan\u2019s government-backed thinktank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research. \u201cHowever, if Starlink is unwilling to provide it for considering the Chinese market, Taiwan must have a contingency plan.\u201d Shen said the provision of Eutelsat OneWeb services to Taiwan was significant, but not enough on its own. \u201cThe low-orbit satellites assisted by the UK at least make up for Taiwan\u2019s current needs, but they may still be interfered with or interrupted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to pursue additional systems, such as undersea cables, low-orbit satellites from other countries, etc.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s last president, Tsai Ing-wen, pledged almost $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) towards national space industry development, including a domestic satellite internet network.

Eating Persian meals together helped the family survive the absence of Iranian culture in the American south-west. \u201cFood was the biggest way for our family to teach us about Iran,\u201d said Derisavifard, 34. Her grandfather built an oven in the family garage, where her grandmother made bread. Growing up, Derisavifard baked with her mother, but ultimately decided to enter a more practical profession than being a chef.</p> <p>She majored in engineering at Southern Methodist University and after graduation got a job in finance, ultimately moving on to a healthcare non-profit. Cooking remained her passion, though. Two years ago, Derisavifard decided to take the leap into baking for money.

Last December, she started shipping her products direct to consumers nationwide.</p>    <p>Around that time, Derisavifard applied to participate in the New York-based non-profit food business incubator Hot Bread Kitchen (HBK).

Wait, it looks like Kamala Harris is up by five points. Yikes, now Trump is up by one-nineteenth of a point. Now, according to a much discussed NBC News poll that came out on Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/14/us-election-briefing-polls-show-election-tightening-as-trump-and-harris-seek-to-shore-up-support\">Trump and Harris are neck and neck</a>.</p> <p>As the US election draws closer, I have developed a severe case of poll-tigue. Can we just give the damn things a rest already? As we all know, polling is an inexact science at the best of times. More importantly, pretty much all the results of recent Trump-Harris polls have been within the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/upshot/when-you-hear-the-margin-of-error-is-plus-or-minus-3-percent-think-7-instead.html\">margin of error</a>. The fact that this new poll shows Harris tied with Trump (within the margin of error) while a poll in September showed that Harris was leading Trump (also within the margin of error) might signal that the Harris honeymoon is officially over, but ultimately, it\u2019s not that big a deal. You can scrutinise the numbers ad infinitum, but when it comes down to it, the truth is that nobody knows what is going to happen in November other than it\u2019s (probably) going to be very close. Polls are basically astrology for political nerds at this point.</p> <p>Speaking of which, professional astrologers have their own murky methods for predicting the outcome of elections and they seem just as confused as everyone else. Laurie Rivers, a political analyst turned astrologer with more than 235,000 TikTok followers, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/09/09/astrologers-are-predicting-the-result-of-americas-election\">told the Economist</a> she sees Harris winning \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d.

(That sign did not belong to me, but I share the sentiment.) In short: a giant meteor has a better chance of winning my little stretch of Philadelphia than Trump. What does this mean?

And, also, that I might be on some kind of neighbourhood watch list now because I peered into so many strangers\u2019 windows.</p> <p>We\u2019ll call the next experiment the Rascal Eats a Treat poll.

At first I thought that meant my dog was a savant trapped in a chihuahua\u2019s scruffy little body. Then, of course, I realised Rascal could smell the difference between the treats and simply preferred one artificial flavour to the other.

Wait, it looks like Kamala Harris is up by five points. Yikes, now Trump is up by one-nineteenth of a point. Now, according to a much discussed NBC News poll that came out on Sunday, Trump and Harris are neck and neck. As the US election draws closer, I have developed a severe case of poll-tigue. Can we just give the damn things a rest already? As we all know, polling is an inexact science at the best of times. More importantly, pretty much all the results of recent Trump-Harris polls have been within the margin of error. The fact that this new poll shows Harris tied with Trump (within the margin of error) while a poll in September showed that Harris was leading Trump (also within the margin of error) might signal that the Harris honeymoon is officially over, but ultimately, it\u2019s not that big a deal. You can scrutinise the numbers ad infinitum, but when it comes down to it, the truth is that nobody knows what is going to happen in November other than it\u2019s (probably) going to be very close. Polls are basically astrology for political nerds at this point. Speaking of which, professional astrologers have their own murky methods for predicting the outcome of elections and they seem just as confused as everyone else.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has reportedly offered assurances to the White House that its retaliation against Iran for its missile attack at the start of October would not target oil export terminals or nuclear facilities, which could send market prices soaring. The reports, which first appeared in the Washington Post, have helped to calm fears in the market and helped to fuel an oil price slide from almost $78 a barrel at the start of the week to below $74 on Tuesday. Oil prices have whipsawed in response to escalating tensions in the Middle East, reaching highs of just over $80 a barrel earlier this month, but still remain well below its near-$82.50 average last year. Weaker than expected global oil demand this year owing to a slowdown in China\u2019s economy has driven the decline, which worsened recently amid concerns that Beijing\u2019s recent fiscal measures will not be enough to accelerate economic growth for the world\u2019s largest oil importer. Oil prices slumped further this week after a report from the Opec oil cartel and its allies, known collectively as Opec+, cut forecasts for the world\u2019s oil demand growth for 2024 and 2025 for the third consecutive month. The International Energy Agency (IEA) used its closely watched monthly oil report, published on Tuesday, to warn that the slowdown in oil demand and abundant supplies of crude could mean that the market was heading for a significant surplus in the new year. The Paris-based agency also assured the market that any interruption to Iran\u2019s oil exports could be absorbed because levels of oil in storage had reached more than 1.2bn barrels and that the spare production capacity among Opec+ countries was at historic highs. \u201cAs supply developments unfold, the IEA stands ready to act if necessary,\u201d the energy agency said. \u201cFor now, supply keeps flowing, and in the absence of a major disruption, the market is faced with a sizeable surplus in the new year.\u201d The IEA trimmed its forecast for world oil demand growth this year to 860,000 barrels a day, down 40,000 bpd from the previous forecast. For next year, it sees the world\u2019s oil demand expanding by 1m bpd which is about 50,000 higher than expected last month. The IEA has consistently warned that slower Chinese economic growth and a shift towards electric vehicles would spell weaker oil demand from the world\u2019s second largest economy. It expects Chinese demand to grow by only 150,000 bpd in 2024, after consumption dropped by 500,000 bpd in August compared with the same month last year, a fourth consecutive month of declines. \u201cChinese oil demand continues to undershoot expectations and is the principal drag on overall growth,\u201d the IEA said.",

      "body": "<p>Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is on course for a catastrophic financial loss of up to $200m (\u00a3153m) as its dismal box office run continues amid a stream of critical brickbats and poor audience ratings.</p> <p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/joker-folie-a-deux-lose-warner-bros-millions-box-office-flop-1236176479/\">According to a report in Variety</a>, industry analysts say Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is projected to earn a total of $65m at the North American box office, and around $215m elsewhere for a total of $280m \u2013 well below the estimated $300m the film cost to produce and promote. With revenue splits with cinemas factored in, Variety say that in fact the film needs to earn around $450m to break even, though producing studio Warner Bros say that the break-even figure is in fact $375m. In an effort to claw back revenue the film is headed for an early debut on home entertainment and streaming platforms on 29 October. Meanwhile the Rotten Tomatoes rating website has <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joker_folie_a_deux\">recorded an audience score of 32%</a>.</p> <p>As a result,<em> </em>industry sources, speaking to Variety, estimated the film could lose its producers between $125m and $200m. However a statement from Warner Bros disputed the accuracy of the figures, saying: \u201cAny estimates suggested by anonymous \u2018insiders\u2019 or \u2018rival executives\u2019 are grossly wrong and continues a trend where rumour is reported as fact.\u201d</p> <p>All this is in stark contrast to the reception given the first Joker film. With the same star, Joaquin Phoenix, and director Todd Phillips, Joker won the prestigious Golden Lion at the Venice film festival on its premiere in 2019 as well as winning the best actor Oscar for Phoenix; it was also a huge commercial success, earning $1.08bn at the global box office, including \u00a3335m in North America.</p> <p>Blame for Folie \u00e0 Deux\u2019s failure has been apportioned to a number of factors. The surprise success of the first film put Phillips, its director and co-writer, in a powerful position, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/joker-folie-a-deux-bombs-what-went-wrong-todd-phillips-1236170946/\">allowing him to reportedly ignore or bypass the demands made by DC Studios</a>, custodian of the Batman/Joker intellectual property. In retrospect, his decision to make Folie \u00e0 Deux into a musical co-starring Lady Gaga appears to have alienated the comic book fanbase, a vital section of the audience if a film is to be a major hit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/09/flopping-at-the-box-office-hated-by-the-critics-could-joker-folie-a-deux-possibly-be-any-worse\">Flopping at the box office, hated by the critics \u2013 could Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux possibly be any worse?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Charles Gant, box office editor of Screen International, says that Phillips may take the fall. \u201cThe mantra in Hollywood is always to offer audiences the same, but different. With Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, it seems like Todd Phillips offered the wrong kind of different. The core audience received the message that not only is the film very different from the first film, but also that people liked the first Joker for the wrong reasons. In general, people are not rushing to pay money to be be scolded. Whether or not that\u2019s a fair summary of what Folie \u00c0 Deux actually delivers has become irrelevant \u2013 it\u2019s the message fans have received.\u201d</p> <p>And although neither Joker film remotely resembles a conventional comic-book superhero movie, Hollywood is coming to terms with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/07/superhero-fatigue-joker-superman-james-gunn-week-in-geek\">\u201csuperhero fatigue\u201d</a>, as follow-ups to seemingly invulnerable characters and brands record disappointing figures. Films such as <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Aquaman-and-the-Lost-Kingdom-(2023)#tab=summary\">Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom ($434m worldwide)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Marvels-The-(2023)#tab=summary\">The Marvels ($200m worldwide)</a> have performed well below expectations \u2013 though conversely <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Deadpool-and-Wolverine-(2024)#tab=summary\">Deadpool and Wolverine (1.33bn)</a> exceeded them.</p> <p>The inflated cost of making the sequels also played a part, with Phoenix and Phillips earning a reported $20m each, and Lady Gaga $12m.</p> <p>Gant adds: \u201cThe film seems now trapped in a doom spiral. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/09/flopping-at-the-box-office-hated-by-the-critics-could-joker-folie-a-deux-possibly-be-any-worse\">Reports of its failure</a> are scaring off the broader audiences needed to reduce the flow of red ink on the balance sheet. Actually, Folie \u00e0 Deux has its fans, and among IMDb users who have rated it so far, 18% scored it 8, 9 or 10. Sure, it\u2019s a minority, but those scores don\u2019t quite gel with what has become a stigma of total failure.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2024 to clarify that the sum of $200m loss came from industry sources speaking to Variety. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is on course for a catastrophic financial loss of up to $200m (\u00a3153m) as its dismal box office run continues amid a stream of critical brickbats and poor audience ratings. According to a report in Variety, industry analysts say Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is projected to earn a total of $65m at the North American box office, and around $215m elsewhere for a total of $280m \u2013 well below the estimated $300m the film cost to produce and promote. With revenue splits with cinemas factored in, Variety say that in fact the film needs to earn around $450m to break even, though producing studio Warner Bros say that the break-even figure is in fact $375m. In an effort to claw back revenue the film is headed for an early debut on home entertainment and streaming platforms on 29 October. Meanwhile the Rotten Tomatoes rating website has recorded an audience score of 32%. As a result, industry sources, speaking to Variety, estimated the film could lose its producers between $125m and $200m. However a statement from Warner Bros disputed the accuracy of the figures, saying: \u201cAny estimates suggested by anonymous \u2018insiders\u2019 or \u2018rival executives\u2019 are grossly wrong and continues a trend where rumour is reported as fact.\u201d All this is in stark contrast to the reception given the first Joker film. With the same star, Joaquin Phoenix, and director Todd Phillips, Joker won the prestigious Golden Lion at the Venice film festival on its premiere in 2019 as well as winning the best actor Oscar for Phoenix; it was also a huge commercial success, earning $1.08bn at the global box office, including \u00a3335m in North America. Blame for Folie \u00e0 Deux\u2019s failure has been apportioned to a number of factors. The surprise success of the first film put Phillips, its director and co-writer, in a powerful position, allowing him to reportedly ignore or bypass the demands made by DC Studios, custodian of the Batman/Joker intellectual property. In retrospect, his decision to make Folie \u00e0 Deux into a musical co-starring Lady Gaga appears to have alienated the comic book fanbase, a vital section of the audience if a film is to be a major hit. Charles Gant, box office editor of Screen International, says that Phillips may take the fall. \u201cThe mantra in Hollywood is always to offer audiences the same, but different. With Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, it seems like Todd Phillips offered the wrong kind of different. The core audience received the message that not only is the film very different from the first film, but also that people liked the first Joker for the wrong reasons. In general, people are not rushing to pay money to be be scolded. Whether or not that\u2019s a fair summary of what Folie \u00c0 Deux actually delivers has become irrelevant \u2013 it\u2019s the message fans have received.\u201d And although neither Joker film remotely resembles a conventional comic-book superhero movie, Hollywood is coming to terms with \u201csuperhero fatigue\u201d, as follow-ups to seemingly invulnerable characters and brands record disappointing figures. Films such as Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom ($434m worldwide) and The Marvels ($200m worldwide) have performed well below expectations \u2013 though conversely Deadpool and Wolverine (1.33bn) exceeded them. The inflated cost of making the sequels also played a part, with Phoenix and Phillips earning a reported $20m each, and Lady Gaga $12m. Gant adds: \u201cThe film seems now trapped in a doom spiral. Reports of its failure are scaring off the broader audiences needed to reduce the flow of red ink on the balance sheet. Actually, Folie \u00e0 Deux has its fans, and among IMDb users who have rated it so far, 18% scored it 8, 9 or 10. Sure, it\u2019s a minority, but those scores don\u2019t quite gel with what has become a stigma of total failure.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2024 to clarify that the sum of $200m loss came from industry sources speaking to Variety.",

      "body": "<p>When Project 2025 began making headlines this summer, it was largely for the ways the conservative \u201cwish list\u201d of policies for a future Trump administration would restructure the entire federal bureaucracy, deepen abortion restrictions and eliminate the Department of Education.</p> <p>But the document \u2013 a proposed mandate for the next Republican president authored by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank \u2013 also outlines steps that would radically transform food and farming, curtailing recent progress to address the excess of ultra-processed foods in the United States. Among those: weakening the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), ending policies that consider the effects of climate change \u2013 and eliminating the US dietary guidelines.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a deregulatory agenda,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food policy at New York University. \u201cAnd what we know historically from deregulation is that it\u2019s really bad for consumers, it\u2019s bad for workers, it\u2019s bad for the environment.\u201d</p> <p>Project 2025 proposes changes to the country\u2019s food assistance programs, like Snap and the Women, Infants and Children supplemental nutrition program (Wic), that Nestle believes are intended to dismantle such programs. It also calls for ending support for school meals.</p> <p>But one of the most notable of its proposals is calling on the next Republican president to eliminate or reform the dietary guidelines. Those guidelines form the basis for all federal food policies, from school meals to Snap, Wic and other programs.</p>    <p>\u201cThere is no shortage of private-sector dietary advice for the public, and nutrition and dietary choices are best left to individuals to address their personal needs,\u201d the document reads.</p> <p>The food industry has long pushed the idea that chronic, diet-related health conditions, like diabetes and obesity, are the result of individual choices \u2013 like not exercising enough. Today, nearly 42% of adults in the US are obese and about 12% have diabetes.

      "bodyText": "When Project 2025 began making headlines this summer, it was largely for the ways the conservative \u201cwish list\u201d of policies for a future Trump administration would restructure the entire federal bureaucracy, deepen abortion restrictions and eliminate the Department of Education. But the document \u2013 a proposed mandate for the next Republican president authored by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank \u2013 also outlines steps that would radically transform food and farming, curtailing recent progress to address the excess of ultra-processed foods in the United States. Among those: weakening the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), ending policies that consider the effects of climate change \u2013 and eliminating the US dietary guidelines. \u201cThis is a deregulatory agenda,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food policy at New York University. \u201cAnd what we know historically from deregulation is that it\u2019s really bad for consumers, it\u2019s bad for workers, it\u2019s bad for the environment.\u201d Project 2025 proposes changes to the country\u2019s food assistance programs, like Snap and the Women, Infants and Children supplemental nutrition program (Wic), that Nestle believes are intended to dismantle such programs. It also calls for ending support for school meals. But one of the most notable of its proposals is calling on the next Republican president to eliminate or reform the dietary guidelines. Those guidelines form the basis for all federal food policies, from school meals to Snap, Wic and other programs. \u201cThere is no shortage of private-sector dietary advice for the public, and nutrition and dietary choices are best left to individuals to address their personal needs,\u201d the document reads. The food industry has long pushed the idea that chronic, diet-related health conditions, like diabetes and obesity, are the result of individual choices \u2013 like not exercising enough. Today, nearly 42% of adults in the US are obese and about 12% have diabetes. But nutritionists emphasize that those conditions are not the result of a moral failing, but rather conditions caused by the ingredients and policies (like aggressively advertising to children) pushed by food companies. Nestle sees that as one of many pro-business policies outlined in Project 2025\u2019s agricultural provisions that trusts companies to prioritize public health over profit. \u201cThere\u2019s twice as many calories available in the food supply as the country needs on average.

She discusses it with family and friends because of the intensity of hurricanes like Milton and Helene, which have ravaged the southern US, she says. \u201cIt just seems like it\u2019s affecting more people every day.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s one reason why she is glad that UC San Diego has implemented an innovative graduation requirement for students starting this autumn: a course in climate change. Courses must cover at least 30% climate-related content and address two of four areas, including scientific foundations, human impacts, mitigation strategies and project-based learning. About 7,000 students from the class of 2028 will be affected this year.</p> <p>\u201cThe most important thing is that UC San Diego wants to make sure we\u2019re preparing students for the future that they really will encounter,\u201d says Sarah Gille, a physical oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who was part of the committee to create the new plan.</p> <p>The requirement won\u2019t add any time to a student\u2019s graduation schedule \u2013 it\u2019s designed to be integrated into existing classwork. Forty one-quarter courses meet the goal, including \u201cThe Astronomy of Climate Change\u201d, \u201cGender and Climate Justice\u201d, \u201cIndigenous Approaches to Climate Change\u201d and \u201cEnvironmentalism in Arts and Media\u201d. Many of the classes that fall under the climate requirement overlap with courses that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, the school says.</p> <p>Gille says students are positive about the requirement, which aims to prepare them for future climate-related policies and career opportunities.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re acutely aware as a society of how the climate is changing and how scary that can be, and that probably means that we need to implement some changes in how we do things,\u201d says Gille. \u201cIf they\u2019re thinking about the future, they need to be prepared for what the future might bring.\u201d That could mean new opportunities in climate-adjacent fields such as carbon accounting or civil engineering with a climate focus.</p> <p>Gille says she can stand in front of a class and talk about what the world might look like in 50 or 100 years in terms of temperature increase or sea level rise \u2013 \u201ca pretty demoralizing lesson\u201d \u2013 but when she ties it to strategic decisions students can make about their own lives, and how to pursue opportunities in the future, \u201cit can become an empowering lesson too\u201d.</p> <p>The move mirrors a larger sentiment in society. According to a Marist poll this year, <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/big-generational-differences-on-legal-weed-climate-change-and-health-care/\">85% of gen Z</a> is very or somewhat concerned about the climate crisis. They are more likely to believe the climate crisis is caused \u201cmostly by human activity\u201d than any other generation. And states from <a href=\"https://ncse.ngo/legislation-support-climate-change-education-enacted-california\">California</a> to Connecticut and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/08/20/1191114786/new-jersey-requires-climate-change-education-a-year-in-heres-how-its-going\">New Jersey</a> are now requiring that kids learn about the climate crisis in grade school classrooms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/21/louisiana-state-university-oil-firms-influence\">Louisiana\u2019s flagship university lets oil firms influence research \u2013 for a price</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arizona State University has also implemented a new <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/academic-life/2024/08/01/sustainability-course-major-requirement-asu\">sustainability requirement for graduation</a> this year. Universities such as Columbia, Harvard and Stanford are taking the climate focus a step further and have created entire schools devoted to the issue.</p> <p>Marcello Ametrano, a communications major and marine science minor, says that even as a non-science student, he\u2019s interested in keeping up to date on the latest science. \u201cIt\u2019s really opening my eyes to a lot of what\u2019s going on right now, especially with Hurricane Milton, and why it\u2019s so devastating,\u201d he says. Understanding the oceans is key: \u201cThe ocean is kind of saving us from it being so much worse, because it absorbs so much carbon dioxide. So it\u2019s really important to understand the ocean because it directly relates to climate change and essentially what\u2019s going on right now in Florida.\u201d</p> <p>A wider rollout of climate change courses for graduation is possible across the vast, statewide University of California system, but the school is first focusing on its own plan. \u201cThe important thing for UC San Diego was to do what made sense for our campus and to see how this requirement is adopted,\u201d Gille says. \u201cIf we can do something that\u2019s bigger, we can potentially create a generation of college graduates who are better prepared for the future.\u201d</p>",

Forty one-quarter courses meet the goal, including \u201cThe Astronomy of Climate Change\u201d, \u201cGender and Climate Justice\u201d, \u201cIndigenous Approaches to Climate Change\u201d and \u201cEnvironmentalism in Arts and Media\u201d. Many of the classes that fall under the climate requirement overlap with courses that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, the school says. Gille says students are positive about the requirement, which aims to prepare them for future climate-related policies and career opportunities. \u201cWe\u2019re acutely aware as a society of how the climate is changing and how scary that can be, and that probably means that we need to implement some changes in how we do things,\u201d says Gille. \u201cIf they\u2019re thinking about the future, they need to be prepared for what the future might bring.\u201d That could mean new opportunities in climate-adjacent fields such as carbon accounting or civil engineering with a climate focus. Gille says she can stand in front of a class and talk about what the world might look like in 50 or 100 years in terms of temperature increase or sea level rise \u2013 \u201ca pretty demoralizing lesson\u201d \u2013 but when she ties it to strategic decisions students can make about their own lives, and how to pursue opportunities in the future, \u201cit can become an empowering lesson too\u201d. The move mirrors a larger sentiment in society. According to a Marist poll this year, 85% of gen Z is very or somewhat concerned about the climate crisis. They are more likely to believe the climate crisis is caused \u201cmostly by human activity\u201d than any other generation. And states from California to Connecticut and New Jersey are now requiring that kids learn about the climate crisis in grade school classrooms. Arizona State University has also implemented a new sustainability requirement for graduation this year. Universities such as Columbia, Harvard and Stanford are taking the climate focus a step further and have created entire schools devoted to the issue. Marcello Ametrano, a communications major and marine science minor, says that even as a non-science student, he\u2019s interested in keeping up to date on the latest science. \u201cIt\u2019s really opening my eyes to a lot of what\u2019s going on right now, especially with Hurricane Milton, and why it\u2019s so devastating,\u201d he says. Understanding the oceans is key: \u201cThe ocean is kind of saving us from it being so much worse, because it absorbs so much carbon dioxide. So it\u2019s really important to understand the ocean because it directly relates to climate change and essentially what\u2019s going on right now in Florida.\u201d A wider rollout of climate change courses for graduation is possible across the vast, statewide University of California system, but the school is first focusing on its own plan. \u201cThe important thing for UC San Diego was to do what made sense for our campus and to see how this requirement is adopted,\u201d Gille says. \u201cIf we can do something that\u2019s bigger, we can potentially create a generation of college graduates who are better prepared for the future.\u201d",

Letby was heard discussing in an \u201cexcited\u201d way the death of two triplet babies in 24 hours in June 2016. Nicola Lightfoot, the deputy children\u2019s ward manager at the Countess of Chester hospital, said she heard Letby say in an animated way to a colleague immediately after the second death: \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what just happened.\u201d Lightfoot said: \u201cIt was like she was talking about some exciting event she had seen or witnessed on the unit \u2026 it wasn\u2019t an appropriate response to the death of a child.

Another nurse, Melanie Taylor, told the Thirlwall inquiry last week how Letby had discussed a child\u2019s death with her in an \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cgossipy\u201d way that she found unusual. The inquiry at Liverpool town hall is investigating the events surrounding the murder of seven babies and attempted murder of seven other newborns for which Letby, now 34, has been convicted. Giving evidence on Tuesday, Lightfoot described how she mentored Letby in her final placement as a student nurse in 2011 and failed her due to concerns about her competency. The deputy manager said she was \u201cconcerned about her interaction, how she communicated \u2013 I felt it was lacking\u201d and that \u201cher clinical knowledge wasn\u2019t where it should be\u201d. She added: \u201cI found Letby to be quite cold. I didn\u2019t find a natural warmth exuding from her that I expect from a children\u2019s nurse.\u201d Another of Letby\u2019s mentors, Sarah Jayne Murphy, said in a written statement that she found that Letby \u201cdid not show good interpersonal skills with parents\u201d, and she and other staff found her \u201cawkward and quiet\u201d. Murphy said it was unusual for a student nurse to fail their final placement and that Letby appealed against her fail, claiming there had been a \u201cclash of personalities\u201d between her and Lightfoot. Murphy said Letby went on to graduate successfully from her student training after completing the three competencies that she had previously failed. Lightfoot told the inquiry that a resident doctor said: \u201cI see Nurse Death\u2019s on again,\u201d when the second triplet died in June 2016 as part of \u201cgossip\u201d linking Letby with the high mortality rate. By that time a group of consultant paediatricians had connected the nurse to the \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cunexplained\u201d deaths of seven newborns and a number of near fatal deteriorations. Letby, from Hereford, was removed from the neonatal unit in July 2016 when senior doctors urged executives to contact the police. Instead, the hospital\u2019s medical director, Ian Harvey, ordered two independent investigations into the causes of the unusual incidents before contacting the police nearly a year later, in May 2017. Letby remained employed by the Countess of Chester hospital in a non-clinical role until her first arrest in July 2018, the inquiry has heard. Another medic, referred to as Nurse ZC, said on Monday that she mentioned the connection between Letby and the unusual deaths to Lightfoot in June 2016 and asked: \u201cIs it not concerning?\u201d Nurse ZC said Lightfoot \u201cshrugged her shoulders\u201d at the comment and Nurse ZC did not hear anything further.

This survey of recent textile-related work by artists based in the UK takes an expansive view, including a ceramic relief by <a href=\"https://www.hauserwirth.com/viewing-room/paloma-proudfoot/\">Paloma Proudfoot</a> for which she has sliced slabs of clay like a pattern cutter, and a vast machine by <a href=\"https://hollyhendry.com/work\">Holly Hendry</a> that processes a turning loop of images rendered in textile-backed silicone.</p> <p>This appealing and dynamic show favours substantial works and gives them plenty of space. A focal corner is occupied by Phyllida Barlow\u2019s towering untitled: canvasracks. From a distance, it suggests a huddle of giant children playing at ghosts beneath colourful sheets. Close up, each sheet turns out to be a painted canvas, suspended from their corners on poles moored in concrete cylinders \u2013 they\u2019re like uninscribed banners waiting for protest, or old signs with the text washed off. Barlow sneakily muddies the whole idea of textile art as a distinct genre. Behind most oil paintings is a similar sheet of fabric on a wooden stretcher.</p>    <p>There\u2019s welcome wit and light-heartedness. A dramatic hanging in geometric black and white by <a href=\"https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/artists/26-alexandre-da-cunha/works/\">Alexandre da Cunha</a> trails on to the gallery floor. Look closely, and its fluttery fabric panels turn out to be nylon umbrella canopies lifted off their frames. A nearby photograph by <a href=\"https://www.stephenfriedman.com/artists/28-tonico-lemos-auad/\">Tonico Lemos Auad</a> of a reclining fox documents a sculpture made of carpet fluff stabilised with hairspray. This is art made from the stuff of our everyday \u2013 da Cunha renders spectacular beauty from cheap and mass-produced objects, while Lemos Auad forms dreamy landscapes from waste materials.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/may/31/marc-camille-chaimowicz-obituary\">Marc Camille Chaimowicz</a>, too, makes the familiar strange, creating hybrid objects and extending the realm of fine art into the apparent banality of home decor. Against a panel of grandiose pink wallpaper, two identical seats stand, one performing as a chaise longue, the other as an upright chair. Thinking of the natural tendency to look for pictures in patterned wallpaper, the whole arrangement suggests a freakish psychoanalyst\u2019s office, in which the roles of analyst and analysand can switch back and forth in a setting primed to provoke the most delirious revelations. Even the single coat hook screwed into the wall looks possessed.</p> <p>Achaintre\u2019s own work HEL (2023) is a great monstrous thing, like a multicoloured pelt strung to the wall.

The shoes are \u201cpre-consumer waste\u201d \u2013 new but unsold inventory, potentially destined for destruction \u2013 arising from the garment industry\u2019s toxic addiction to overproduction. Fashion has an amazing ability to repackage dissent as a commodity. These tall, clumpy, lashed-together sculptures were made in 2021-22 and look weirdly like the \u00a31,000 clumpy, lashed-together Balenciaga sneakers worn at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/10/frieze-london-art-fair-penguins\">Frieze art fair last week</a>.</p> <p>Both <a href=\"https://camdenartcentre.org/whats-on/jonathan-baldock?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgrO4BhC2ARIsAKQ7zUlhon9S6laYhlgitxULbJsqnh9F1bP_v-4EnDzQ94lS9zXOIP_rcBgaAv2HEALw_wcB\">Jonathan Baldock</a> and<a href=\"https://www.zadiexa.com/\"> Zadie Xa</a> have created costumes suggesting a contemporary appropriation of folk rituals \u2013 his from Britain, hers from Korea. Xa\u2019s hooded coat is embroidered with iridescent patches, pictures of kimchi, yin-yang symbols and skeins of artificial hair. Baldock\u2019s paired processional sculptures The Caretakers are decorated with botanical emblems. A long veil covers the face (though a peephole has been stitched at genital level) and a second decorative head appears at an elevated position on a headpiece.</p> <p>What bodies are present have been taken apart. Anna Perach\u2019s Anatomical Venus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/feb/02/anna-perach-holes-review-gasworks-london\">(reviewed when it was shown at Gasworks)</a> is a sculpture of a female body made in tufted Axminster with demountable glass and leather body parts. The long silicone strip running through the metal rollers of Hendry\u2019s shiny machine carry images lifted from anatomical illustrations, as though human material has been thinned down to two dimensions. Most gruesome of all is Proudfoot\u2019s The Mannequins Reply, in which glazed ceramic female figures stitch one another into garments over exposed muscle.</p> <p>Textile\u2019s great appeal is its familiarity \u2013 this is stuff we wear next to our skin. Material Worlds invites us to see it as an extension of the body, and to ponder what lies beneath.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/material-worlds-contemporary-artists-and-textiles/\">Material Worlds: Contemporary Artists and Textiles is at Mead Gallery, Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry until 15 December, then touring</a></p>",

The Hayward Gallery touring show Material Worlds \u2013 recently opened at the Mead Gallery in Coventry \u2013 is curated by Caroline Achaintre, an artist known for her tufted fibre wall-hangings. This survey of recent textile-related work by artists based in the UK takes an expansive view, including a ceramic relief by Paloma Proudfoot for which she has sliced slabs of clay like a pattern cutter, and a vast machine by Holly Hendry that processes a turning loop of images rendered in textile-backed silicone. This appealing and dynamic show favours substantial works and gives them plenty of space. A focal corner is occupied by Phyllida Barlow\u2019s towering untitled: canvasracks. From a distance, it suggests a huddle of giant children playing at ghosts beneath colourful sheets. Close up, each sheet turns out to be a painted canvas, suspended from their corners on poles moored in concrete cylinders \u2013 they\u2019re like uninscribed banners waiting for protest, or old signs with the text washed off. Barlow sneakily muddies the whole idea of textile art as a distinct genre. Behind most oil paintings is a similar sheet of fabric on a wooden stretcher. There\u2019s welcome wit and light-heartedness. A dramatic hanging in geometric black and white by Alexandre da Cunha trails on to the gallery floor. Look closely, and its fluttery fabric panels turn out to be nylon umbrella canopies lifted off their frames. A nearby photograph by Tonico Lemos Auad of a reclining fox documents a sculpture made of carpet fluff stabilised with hairspray. This is art made from the stuff of our everyday \u2013 da Cunha renders spectacular beauty from cheap and mass-produced objects, while Lemos Auad forms dreamy landscapes from waste materials. Marc Camille Chaimowicz, too, makes the familiar strange, creating hybrid objects and extending the realm of fine art into the apparent banality of home decor. Against a panel of grandiose pink wallpaper, two identical seats stand, one performing as a chaise longue, the other as an upright chair. Thinking of the natural tendency to look for pictures in patterned wallpaper, the whole arrangement suggests a freakish psychoanalyst\u2019s office, in which the roles of analyst and analysand can switch back and forth in a setting primed to provoke the most delirious revelations. Even the single coat hook screwed into the wall looks possessed. Achaintre\u2019s own work HEL (2023) is a great monstrous thing, like a multicoloured pelt strung to the wall. Gaping holes give it the appearance of a vast tormented insect mask without diminishing its fluffy appeal. Hendrickje Schimmel (who works under the name Tenant of Culture) makes compellingly ugly sculptures out of ripped apart and restacked shoe parts. The shoes are \u201cpre-consumer waste\u201d \u2013 new but unsold inventory, potentially destined for destruction \u2013 arising from the garment industry\u2019s toxic addiction to overproduction. Fashion has an amazing ability to repackage dissent as a commodity. These tall, clumpy, lashed-together sculptures were made in 2021-22 and look weirdly like the \u00a31,000 clumpy, lashed-together Balenciaga sneakers worn at Frieze art fair last week. Both Jonathan Baldock and Zadie Xa have created costumes suggesting a contemporary appropriation of folk rituals \u2013 his from Britain, hers from Korea. Xa\u2019s hooded coat is embroidered with iridescent patches, pictures of kimchi, yin-yang symbols and skeins of artificial hair. Baldock\u2019s paired processional sculptures The Caretakers are decorated with botanical emblems. A long veil covers the face (though a peephole has been stitched at genital level) and a second decorative head appears at an elevated position on a headpiece. What bodies are present have been taken apart. Anna Perach\u2019s Anatomical Venus (reviewed when it was shown at Gasworks) is a sculpture of a female body made in tufted Axminster with demountable glass and leather body parts. The long silicone strip running through the metal rollers of Hendry\u2019s shiny machine carry images lifted from anatomical illustrations, as though human material has been thinned down to two dimensions. Most gruesome of all is Proudfoot\u2019s The Mannequins Reply, in which glazed ceramic female figures stitch one another into garments over exposed muscle. Textile\u2019s great appeal is its familiarity \u2013 this is stuff we wear next to our skin. Material Worlds invites us to see it as an extension of the body, and to ponder what lies beneath. \u2022 Material Worlds: Contemporary Artists and Textiles is at Mead Gallery, Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry until 15 December, then touring",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Nancy Pelosi has said she has not yet spoken to Joe Biden since she urged him to drop out of the presidential race following his calamitous performance in a debate against Donald Trump in June. The former House speaker told the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly America podcast that despite respecting Biden as a longtime political ally and a friend, she felt the need to intervene. \u201cElections are decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cYou decide to win. I decided a while ago that Donald Trump will never set foot in the White House again as president of the United States or in any other capacity.\u201d Asked if she had spoken to Biden since her intervention, she said: \u201cNot since then, no. But I\u2019m prayerful about it.\u201d What else did Pelosi say? She compared Trump\u2019s name to a swearword, saying: \u201cI hardly ever say his name\u201d and instead describing him as \u201cwhat\u2019s-his-name\u201d. Harris calls Trump a \u2018risk for America\u2019, after former president\u2019s \u2018enemy within\u2019 remarks Kamala Harris has described Trump as \u201cincreasingly unstable and unhinged\u201d and said re-electing him would be \u201ca huge risk for America\u201d after her opponent threatened to use US armed forces against those he has termed \u201cthe enemy within\u201d. At a Harris rally in the swing state of Pennsylvania, the US vice-president showed a montage of Trump videos, including of him saying \u201cthose people are more dangerous \u2013 the enemy from within \u2013 than Russia\u201d to paint him as a threat to democracy. The Trump quote came from a speech at a California rally on Saturday. Her campaign has also released a new campaign advert focused on Trump\u2019s increasingly authoritarian rhetoric, featuring warnings from two former members of his presidential administration about the danger Trump would pose if re-elected. What did the former Trump administration members say? Olivia Troye, a one-time national security adviser to Mike Pence, said: \u201cI do remember the day that he suggested that we shoot people on the streets.\u201d Kevin Carroll, a former senior counsel, added: \u201cThere will be no stopping his worst instincts \u2026 If we elect Trump again, we\u2019re in terrible danger.\u201d About 80% of countries fail to submit plans to preserve nature ahead of global summit With just a week to go until the biodiversity summit in Colombia, more than 80% of countries have not submitted plans to meet a UN agreement to prevent the destruction of Earth\u2019s ecosystems. The historic deal, struck nearly two years ago in Montreal, Canada, included targets to ringfence 30% of land and sea for nature, reform environmentally harmful subsidies worth billions of dollars and cut pesticide usage. But with Cop16 beginning on 21 October, only 25 countries have submitted their plans for action. Who has submitted plans? Only five of the 17 megadiverse countries \u2013 which host about 70% of the planet\u2019s biodiversity \u2013 produced plans: Australia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mexico. Suriname was the only Amazon rainforest nation to submit a plan, and no Congo Basin nation did so. And the G7? Canada, Italy, France and Japan were the only G7 nations to meet the deadline. In other news \u2026 Canadian police on Monday accused Indian diplomats and consular staff of \u201ccriminal\u201d activities including homicides in the country, hours after senior diplomats were expelled from both countries. Israeli strikes killed at least 40 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, while another Israeli strike killed more than 20 people in northern Lebanon. Google will buy nuclear energy to power the datacenters used for artificial intelligence in a \u201cworld first\u201d deal. Dozens of human rights groups have urged the Polish prime minister against temporarily suspending the right to asylum in the country. Stat of the day: new cervical cancer treatment plan \u2018cuts risk of dying from disease by 40%\u2019 A new way of treating cervical cancer \u2013 the fourth most common cancer in women globally \u2013 slashes the chance of dying from the disease by 40%. It\u2019s being hailed as the biggest advancement in treatment this century, after patients in a 10-year trial were given the short course of chemotherapy before chemoradiation (combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Don\u2019t miss this: the exhausting rise of sleep perfectionism If you ask people who sleep through the night how they do it, usually the answer is simple: they do nothing. But try telling that to those caught up in the world of orthosomnia \u2013 the term for an obsession with getting the perfect night\u2019s rest, usually while wearing a tracking device. It\u2019s a growing industry that experts warn could be counterproductive, with some feeling anxious about not achieving a good enough \u201cperformance\u201d while misunderstanding the science behind sleep. Climate check: what happens to the world if forests stop absorbing carbon? Ask Finland Scientists are warning that last year the ability of the planet\u2019s land and trees to absorb CO2 was dramatically reduced, almost to zero. Land sinks are a huge part of the path to net zero, and most climate modeling has not accounted for this, meaning global heating could be more extreme than expected if this continues. Patrick Greenfield looks at the consequences in Finland, where the country\u2019s forest sink has declined rapidly over a decade \u2013 meaning its land is now a net contributor to global heating. Last Thing: cheating alleged after men\u2019s world conker champion found with steel chestnut Swirling rumors and vicious allegations are dividing \u2026 the World Conker Championships. An investigation has been launched after the 82-year-old winner of the game \u2013 in which opponents strike each other\u2019s horse chestnut until one breaks \u2013 was found with a metal replica in his pocket.

      "body": "<p>The arts community in Asheville, North Carolina, is piecing itself together in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.</p> <p>In the River Arts District, artwork was destroyed, and the buildings that once housed studios and galleries are mud-caked or crumbling. As they face the immediate challenge of survival, the community now wonders if what it once had can ever be rebuilt from the ground up.</p> <p>On a recent Saturday morning, the painter <a href=\"https://www.riverartsdistrict.com/artist/elizabeth-porritt-carrington/\">Elizabeth Porritt Carrington</a> drove from her home in West Asheville to what she called her \u201cvillage\u201d \u2013 the RAD. It was once a colorful neighborhood of art galleries and restaurants, and a vital part of Asheville tourism.</p> <p>When Helene hit western North Carolina on 26 September, the French Broad River flooded; it <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/hurricane-helene-flooding-french-broad-river-asheville-north-carolina\">crested on 28 September at 24ft</a>, surpassing previous records.</p> <p>Water, debris and mud transformed the RAD into an apocalyptic Dr Seuss landscape \u2013 trees bent sideways, or fallen, plastic bags shredded to ribbons in the branches. Sheets of metal, like those from raised garden beds, are wrapped around the trunks. Mud puddles are thick, and passable only by ad hoc plywood bridges. Brown dust covers everything.</p> <p>Carrington approached <a href=\"https://riverviewstation.com/\">Riverview Station</a> that morning to visit her second-floor studio and gallery space; the 1902-era building was home to 60 artists. She came across eight art prints splayed out across the dusty grass.</p> <p>Water had seeped underneath the plastic coverings and warped cardboard and paper.</p> <p>Carrington realized six of those prints were her own works, being sold at <a href=\"https://www.tygertygergallery.com/\">Tyger Tyger Gallery</a> on Riverview Station\u2019s first floor, she said. Someone must have brought the works outside to dry in the sun.</p> <p>With her face covered in an N95 mask, Carrington peered through Tyger Tyger\u2019s dark, open front door.</p> <p>\u201cI believe one of my paintings is stuck up in the rafters in there,\u201d she commented.</p> <p>The Blue Ridge mountain town of Asheville is considered one of the south-east\u2019s top arts communities. Carrington is one of 300 or so working artists in the RAD. Her studio is on Riverview Station\u2019s second floor, and ahead of Helene, she thought: \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry at all.\u201d</p> <p>The gallerists at ArtPlace and Tyger Tyger did worry, though. Carrington was visiting family in County Clare, Ireland, when Helene hit. She estimated 80% of her work was saved because one gallerist moved her work to a higher floor, and another gathered up her paintings and delivered them to her home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Who is going to want to buy a painting that\u2019s been in 2ft of contaminated mud?</p> <footer> <cite>Elizabeth Porritt Carrington</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When floodwaters receded, artists like Carrington returned to the RAD to salvage artwork and belongings. Without power, Riverview Station was spooky: it was pitch black and muddy puddles filled the halls. Carrington was able to retrieve her most expensive oil paints, she said, as well as a laptop and camera.</p> <p>Sketchbooks that she has had since childhood were badly damaged by the floodwater. She was also able to retrieve some paintings. The ones hanging on the wall in her gallery were relatively unharmed; the ones that had been leaning on the floor in her studio were caked in mud.</p> <p>(When the Guardian visited, most everyone in the RAD heeded warnings about toxins in the mud and wore face masks and other PPE.) Some works ended up in a pile to be discarded.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you hose down an oil painting?\u201d Carrington asked. \u201cWho is going to want to buy a painting that\u2019s been in 2ft of contaminated mud?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Starting to rebuild</strong></h2> <p>Artists say it is too early, and they are still too traumatized, to imagine how the RAD bounces back, but they recognize the rebuild will be different. Many of the older industrial buildings with cheap rents that attracted artists to the RAD in the first place have literally crumbled.</p> <p>\u201cIt is overwhelming to think what it would take to have the River Arts District be what it was,\u201d the mixed media artist<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.bridgetbentonart.com/\">Bridget Benton</a> said. \u201cThe River Arts District was something completely unique.\u201d</p> <p>The RAD\u2019s building owners were dedicated to providing affordable studio space for working artists. Now, Benton worries that real estate development companies with the capital to clean and rebuild won\u2019t have that same dedication to affordability.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who are going to have the funds [are] going to expect a return on investment,\u201d said Benton, who added that she believed the RAD would return with \u201ca few big, shiny high-end galleries \u2026 The small makers are just not going to be able to afford it.\u201d</p> <p>Nikki Eldred, whose Chinese tea and elixir bar Asheville Dispensary opened in Marquee just one month ago, felt similarly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very fearful of land developers coming in grabbing the land, bulldozing everything and building things that don\u2019t hold the heart of Asheville,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to lean into that fear too much.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018How can we begin to generate revenue?\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Western North Carolina\u2019s leaf season brings <a href=\"https://ncnewsline.com/2024/10/04/hurricane-helene-tourism-industry/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt's%20a%20tragic%20situation.%E2%80%9D,billion%20in%20revenue%2C%20Tuttell%20said.\">billions in tourism dollars</a> into the region, but the governor, Roy Cooper, <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/10/03/nc-gov-cooper-to-tourists-after-helene-we-dont-want-you-here/75494195007/\">has implored tourists not to come</a>, given the inaccessibility of many roads and widespread water outages.</p> <p>Artists in the RAD now wonder how to recuperate losses from a canceled tourist season.</p> <p>\u201cHow can we begin to generate revenue?\u201d said Benton.</p> <p>310 Art, a fine art school where she was an instructor, is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DAt9ZFWBuY_/?img_index=1\">completely decimated</a>\u201d, she said. She hopes it will be able to temporarily relocate somewhere nearby.</p> <p>To generate an income, she envisions hosting collage nights or watercolor painting sessions (\u201cWe did a lot of that during the beginnings of Covid,\u201d she said).</p> <p>The gallery <a href=\"https://artplay-studio.com/\">ArtPlay</a> posted all the work it displayed online, with 75% of funds raised going immediately to the artists. Carrington said she had sold one $600 piece through ArtPlay\u2019s sale. But online sales have never been a strong interest of hers.</p> <p>\u201cI was really dependent on the RAD and the galleries I was in,\u201d she said.</p> <p>There is also a pressure to seize the moment when the storm\u2019s destruction is in the news.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody is, like \u2018why don\u2019t you have a GoFundMe page up yet?\u2019\u201d Benton said. \u201cThere is the feeling that if we don\u2019t do the fundraising now, nobody is going to care a week from now.\u201d</p> <p>Carrington aspired to build out her online presence in the fall. Now, that\u2019s a necessity.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to completely change what I\u2019m doing and start over,\u201d she said. \u201cI imagine I will, and I trust myself to do that.

Sheets of metal, like those from raised garden beds, are wrapped around the trunks. Mud puddles are thick, and passable only by ad hoc plywood bridges. Brown dust covers everything. Carrington approached Riverview Station that morning to visit her second-floor studio and gallery space; the 1902-era building was home to 60 artists. She came across eight art prints splayed out across the dusty grass. Water had seeped underneath the plastic coverings and warped cardboard and paper. Carrington realized six of those prints were her own works, being sold at Tyger Tyger Gallery on Riverview Station\u2019s first floor, she said. Someone must have brought the works outside to dry in the sun. With her face covered in an N95 mask, Carrington peered through Tyger Tyger\u2019s dark, open front door. \u201cI believe one of my paintings is stuck up in the rafters in there,\u201d she commented. The Blue Ridge mountain town of Asheville is considered one of the south-east\u2019s top arts communities. Carrington is one of 300 or so working artists in the RAD. Her studio is on Riverview Station\u2019s second floor, and ahead of Helene, she thought: \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry at all.\u201d The gallerists at ArtPlace and Tyger Tyger did worry, though. Carrington was visiting family in County Clare, Ireland, when Helene hit. She estimated 80% of her work was saved because one gallerist moved her work to a higher floor, and another gathered up her paintings and delivered them to her home. When floodwaters receded, artists like Carrington returned to the RAD to salvage artwork and belongings. Without power, Riverview Station was spooky: it was pitch black and muddy puddles filled the halls. Carrington was able to retrieve her most expensive oil paints, she said, as well as a laptop and camera. Sketchbooks that she has had since childhood were badly damaged by the floodwater. She was also able to retrieve some paintings. The ones hanging on the wall in her gallery were relatively unharmed; the ones that had been leaning on the floor in her studio were caked in mud. (When the Guardian visited, most everyone in the RAD heeded warnings about toxins in the mud and wore face masks and other PPE.) Some works ended up in a pile to be discarded. \u201cHow do you hose down an oil painting?\u201d Carrington asked. \u201cWho is going to want to buy a painting that\u2019s been in 2ft of contaminated mud?\u201d Starting to rebuild Artists say it is too early, and they are still too traumatized, to imagine how the RAD bounces back, but they recognize the rebuild will be different. Many of the older industrial buildings with cheap rents that attracted artists to the RAD in the first place have literally crumbled. \u201cIt is overwhelming to think what it would take to have the River Arts District be what it was,\u201d the mixed media artist Bridget Benton said. \u201cThe River Arts District was something completely unique.\u201d The RAD\u2019s building owners were dedicated to providing affordable studio space for working artists. Now, Benton worries that real estate development companies with the capital to clean and rebuild won\u2019t have that same dedication to affordability. \u201cThe people who are going to have the funds [are] going to expect a return on investment,\u201d said Benton, who added that she believed the RAD would return with \u201ca few big, shiny high-end galleries \u2026 The small makers are just not going to be able to afford it.\u201d Nikki Eldred, whose Chinese tea and elixir bar Asheville Dispensary opened in Marquee just one month ago, felt similarly. \u201cI\u2019m very fearful of land developers coming in grabbing the land, bulldozing everything and building things that don\u2019t hold the heart of Asheville,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to lean into that fear too much.\u201d \u2018How can we begin to generate revenue?\u2019 Western North Carolina\u2019s leaf season brings billions in tourism dollars into the region, but the governor, Roy Cooper, has implored tourists not to come, given the inaccessibility of many roads and widespread water outages. Artists in the RAD now wonder how to recuperate losses from a canceled tourist season. \u201cHow can we begin to generate revenue?\u201d said Benton. 310 Art, a fine art school where she was an instructor, is \u201ccompletely decimated\u201d, she said. She hopes it will be able to temporarily relocate somewhere nearby. To generate an income, she envisions hosting collage nights or watercolor painting sessions (\u201cWe did a lot of that during the beginnings of Covid,\u201d she said). The gallery ArtPlay posted all the work it displayed online, with 75% of funds raised going immediately to the artists. Carrington said she had sold one $600 piece through ArtPlay\u2019s sale. But online sales have never been a strong interest of hers. \u201cI was really dependent on the RAD and the galleries I was in,\u201d she said. There is also a pressure to seize the moment when the storm\u2019s destruction is in the news. \u201cEverybody is, like \u2018why don\u2019t you have a GoFundMe page up yet?\u2019\u201d Benton said. \u201cThere is the feeling that if we don\u2019t do the fundraising now, nobody is going to care a week from now.\u201d Carrington aspired to build out her online presence in the fall. Now, that\u2019s a necessity. \u201cI\u2019ve got to completely change what I\u2019m doing and start over,\u201d she said. \u201cI imagine I will, and I trust myself to do that. I don\u2019t know yet what it looks like.\u201d",

I mean, I am shocked, and shame on you.\u201d [see footnote]</p> <p>He fears Khan is being too cautious and continues to criticise him, even though Khan has sought arrest warrants for Netanyahu on the basis of imposing collective punishment and starvation. </p> <p>\u201cHe [Khan] did not meet us for two years, even though we are a treasure trove of evidence. I have told him in person that if the ICC had moved earlier, in 2015, 2020, 21 or 22, perhaps this would not have happened. The message Israel heard all along is that [it is] untouchable and above accountability. That has encouraged them to continue,\u201d Sourani said.</p> <p>He finds it ironic that Israeli lawyers now oppose Khan\u2019s request for arrest warrants on the grounds of complementarity \u2013 the principle that the ICC cannot take up a case until credible domestic legal avenues to redress have been exhausted.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI know the Israeli courts. Everyone used to say to me the Israel legal system, it\u2019s sophisticated, it\u2019s nice, it\u2019s independent. Try it. Yes, and we tried, thousands of cases \u2013 for instance against Israel\u2019s killing of 228 Palestinians during the Great March of Return in March 2018. It was then that we realised the limits of the Israeli legal system. Not just us, everyone concluded the Israeli system is genuinely unwilling and genuinely unable to deliver justice to Palestinians. Israel will never hold anyone accountable. It\u2019s mission impossible.\u201d</p> <p>On his own future, he said he had \u201cno right to surrender\u201d. He said: \u201cThey want us to give up. We do not have the luxury of choice. We have to call for the upholding of international law. It is the west\u2019s invention. But are we going to liberate Palestine with a court judgment? Never. We know our weight and volume. We are not replacing political parties. We are not replacing their role, but we are asking them to think what it means if Gaza becomes the graveyard of the law.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Footnote added 29 October 2024: the former ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo has told the Guardian he rejects the claim that he could not act in relation to Israel without US permission. He said he had \u201cnever asked permission [from] the US or any other country to fulfil my duties\u201d. We are happy to make this clear.</p>",

Sourani said he was aghast when the first ICC prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, told him he could not act against Israel without US permission. \u201cHe said \u2018I am a polite man\u2019 but I said to him you are meant to be the global guardian of international law, you are the legal conscience of victims across the globe, and you are telling me if the Americans do not give you the green light then you\u2019re not going to move anywhere? I mean, I am shocked, and shame on you.\u201d [see footnote] He fears Khan is being too cautious and continues to criticise him, even though Khan has sought arrest warrants for Netanyahu on the basis of imposing collective punishment and starvation. \u201cHe [Khan] did not meet us for two years, even though we are a treasure trove of evidence. I have told him in person that if the ICC had moved earlier, in 2015, 2020, 21 or 22, perhaps this would not have happened. The message Israel heard all along is that [it is] untouchable and above accountability. That has encouraged them to continue,\u201d Sourani said. He finds it ironic that Israeli lawyers now oppose Khan\u2019s request for arrest warrants on the grounds of complementarity \u2013 the principle that the ICC cannot take up a case until credible domestic legal avenues to redress have been exhausted. He said: \u201cI know the Israeli courts. Everyone used to say to me the Israel legal system, it\u2019s sophisticated, it\u2019s nice, it\u2019s independent. Try it. Yes, and we tried, thousands of cases \u2013 for instance against Israel\u2019s killing of 228 Palestinians during the Great March of Return in March 2018. It was then that we realised the limits of the Israeli legal system. Not just us, everyone concluded the Israeli system is genuinely unwilling and genuinely unable to deliver justice to Palestinians. Israel will never hold anyone accountable. It\u2019s mission impossible.\u201d On his own future, he said he had \u201cno right to surrender\u201d. He said: \u201cThey want us to give up. We do not have the luxury of choice. We have to call for the upholding of international law. It is the west\u2019s invention. But are we going to liberate Palestine with a court judgment? Never. We know our weight and volume. We are not replacing political parties. We are not replacing their role, but we are asking them to think what it means if Gaza becomes the graveyard of the law.\u201d \u2022 Footnote added 29 October 2024: the former ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo has told the Guardian he rejects the claim that he could not act in relation to Israel without US permission. He said he had \u201cnever asked permission [from] the US or any other country to fulfil my duties\u201d. We are happy to make this clear.",

In the 12 years of owning his restaurant on Palomino beach in the Guajira region on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia\">Colombia</a>\u2019s Caribbean coast, he has had to rebuild and move it 10 times because of rising sea levels and coastal erosion.</p> <p>Since last December alone, he has had to relocate four times; his rebuilt restaurant sits on an estuary where the Palomino River meets the Caribbean Sea. In recent years, two fellow restaurateurs have been forced to close due to damage caused by the erosion.</p> <p>\u201cWe are losing the beach very, very quickly. We are scared of rebuilding; it\u2019s worrisome to lose money again,\u201d Villamizar says, standing among his restaurant\u2019s red plastic tables crowded with customers. \u201cBut we must keep rebuilding and finding new ways to keep fighting, as much as the sea will let us, because this is our livelihood.\u201d</p>    <p>The entire coastline of Palomino, a laid-back beach town, is on the frontline of Colombia\u2019s battle against erosion.</p> <p>Storms and the relentless battering by the waves naturally contribute to the problem, but have been made worse by the rising sea level, a consequence of the climate crisis.

A former RAF airfield in Cambridgeshire and a fire service college in the Cotswolds have joined a chemicals plant in Lancashire and a fire protection equipment supplier in North Yorkshire on the agency\u2019s list of \u201cproblem sites\u201d for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). In total, according to a report compiled for the agency, there could be more than 10,000 locations in England contaminated with PFAS \u2013 substances that have been linked to a wide range of diseases including cancers, and which do not break down in the environment, earning them the nickname \u201cforever chemicals\u201d. But to date the agency is only taking action on four sites. Banned PFAS were widely used in firefighting foams, which could explain why the area around the former RAF base, now the Fire Service College in Moreton-in-Marsh in Gloucestershire is on the agency\u2019s \u201cproblem site\u201d list. Elevated concentrations of PFAS in the surface water are being investigated by the EA.

In an email sent to Defra in May, the agency says there are \u201cfunding pressures this year to take on all the inspection work we have been asked to do\u201d relating to \u201cPFAS and the two new potential site inspection requests we have accepted for AGC and Duxford\u201d. \u201cThese are the first requests we have had for many years and the very high cost of analysing for PFAS is beginning to get frightening,\u201d the agency wrote.

That\u2019s the first thing they do.\u201d While those on performance-based employment contracts could make an individual decision on their pay, for the rest of staff \u201cit\u2019s at the discretion of the whole community\u201d, Pintos-Lopez said. \u201cI think that every likelihood is our members will rally together and ask us as union leadership to forge a campaign and fight against the VC\u2019s proposal,\u201d Pintos-Lopez said. \u201cThe vice-chancellor and the university\u2019s popularity is plummeting,\u201d he said, adding that the 2020 decision to accept a change to the EA was taken amid the uncertainty of the Covid pandemic. A spokesperson for the ANU said: \u201cThis is a consultative process. We have presented a proposal to amend the academic structure, held town hall meetings with all staff and with each of the seven colleges, and are currently in the consultation period where staff can provide feedback on the proposals before final decisions are made.\u201d The NTEU\u2019s Monash branch president, Dr Ben Eltham, wrote on X: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on at ANU right now is quite extraordinary.\u201d \u201cANU made a $135m surplus last year and has billions of dollars of assets and reserves. Suddenly VC Genevieve Bell is declaring she needs to save $250m this year.\u201d Guardian Australia understands the surplus mentioned by Eltham is made up of investment income and insurance proceeds still being paid from a major hail storm in 2020, neither of which can be paid towards operating expenses such as wages. Guardian Australia also understands the university has a cumulative operating deficit of almost $400m over the past three years. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2024 to clarify that the vote of ANU staff at Wednesday\u2019s rally was indicative, rather than formal.",

Isn\u2019t this what dark money is for \u2013 setting up bot factories to disrupt democracies, and bulk-buying far-right trash to make it look more popular than it is? That might account for some of the sales, but there are enough real people to put real reviews on Amazon, and they\u2019re all a variation on the same thing: \u201cthe truth is all coming out\u201d; this is \u201cthe book the government do not want you to read\u201d; \u201cas long as there are people like Tommy, all is not lost\u201d; \u201cit unravels the web of lies we have been told for decades\u201d.</p> <p>There are some personal touches, such as \u201cit will sit on my shelf alongside works of Churchill, De Gaulle, Enoch Powell, Tom Holland and Douglas Murray, to name but a few\u201d. But generally speaking, it\u2019s the same sentiment, in very similar words: politics is a lie and the modern world is an elite conspiracy, hellbent on silencing, impoverishing and ultimately vanquishing the Indigenous peoples of the west. How it would help this nefarious elite to engineer a clash of civilisations is a bit unclear. But the argument has moved beyond the point at which a careful critique of its internal logic would deflate its adherents.</p> <p>Many argue that Amazon shouldn\u2019t have stocked the book in the first place. It had no problem removing Robinson\u2019s 2019 book, Mohammed\u2019s Koran: Why Muslims Kill for Islam (co-written, like Manifesto, with Peter McLoughlin), on the grounds that its content was \u201cinappropriate\u201d. And Manifesto, after last week\u2019s sales, is now unavailable, with the opaque message: \u201cWe don\u2019t know when or if this item will be back in stock.\u201d Amazon could have removed the book for its political outlook, or it could have run out of copies. Either way, Robinson\u2019s supporters will take that as proof of one of their arguments: that they are being silenced by a liberal conspiracy, or they are much more numerous than the world cares to admit.</p> <p>This question has been smouldering for years, igniting in a single event now and then \u2013 such as the appearance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/23/bnp-nick-griffin-question-time\">Nick Griffin, then leader of the British National Party, on Question Time</a> in 2009 \u2013 only to die back down, unresolved, unextinguished, and it is: what is society\u2019s duty, with the storytelling of the far right? Does it have to be aired, in order that it can be fought? If it\u2019s silenced, will it go away? Is it always better to know what bigots are thinking, rather than pretend they don\u2019t exist?</p> <p>The sheer length of this debate makes it feel familiar, but in fact this territory is not familiar. Having the great replacement theory at the top of the charts is a new world, where the argument about freedom of speech \u2013 whether it has to extend to hate speech, what hate speech means \u2013 is already over. </p> <ul> <li><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But generally speaking, it\u2019s the same sentiment, in very similar words: politics is a lie and the modern world is an elite conspiracy, hellbent on silencing, impoverishing and ultimately vanquishing the Indigenous peoples of the west. How it would help this nefarious elite to engineer a clash of civilisations is a bit unclear. But the argument has moved beyond the point at which a careful critique of its internal logic would deflate its adherents. Many argue that Amazon shouldn\u2019t have stocked the book in the first place. It had no problem removing Robinson\u2019s 2019 book, Mohammed\u2019s Koran: Why Muslims Kill for Islam (co-written, like Manifesto, with Peter McLoughlin), on the grounds that its content was \u201cinappropriate\u201d. And Manifesto, after last week\u2019s sales, is now unavailable, with the opaque message: \u201cWe don\u2019t know when or if this item will be back in stock.\u201d Amazon could have removed the book for its political outlook, or it could have run out of copies. Either way, Robinson\u2019s supporters will take that as proof of one of their arguments: that they are being silenced by a liberal conspiracy, or they are much more numerous than the world cares to admit. This question has been smouldering for years, igniting in a single event now and then \u2013 such as the appearance of Nick Griffin, then leader of the British National Party, on Question Time in 2009 \u2013 only to die back down, unresolved, unextinguished, and it is: what is society\u2019s duty, with the storytelling of the far right? Does it have to be aired, in order that it can be fought? If it\u2019s silenced, will it go away? Is it always better to know what bigots are thinking, rather than pretend they don\u2019t exist? The sheer length of this debate makes it feel familiar, but in fact this territory is not familiar. Having the great replacement theory at the top of the charts is a new world, where the argument about freedom of speech \u2013 whether it has to extend to hate speech, what hate speech means \u2013 is already over.

It still weighs practically nothing \u2013 3.3g to 5.2g depending on size \u2013 and comes in an expanded choice of 12 sizes and six finishes, including black, silver, gold and rose gold.</p> <p>But this level of sophistication doesn\u2019t come cheap, costing from \u00a3349 (\u20ac399/$349/A$569) and requiring a \u00a35.99 (\u20ac5.99/$5.99/A$9.99) a month subscription to access anything but basic daily metrics.</p>    <p>Inside of the new ring the three small sensor domes under your finger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/06/oura-gen-3-review-can-smart-ring-worn-by-celebs-and-athletes-work-for-you\">in the Gen 3</a> have been removed leaving two imperceptible bumps and array of dark windows flush to the surface. That makes it more comfortable to wear and much easier to get it on and off over knuckles.</p> <p>At 3mm thick the ring is still about twice the depth of a standard wedding band. But Oura says its improvements mean many of its users can go down a size compared with the Gen 3, which will help reduce its impact on adjacent fingers.</p> <p>Upgraded sensors allow the Oura to better adjust to your finger\u2019s shape, skin tone and orientation as the ring spins around it, increasing tracking accuracy and reducing gaps where it couldn\u2019t correctly detect a pulse or other metric.</p> <p>Some of the sensors can also be turned off when not needed, which helps extend battery life to just under six days between charges for the size eight Ring 4, which is about a day longer than the equivalent Gen 3.</p>    <p>Oura\u2019s unique selling point is still its comprehensive and effortless sleep tracking as the cornerstone of general health, but it has slowly added more and more features to track daytime health trends for a more holistic view.</p> <p>In addition to basic steps and calorie activity tracking, the rings can monitor cardiovascular health and automatically track 40 different workouts with heart rate zones. Oura\u2019s comprehensive women\u2019s health, fertility and pregnancy tracking has been expanded, and the ring can be used with the <a href=\"https://www.naturalcycles.com/oura\">Natural Cycles birth control service</a>.</p> <p>Its exercise tracking is still basic compared with a running or smart watch, but Oura can import workouts from third-party services such as Strava, which helps it to get a better picture of your overall health.</p> <h2>Better app now with an AI assistant</h2>    <p>Oura has overhauled its app to help manage the multiple metrics its rings now collect. The Today tab is dynamic and shows what is happening now, which is typically your activity, stress, heart rate and a timeline of the various events of your day such as when you woke up, when you ate, exercise and other things you can tag manually. A row of scores for readiness, sleep, activity, heart rate and stress provides one-tap access to them at the top of the page.</p> <p>The Vitals tab shows all the metrics the ring tracks, which are collected under overarching scores for readiness and sleep, your activity goal, daytime heart rate and stress. Many of the scores have baseline bars, so you can quickly see if things are currently within your normal range. Or you can expand each of them to see the various metrics that contribute to the score, including graphs and charts going back over the last days, weeks or months.</p> <p>The final tab is My Health, which is for long-term trends, such as your resilience to stress and illness, cardiovascular age and capacity, your sleep chronotype and various weekly and monthly reports.</p>    <p>The app also has a couple of AI features, including a meal logging system that recognises what you\u2019ve eaten using your phone\u2019s camera and puts it into your timeline. It works surprisingly well, even for random home-cooked meals, but is geared up for charting eating regularity rather than calorie counting.</p> <p>It also has a new \u201cOura Advisor\u201d AI chatbot, which looks at your health data and attempts to guide you towards a goal, providing a bit of mentoring or support. It can check in on you during the day via a notification on your phone to ask how you\u2019re feeling, and in my two weeks of testing it was smart enough to understand that the reason my daily activity had decreased was due to recovery from injury.</p> <p>Whether it proves useful over the longer term remains to be seen, but for those needing guidance on how to improve a particular aspect of their health it can at least offer tips and motivation.</p> <p>Overall the Oura app does a far better job of making its myriad metrics easy to interpret at both the macro and micro scale. It is also full of nice touches, such as changing the colour of the graph to correspond to the level of stress and providing haptic pulses on the phone in time to the recorded heart rate.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2>    <p>The Oura Ring 4 is not repairable and the battery is not replaceable. The company does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery, but it should maintain at least 80% of its original capacity after 500 full charge cycles. It does not include any recycled materials and Oura does not publish environmental impact reports or offer trade-in or recycling schemes.</p> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Oura Ring 4 starts at <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/product/rings/oura-ring-4/silver\">\u00a3349</a> (\u20ac399/$349/A$569) with a range of colours and finishes. The ring comes with one month free <a href=\"https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409086524819-Oura-Membership\">membership subscription</a>, which costs \u00a35.99 (\u20ac5.99/$5.99/A$9.99) a month or \u00a369.99/\u20ac69.99/$69.99/A$109.99 annually and is essential.</p> <p>For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Ring costs <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/rings/galaxy-ring/buy/\">\u00a3399</a>, the Ultrahuman Ring Air costs <a href=\"https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/buy/gb/\">\u00a3329</a> and an Apple Watch costs from <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-se\">\u00a3219</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Oura Ring 4 is a significant improvement in fit and comfort over predecessors, and doesn\u2019t remotely look like a piece of technology on your finger.</p> <p>Removing the sensor bumps on the inside of the ring has made it much easier to live with, particularly if you can wear a slightly smaller size, because it is still quite thick compared with a regular wedding band or similar.</p> <p>Its accuracy and battery life improvements are welcome. Oura\u2019s best-in-class sleep and general health tracking, as well as its good app and reliable syncing keep it ahead of increasingly fierce competition. If you want accurate health tracking without wearing technology on your wrist, the Oura is the answer.</p> <p>But the best smart ring on the market does not come cheap costing as much or more than a more capable smartwatch. And it requires a \u00a36-a-month subscription on top for anything other than basic data.</p> <p>Just like previous Ouras, the ring\u2019s biggest problem is that it cannot be repaired and the battery cannot be replaced, ultimately making it disposable and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/29/how-we-are-changing-the-way-we-rate-sustainability-of-consumer-electronics\">losing it a star</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> looks like jewellery not tech, comprehensive sleep and health tracking, great analysis of trends and helpful advice, easy to understand, six-day battery life, 100-metre water resistance, effective alternative for health to a smartwatch.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive, monthly subscription, thick for a ring, running and workout tracking is weak, doesn\u2019t do or track as much as a similarly priced smartwatch, cannot be repaired.</p> </blockquote>",

For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Ring costs \u00a3399, the Ultrahuman Ring Air costs \u00a3329 and an Apple Watch costs from \u00a3219. Verdict The Oura Ring 4 is a significant improvement in fit and comfort over predecessors, and doesn\u2019t remotely look like a piece of technology on your finger. Removing the sensor bumps on the inside of the ring has made it much easier to live with, particularly if you can wear a slightly smaller size, because it is still quite thick compared with a regular wedding band or similar. Its accuracy and battery life improvements are welcome. Oura\u2019s best-in-class sleep and general health tracking, as well as its good app and reliable syncing keep it ahead of increasingly fierce competition. If you want accurate health tracking without wearing technology on your wrist, the Oura is the answer. But the best smart ring on the market does not come cheap costing as much or more than a more capable smartwatch. And it requires a \u00a36-a-month subscription on top for anything other than basic data. Just like previous Ouras, the ring\u2019s biggest problem is that it cannot be repaired and the battery cannot be replaced, ultimately making it disposable and losing it a star. Pros: looks like jewellery not tech, comprehensive sleep and health tracking, great analysis of trends and helpful advice, easy to understand, six-day battery life, 100-metre water resistance, effective alternative for health to a smartwatch. Cons: expensive, monthly subscription, thick for a ring, running and workout tracking is weak, doesn\u2019t do or track as much as a similarly priced smartwatch, cannot be repaired.",

It came three years after Brownlee reached the top of Everest and resolved to climb all 14 of the world\u2019s highest peaks, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/adriana-brownlee-becomes-youngest-woman-to-conquer-the-14-peaks-t5kzjcdn5?t=1728977221495\">the Times reported</a>.</p> <p>As she neared the top of Shishapangma, she told the newspaper, \u201cI started to cry. I hadn\u2019t reached the summit yet, I couldn\u2019t even see it, but I knew it was going to happen. It took another hour before we reached the incredible summit.

Adriana Brownlee reached the 8,027-metre summit of Shishapangma in Tibet on 9 October, becoming the second British person to complete the gruelling feat. It came three years after Brownlee reached the top of Everest and resolved to climb all 14 of the world\u2019s highest peaks, the Times reported. As she neared the top of Shishapangma, she told the newspaper, \u201cI started to cry. I hadn\u2019t reached the summit yet, I couldn\u2019t even see it, but I knew it was going to happen.

      "body": "<p>During the second world war, British film was propaganda film. Cinema was the dominant popular medium, and the British state intervened in every part of the film industry.</p> <p>From Alexander Korda to Humphrey Jennings via Desert Victory, Mrs Miniver and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, the era routinely described as the \u201cgolden age\u201d of British cinema was also the period when British film was conspicuously shaped by the demands of wartime propagandists.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the second world war remains perhaps the dominant moral and cultural frame for understanding the contours of the contemporary world, this phenomenon has received surprisingly little consideration.</p> <p>Partly, this is because it\u2019s assumed (wrongly) that propaganda must be insincere, if not untrue; and partly it\u2019s because Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. If winning the war demanded that the audio-visual world had to be entirely reshaped, and with it the national imagination, so be it.</p> <p>But this is complacent and uncurious. Film came of age with the modern state. From the outset, the ability to blend fact, fantasy and fiction into novel and attention-grabbing forms made it the perfect medium for propaganda. It should be no surprise that the story of propaganda \u2013 like the story of the British state \u2013 has always been embedded in the history of British film.</p>    <p>If propaganda film was an activity that had been only reluctantly indulged, its history should have ended in 1945. Instead, in the decades after the Suez Crisis \u2013 and in response to decolonisation and the threats of the cold war \u2013 it was reconfigured.

      "bodyText": "During the second world war, British film was propaganda film. Cinema was the dominant popular medium, and the British state intervened in every part of the film industry. From Alexander Korda to Humphrey Jennings via Desert Victory, Mrs Miniver and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, the era routinely described as the \u201cgolden age\u201d of British cinema was also the period when British film was conspicuously shaped by the demands of wartime propagandists. Despite the fact that the second world war remains perhaps the dominant moral and cultural frame for understanding the contours of the contemporary world, this phenomenon has received surprisingly little consideration. Partly, this is because it\u2019s assumed (wrongly) that propaganda must be insincere, if not untrue; and partly it\u2019s because Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. If winning the war demanded that the audio-visual world had to be entirely reshaped, and with it the national imagination, so be it. But this is complacent and uncurious. Film came of age with the modern state. From the outset, the ability to blend fact, fantasy and fiction into novel and attention-grabbing forms made it the perfect medium for propaganda. It should be no surprise that the story of propaganda \u2013 like the story of the British state \u2013 has always been embedded in the history of British film. If propaganda film was an activity that had been only reluctantly indulged, its history should have ended in 1945. Instead, in the decades after the Suez Crisis \u2013 and in response to decolonisation and the threats of the cold war \u2013 it was reconfigured. The second world war wasn\u2019t an exception, it was the norm. In her seminal work Who Paid the Piper?, Frances Stonor Saunders detailed the CIA\u2019s programme of surreptitious Cold War cultural patronage. We can see something similar at work in the UK\u2019s information services. The British propaganda film operated across a broad cultural palette. In TV series like The Pacemakers, the Central Office of Information (COI) promoted a new generation of British professionals \u201cshaking up\u201d the cultural world. From the North Kensington Law Centre to Monty Python, via Erin Pizzey, Mary Quant and David Bowie, many of our celebrated icons of late 20th-century Britishness \u2013 a generation that have now passed from \u201ccounterculture\u201d to \u201csubject of an exhibition at the V&amp;A\u201d \u2013 were boosted in this way. Although never shown in Britain, for decades COI series like London Line, This Week in Britain, British Sporting Personalities, The Enthusiasts and The Pacemakers attracted overseas audiences in their millions. In addition to giving a platform to figures such as Lionel Ngakane, Jumoke Debayo and (now) Lord Boateng, the African version of London Line, for instance, sold British universities, medicines and expertise in prefabricated construction abroad. This pro-democracy propaganda self-consciously positioned itself against the norms established by interwar totalitarianism. But even at the time it generated ambivalent responses. One notable commentator was the French sociologist Jacques Ellul, who observed that the postwar period had seen propaganda orient away from managing mass politics and towards servicing the psychological anxieties of a growing middle class. If the propaganda film of the early 20th century had seen its ambitious political sweep replaced by a new postwar focus on buttressing individual identity, this was not because it had been politely defanged, but because its ideological appetites had expanded. Propaganda, feared Ellul, had become endemic: people demanded it, they required its reassurance, its templates, its models, to cope with the contradictions of the modern world. Ellul\u2019s thesis was not without its critics, but his prediction proved correct; even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the history of the propaganda film (again) did not come to an end. Initially, there was an observable shift from the state underwriting of culture as a good in itself towards a form of subsidy that saw film as an important way to package cultural heritage \u2013 from Derek Jarman to Paddington \u2013 into a form that encouraged inward investment; or more realistically, sold holidays to foreign visitors. But since 7/7, new institutional sponsors such as the Research, Information and Communications Unit (Ricu) have been flooding the digital space with audio-visual propaganda. In terms of volume of content, we are living through the heyday of the propaganda film. On an individual basis the short films may not be that interesting; instead the effort is to shape a culture. In the contemporary world the propaganda film has become ubiquitous. From the Counter-Disinformation Unit to the Army\u2019s 77th Brigade the work of these new agencies is always justified as a response to threats against national security. No doubt it is. In his essay Bullshit Jobs, David Graeber argued that the post-industrial economy generates many white-collar jobs that \u2013 functionally speaking \u2013 do not need to exist, but which instead encourage a whole swathe of society to identify with the perspectives of big finance. With some risk of overstatement, we can see something analogous in the propaganda film. We live in a world where the British state has become the nation\u2019s largest advertiser, while the media industry sucks up enormous numbers of graduates. Ricu has apparently sold its expertise to governments throughout Asia, Africa and Europe as well as to the EU through an international offshoot. The propaganda film has become a service that can be exported. Numerous intellectuals, writers and film-makers are actively employed in the psychological, technological and sociological reshaping of the world, a scenario which perhaps also makes them the ones most exposed to \u2013 and susceptible to \u2013 the claims of the propaganda film. Our image of propaganda is stuck in the 1930s, with the visionary, transformative films of Leni Riefenstahl and Sergei Eisenstein. But today the propaganda film is less about individual objects than about shaping an audio-visual environment. It has become extremely difficult to sustain the idea that the propaganda film is something that only other people \u2013 mainly bad people \u2013 do to us. Or even that there is something particularly unBritish about it. \u2022 Scott Anthony is the author of the novel Changi. His book The Story of British Propaganda Film is published on 3 October.

      "bodyText": "A Chinese propaganda image dispersed during Monday\u2019s military drills around Taiwan was supposed to send a positive message to the island\u2019s people, but instead has been decried as weird, creepy, and akin to \u201csexual harassment\u201d. On Monday China targeted Taiwan with major military exercises, surrounding its main island and outer territories with planes and ships to practise a blockade and attack. Alongside a record number of warplanes, dozens of navy and coastguard vessels, and cyber-attacks, China also launched a torrent of propaganda. Among video montages of soldiers rushing towards troop carriers, photos of captains staring through binoculars from the deck of a warship, and breathless editorials about \u201cinevitable reunification\u201d, one piece of media stood out: a love heart. The illustration, widely shared online, depicted a satellite image of Taiwan\u2019s main island, and a line of arrows tracking around it in the shape of a heart. Accompanying script \u2013 in the traditional Chinese characters used by Taiwan \u2013 read: \u201cHi my sweetheart\u201d and \u201cThe patrol is in the shape of loving you.\u201d The image came from China\u2019s coastguard, which ran what it called \u201claw enforcement patrols\u201d around Taiwan during Monday\u2019s drills. Taiwan\u2019s coastguard officials decried the image as Chinese cognitive warfare and harassment. But it didn\u2019t appear to have the desired impact on the Taiwanese population. In local news the image prompted headlines. On social media it drew mostly ridicule and anger. People found the image \u201ccreepy\u201d, and comment sections filled with vomit-emojis. Some likened the sentiment expressed to an abusive partner, while one newspaper called it \u201csexual harassment\u201d. Many were also perplexed by what appeared to be a reference to a 15-year-old Taiwanese TV drama, Hi My Sweetheart, long off the air. Some people surmised the reference was supposed to remind people of the show\u2019s star, the local actor Rainie Yang, who has faced criticism in Taiwan for saying she is Chinese and for posting pro-China content online. Past propaganda efforts have included crude animations of missiles striking major cities in Taiwan. In August 2022, during drills launched in retaliation for a visit by the US speaker, Nancy Pelosi, China was accused of hacking into monitors at Taiwanese train stations and convenience stores to display messages disparaging her.",

Since then, it\u2019s been a history of near-misses, might-have-beens, and massive whiffs at the most important position in football \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/tom-brady-tampa-bay-buccaneers-playbooks-nfl-quarterback\">perhaps the most consequential position</a> in any sport.</p> <p>This is the franchise that lost a coin flip for the fourth overall pick in the 1944 draft with the Detroit Lions, who used that pick on Otto Graham, who never played for the Lions, but succeeded at a Hall of Fame level with the Cleveland Browns. There was more: the third overall pick in the 1948 draft, Bobby Layne, was quickly traded to the Bears. But Layne refused to return to the team after a year playing behind Luckman and Johnny Lujack. Layne later became a Hall of Fame quarterback with the Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers. The Bears also selected George Blanda in the 12th round of the 1949 draft, but owner and head coach George Halas insisted that Blanda was more of a kicker than a quarterback. Blanda responded by defecting to the American Football League in 1960 after a one-year retirement, and, yes, put together his own Hall of Fame career together there.</p> <p>And in 1979, Bears scout Bill Tobin had a first-round grade on a certain Notre Dame star, but general manager Jim Finks was happy with mediocre quarterback Bob Avellini. The Notre Dame quarterback? Joe Montana.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the AFL-NFL common draft in 1967, the Bears have spent first-round picks on seven quarterbacks \u2013 Jim McMahon in 1982, Jim Harbaugh in 1987, Cade McNown in 1999, Rex Grossman in 2003, Mitch Trubisky in 2017, Justin Fields in 2021 and Williams in 2024.</p> <p>None of those first six picks really panned out besides McMahon, who was more of a punky accessory to the Chicago teams of the mid-1980s that sported some of the best defenses pro football has ever seen.</p> <p>This is how you travel time since your inception as one of the NFL\u2019s original teams in 1920 without a quarterback throwing for 4,000 yards or 30 touchdowns in a single season. Given the advancements made to the passing game, that\u2019s an astonishing drought. And a curse of the franchise\u2019s own making.</p> <p>Through the first four weeks of Williams\u2019 NFL career, it appeared that the curse might actually be a thing. Williams completed just 87 of 141 passes (61.7%) for 786 yards (5.6 yards per attempt), three touchdowns, four interceptions, a passer rating of 72.0 (second-worst in the league among qualifying quarterbacks), and 16 sacks behind a leaky offensive line.</p> <p>But over the last two games, against the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars (admittedly, two bad defenses), the light has switched on. Over those games, Williams completed 43 of 58 passes (74.1%) for 530 yards (9.1 yards per attempt), six touchdowns, one interception, and a league-best passer rating of 129.2.</p> <p>When grading a quarterback\u2019s progress, whether it comes against great defenses or not, you\u2019re looking for the universal qualities that comprise great play at the position. And especially against the Jaguars in London, Williams proved to have those universal qualities in an intercontinental sense.</p> <p>Two of Williams\u2019s four touchdown passes against the Jaguars went to veteran receiver Keenan Allen, and the others went to tight end Cole Kmet, who also served as Chicago\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/cole-kmet-on-stepping-in-as-long-snapper-biggest-nightmare-came-true\">emergency long-snapper in the game</a>. The first TD pass to Kmet came out of a nifty design. Allen went in orbit motion, and Williams\u2019 double-fake flat route passes set Jacksonville\u2019s defense on edge enough for Kmet to be wide open down the middle of the field.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL_DougFarrar/status/1845818727578963997\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Orbit motion, double fake flat routes, and hit a wide-open Cole Kmet upfield because Jaguars linebacker Devin Lloyd has become your huckleberry. <a href=\"https://t.co/FoEq9WXd3B\">pic.twitter.com/FoEq9WXd3B</a></p>&mdash; Doug Farrar \u270d (@NFL_DougFarrar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL_DougFarrar/status/1845818727578963997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Kmet\u2019s second touchdown was facilitated by Williams looking the safety off at the back of the end zone to an area the quarterback wanted the safety to go.

At first his wife, Alissa, struggled to get pregnant and required fertility treatment. Then came Emilie, born on 12 May 2006 \u2013 the first of three daughters.</p> <p>Parker remembers her as an extrovert who was speaking before she grew teeth. She was an avid reader and loved the film Puss in Boots: later he would find a notebook in which she redrew the character over 100 pages until she felt she got it right. \u201cSeeing that determination in her \u2026 she never turned that off.</p>    <p>\u201cWe\u2019d put her to bed, I\u2019d see her light on and be like, hey, what are you doing, you need to go to bed. She\u2019s like, I have so many ideas in my head and I can\u2019t fall asleep until I get them out. She would be up late and then she\u2019d be up early working on something, getting everything that was in her head out of there.<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>The family moved from New Mexico to Newtown in January 2012 for Parker\u2019s job as a physician assistant in the neonatal intensive care unit at Danbury hospital. Emilie finished kindergarten at Sandy Hook then started first grade, though that was disrupted by the death of her grandfather; she missed her class photo but loved it all the same.</p> <p>The community was preparing for Christmas on 14 December. Emilie had found what she called \u201cthe perfect box\u201d to collect toys to donate to other kids. Parker woke early and saw that Emilie was already up; she greeted him in Portuguese, which she had been learning from him (he had lived in Brazil for two years after high school).</p> <p>\u201cWe were able to have our last conversation \u2013 obviously I didn\u2019t realise that\u2019s what it was. But it was cute opening the door and seeing her sitting on her bed. I don\u2019t know what she was thinking about but she saw me and lit up and went: \u2018<em>Bom dia!</em>\u2019 [good morning] and she smiled.\u201d</p> <p>Parker was at work when he got a disturbing voicemail from a city official saying that all Newtown public schools had been locked down due to a reported shooting. Then Alissa called, full of fear. At first Parker was told to remain at the hospital, where he might be needed, but he headed towards the school.</p> <p>He parked behind a shop and sprinted half a mile, past satellite news vans and cameras, towards a small fire station. Alissa and other parents had gathered there, putting their name and their child\u2019s name on a list, then waiting anxiously in a conference room.</p> <p>Alissa told Parker it was confirmed that 20 children had been killed. A police officer had said no details or names would be shared until everyone was accounted for. She whispered quietly, so no one else could hear: \u201cRobbie, is she dead?\u201d He replied: \u201cOf course not,\u201d and held his wife tight.</p> <p>He recalls: \u201cI was in denial. I was scared too, and I couldn\u2019t face it.</p> <p>\u201cThe hours spent at the firehouse were hard because the tension was building with every passing minute. Every hour they would come in to give us an update, but they never updated us on anything. The police officer that was in charge would come and leave. You could feel the tension building in the room<em> </em>but everybody had this sense of hope<em>.</em>\u201d</p> <p>As Parker recalls, the conference room was full of plastic chairs with tables pushed off to the side. Alissa suffered a panic attack and a paramedic gave her an oxygen mask until she recovered. An officer approached the couple asking for a description of their daughter and wrote down details of Emilie\u2019s blond hair, blue eyes and white-and-pink ruffled skirt. Family and friends around the country saw the news on TV and began calling. Still there was no definitive information.</p>    <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://portal.ct.gov/malloy-archive/about-the-governor/governor-malloy-biography\">Dannel Malloy</a>, the governor of Connecticut, and his entourage entered the conference room. He began speaking in a manner that suggested none of the children of those present had survived. A mother interrupted him to demand: \u201cSo are you trying to tell us that all of our kids are dead?\u201d The governor looked stunned and could only reply: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Then Alissa asked: \u201cWhat about the children that went to the hospital? What is their status?\u201d Parker recalls that the governor was like a deer in the headlights as he answered: \u201cThey have expired.\u201d</p> <p>Parker says: \u201cIt was as if he hadn\u2019t been briefed that we hadn\u2019t been briefed. I get the sense that he felt like he was coming in to talk to us as if we already knew and we didn\u2019t know and I don\u2019t think he was prepared to be the person that broke it. A lot of parents, when we talk, have issues with the way that the news is broken because that\u2019s how it was.\u201d</p> <p>That was the moment when hope was extinguished. \u201cIt\u2019s like a scene in a movie where you have the character that\u2019s walking through like all the stuff around them but it\u2019s in silence. That\u2019s what my memory is. Alissa and I looked at each other, we looked at our neighbour and we said, thanks for being here.\u201d</p> <p>Parker and Alissa bolted through a back door in the conference room, breathed in the fresh air and tried to gather their wits. They walked around the corner of the fire station and were confronted by a wall of clicking cameras with no way through. A kind firefighter cleared a path for them to reach their vehicle.</p> <p>Parker\u2019s voice wobbles as he continues: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe what it was like getting home and walking into the house. My brother came out when he saw the car pull up and, just [the] look on my face, he knew \u2013 we hadn\u2019t said anything and so he came up and gave us a hug. Then you walked in this house that just that morning had so much excitement and love and warmth and it felt as cold and dark as a cave.\u201d</p> <p>Then they had to tell their younger daughters Madeline, who was four, and three-year-old Samantha, that their sister would not be coming home. Again, despite his medical training, Parker felt inadequate.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve broken the news to parents that their child had died but I\u2019ve never broken news to a sibling that their sibling had died. I didn\u2019t know how to do that and that bothered me because, again, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s supposed to know how to behave in these situations \u2026 So we did the best that we could.\u201d</p>    <p>The media pressure kept building. The Parkers\u2019 phone was ringing relentlessly and there were constant knocks on the door. Other family members were also under siege. Worried that someone might say something erroneous or taken out of context, Parker came up with the idea of making a statement to the media. Alissa backed the idea but did not want to take part.</p> <p>\u201cThe hope was, I\u2019m going to give the media a bone to chew on so that they\u2019ll leave us alone and we can focus on what we need to focus on. That was the intent and there\u2019s all my reasons for feeling like that was the thing to do. I had no clue that was the worst thing I could have done.\u201d</p> <p>Parker planned to meet one reporter at the church. But when he arrived, there were dozens of cameras, reporters and news crews. Suddenly, less than 24 hours after his daughter\u2019s death, he found himself giving a press conference on live television. Trying to calm himself, he recalls, he let out a weird half-laugh and smile towards some family members supporting him.</p> <p>He proceeded to deliver a beautiful tribute to Emilie. \u201cI felt like it was a chance to let the world know who Emilie was and what we were missing and what she meant to all of us. I felt like it embodied who Emilie was and is for us and I was able to give it and I got through it and was done. It was one of the few times in my life where I was actually proud of myself in the moment for what had happened.\u201d</p> <p>But that momentary chuckle and smile before he spoke would haunt Parker for the next decade. It was seized upon by the rightwing conspiracy theorist Jones, who did mocking impressions of Parker, switching from laughing to crying in an instant. He repeatedly used the clip on his Infowars show to spread the pernicious falsehood that Parker and others were \u201ccrisis actors\u201d and that the shooting never happened.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I was still sitting in the firehouse, he was already on his show telling people to question the shooting and claiming that it was fake and that this was the government and Obama, they\u2019ve been planning this thing and they\u2019re trying to come for your guns. He already had this narrative ready to go.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you juxtapose that, you have parents who aren\u2019t even sure if they\u2019re grieving yet \u2013 they\u2019re not even aware if their kid\u2019s dead \u2013 and you have somebody already spouting off to millions of people that it\u2019s not real and it\u2019s not happening. It\u2019s hard to get anybody, including myself, to wrap your mind around just how awful and evil that is.\u201d</p> <p>Parker came to blame himself and feel guilt and shame for, in his mind, having started it all. \u201cThat quickly became the narrative because I was the first person who spoke out so all that attention could focus on me. I gave them some fodder that they could use because I was smiling and laughing and then I got into \u2018character\u2019.</p>    <p>\u201cWhen they call it \u2018a crisis actor\u2019 that sounds benign but to people that imbibe that kind of material and assimilate that worldview, being a crisis actor means that you\u2019re in cahoots and that you are essentially a target. Like, I\u2019m in cahoots with Obama and the Democrats and liberals and I\u2019m part of the problem that\u2019s trying to take away your guns. Now you have my name and my face and you know who to go after.\u201d</p> <p>Victims\u2019 families were subjected to years of torment, threats and abuse by people who believed the lies told on Jones\u2019s show. One father said conspiracy theorists urinated on his seven-year-old son\u2019s grave and threatened to dig up the coffin. A Facebook page honouring Emilie was inundated with hate.</p> <p>Parker says: \u201cYou\u2019re already overwhelmed emotionally from grief but it felt like the second wave of a tsunami coming and hitting us \u2026 Then you have people saying you\u2019re a liar. They\u2019re bashing Emilie\u2019s name. They\u2019re calling her horrible things. They\u2019re saying a bunch of horrible things about me and then there are threats. In the weeks afterwards, they called my work, they emailed me, they wrote letters to my home. It\u2019s all very encompassing and overwhelming. The biggest impact is that it robs your ability to grieve.</p> <p>\u201cYou should have those moments right after your loved one dies to remember and cherish them because that\u2019s as close as you\u2019re going to be to them for ever. It\u2019s a very sacred time and that got stolen from us.\u201d</p> <p>The pressure made Parker turn inward, away from his family and into isolation. A year after the shooting, he quit his job and they moved across the country in search of a fresh start. But even 3,000 miles from Newtown, an Infowars listener accosted him and accused him of being a liar.</p> <p>In 2018, 17 students were killed in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida. Parker knew one of the parents who lost a child and learned that they too were receiving abusive messages and having their grief stolen. In a separate incident, his daughter Madeline saw an Infowars bumper sticker on a vehicle and expressed fear that her father would be bullied by the driver.</p> <p>These events spurred Parker to join a lawsuit that would hold Jones to account. In 2022 Jones lost a series of defamation cases in Connecticut and Texas and was ordered to pay <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/us/politics/alex-jones-finances.html\" title=\"\">nearly $1.5bn in damages</a> to the families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims. Later that year he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/us/politics/alex-jones-bankruptcy.html\">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p> <p>Parker watched with grim satisfaction as lawyer Chris Mattei tore Jones apart in Connecticut. Then, to his surprise, Mattei forced Jones to watch the whole of Parker\u2019s press conference. Sitting on the front row of the hushed courtroom, Parker watched Jones\u2019s reaction intently.</p>    <p>\u201cAt first he has a monitor in front of him and he\u2019s watching it and he sees me laugh and he laughs and then, as it goes on, he averts his gaze. There are monitors all over the courtroom so I\u2019m watching him try to avoid me everywhere he looks and he couldn\u2019t avoid any of it. He looks so small and uncomfortable with nowhere to go with the truth surrounding him.</p> <p>\u201cOne saying that I\u2019ve appreciated to incorporate in my home life is: every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth and eventually that debt gets paid.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, in that moment, the lies that he had told about me and about that press conference and about Emilie, that debt was starting to not be repaid but it was coming to collect and he couldn\u2019t get away from it. I\u2019m so glad that Chris did that because, seeing his reaction and me watching it again with a new light, I felt proud again.\u201d</p> <p>After all the years of hate, Parker had made peace with the press conference. \u201cI had despised giving it because of what it did to me and my family and I hated the idea that I did it and I cursed myself for doing it. Then in that moment I could feel happy again that I had done it and I am glad that I did it. I was right there willing and ready to take it back from Alex Jones because it was never his.<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>Parker now works in the neonatal intensive care unit at Oregon Health Science University. His wife and daughters \u2013 Madeline is now 16, Samantha, 15 \u2013 were motivating factors to keep him moving forward through the darkest times. He also had something to fight for: Emilie\u2019s name.</p> <p>\u201cGrief teaches you so much more than dealing with the loss of your loved one,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIt opens you up to who you are as a person. Don\u2019t be scared of opening yourself up to learn more about you and what grief has to offer you. Grief is like a mentor; at first a lot of people hate it and they don\u2019t want to acknowledge this new character, this new essence and power in their life.</p> <p>\u201cBut it has so much to teach you, and my relationship with grief is so much more loving. There\u2019s this mutual level of respect between what it\u2019s offered me and what I\u2019ve learned from it. Opening yourself up to the entire process of grieving would be advice I wish I would have known.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 A Father\u2019s Fight by Robbie Parker will be published by Diversion on 5 December</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the blow came, it was absurd in its clumsiness. If you are in this room, the state governor acknowledged, it means that your child is dead. The parents of Sandy Hook elementary school pupils, who had been waiting hours for news, knew they would walk out of that room as different people. \u201cI could feel the tension holding on to that hope, just like you\u2019re holding this little flame, this flicker of hope,\u201d recalls Robbie Parker, whose six-year-old daughter Emilie was among the dead. \u201cAnd then with his words, that being snuffed out. It was like a big eruption of emotion and then like a vacuum because none of us had any hope any more. I have a really weird relationship with hope now.\u201d On 14 December 2012, Adam Lanza, 20, shot and killed his mother at home then entered Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Armed with a semiautomatic rifle, two semiautomatic pistols and multiple rounds of ammunition, he killed 20 children aged six and seven, and six adults. When Lanza heard the police closing in, he took his own life in a classroom. Barack Obama was moved to tears by the tragedy and later described it as \u201cthe single darkest day of my presidency\u201d. Parker was the first parent to voice his grief in public after the massacre \u2013 a decision that led to a decade-long struggle against the rightwing provocateur Alex Jones, who propagated the lie that he was a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d and the entire shooting was a hoax to justify gun restrictions. In that sense, Parker is a double survivor. Sitting at home in his kitchen in Washington state, Parker speaks via Zoom for more than two hours, holding his composure even when his eyes glisten and his voice cracks. The 42-year-old has written a book, A Father\u2019s Fight, in an effort to \u201cexpress what I see as a void in the world because she\u2019s not there any more\u201d. Parker grew up in Texas and Utah, started a medical career focused on child health and safety, and married in 2003. At first his wife, Alissa, struggled to get pregnant and required fertility treatment. Then came Emilie, born on 12 May 2006 \u2013 the first of three daughters.

One father said conspiracy theorists urinated on his seven-year-old son\u2019s grave and threatened to dig up the coffin. A Facebook page honouring Emilie was inundated with hate. Parker says: \u201cYou\u2019re already overwhelmed emotionally from grief but it felt like the second wave of a tsunami coming and hitting us \u2026 Then you have people saying you\u2019re a liar. They\u2019re bashing Emilie\u2019s name. They\u2019re calling her horrible things. They\u2019re saying a bunch of horrible things about me and then there are threats. In the weeks afterwards, they called my work, they emailed me, they wrote letters to my home. It\u2019s all very encompassing and overwhelming. The biggest impact is that it robs your ability to grieve. \u201cYou should have those moments right after your loved one dies to remember and cherish them because that\u2019s as close as you\u2019re going to be to them for ever. It\u2019s a very sacred time and that got stolen from us.\u201d The pressure made Parker turn inward, away from his family and into isolation. A year after the shooting, he quit his job and they moved across the country in search of a fresh start. But even 3,000 miles from Newtown, an Infowars listener accosted him and accused him of being a liar. In 2018, 17 students were killed in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida. Parker knew one of the parents who lost a child and learned that they too were receiving abusive messages and having their grief stolen. In a separate incident, his daughter Madeline saw an Infowars bumper sticker on a vehicle and expressed fear that her father would be bullied by the driver. These events spurred Parker to join a lawsuit that would hold Jones to account. In 2022 Jones lost a series of defamation cases in Connecticut and Texas and was ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn in damages to the families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims. Later that year he filed for bankruptcy. Parker watched with grim satisfaction as lawyer Chris Mattei tore Jones apart in Connecticut. Then, to his surprise, Mattei forced Jones to watch the whole of Parker\u2019s press conference. Sitting on the front row of the hushed courtroom, Parker watched Jones\u2019s reaction intently. \u201cAt first he has a monitor in front of him and he\u2019s watching it and he sees me laugh and he laughs and then, as it goes on, he averts his gaze. There are monitors all over the courtroom so I\u2019m watching him try to avoid me everywhere he looks and he couldn\u2019t avoid any of it. He looks so small and uncomfortable with nowhere to go with the truth surrounding him. \u201cOne saying that I\u2019ve appreciated to incorporate in my home life is: every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth and eventually that debt gets paid. \u201cFor me, in that moment, the lies that he had told about me and about that press conference and about Emilie, that debt was starting to not be repaid but it was coming to collect and he couldn\u2019t get away from it. I\u2019m so glad that Chris did that because, seeing his reaction and me watching it again with a new light, I felt proud again.\u201d After all the years of hate, Parker had made peace with the press conference. \u201cI had despised giving it because of what it did to me and my family and I hated the idea that I did it and I cursed myself for doing it. Then in that moment I could feel happy again that I had done it and I am glad that I did it. I was right there willing and ready to take it back from Alex Jones because it was never his.\u201d Parker now works in the neonatal intensive care unit at Oregon Health Science University. His wife and daughters \u2013 Madeline is now 16, Samantha, 15 \u2013 were motivating factors to keep him moving forward through the darkest times. He also had something to fight for: Emilie\u2019s name. \u201cGrief teaches you so much more than dealing with the loss of your loved one,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIt opens you up to who you are as a person. Don\u2019t be scared of opening yourself up to learn more about you and what grief has to offer you. Grief is like a mentor; at first a lot of people hate it and they don\u2019t want to acknowledge this new character, this new essence and power in their life. \u201cBut it has so much to teach you, and my relationship with grief is so much more loving. There\u2019s this mutual level of respect between what it\u2019s offered me and what I\u2019ve learned from it. Opening yourself up to the entire process of grieving would be advice I wish I would have known.\u201d \u2022 A Father\u2019s Fight by Robbie Parker will be published by Diversion on 5 December",

      "body": "<p>Rugby union has bid adieu to two significant figures in recent days. Today\u2019s players may not be overly familiar with Kevin Bowring, the first professional head coach of Wales between 1995-98, or Ronnie Dawson, who led the British &amp; Irish Lions to a famous win against the All Blacks in 1959 and later became Ireland\u2019s first national coach, but both helped to change their sport for the better.</p> <p>Dawson, among myriad other roles, was a member of the committee that organised the transformative first Rugby World Cup while Bowring was a brilliant mentor to many of modern rugby\u2019s most thoughtful coaches and educators from Stuart Lancaster and Shaun Edwards to Ben Ryan and Toby Booth. Lancaster reckoned Bowring, the Neath\u2011born son of a carpenter, had few peers \u2013 \u201cI really think the world has lost one of the great coaching minds\u201d \u2013 and Ryan felt likewise: \u201c[He] pushed my thinking upstream, when as a young coach I only ever swam downstream.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/14/rugby-union-richard-wigglesworth-promoted-steve-borthwick-autumn-internationals\">Wigglesworth promoted to Borthwick\u2019s second-in-command for England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another of his grateful proteges, Russell Earnshaw, put it even more lyrically. \u201cIf coaching is about your coaching tree, Kevin planted forests. If it\u2019s about the ripples you create he threw boulders in the lake. If it\u2019s about the footprint you leave he took a million steps.\u201d As the warmth of the tributes imply, Bowring\u2019s great gift was to open minds to previously unimagined possibilities and lift young coaches\u2019 eyes up to the hills.</p> <p>Which is perhaps even more important in the professional era. The pressure for results can be all-consuming and not everything can be easily micromanaged. As the England men\u2019s head coach, Steve Borthwick, has been finding. He must have flown home from New Zealand in July thinking he had weathered the worst of a turbulent year. Within weeks he had parted company with two key lieutenants, Aled Walters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/24/felix-jones-resigns-as-england-defence-coach-rugby-union-borthwick\">and Felix Jones</a>, who had done more than most to establish an upbeat mood within the camp.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/14/rugby-union-richard-wigglesworth-promoted-steve-borthwick-autumn-internationals\">newly confirmed promotion of Richard Wigglesworth</a> to an expanded assistant\u2019s role is the latest twist to the tale, lending further intrigue to England\u2019s autumn squad announcement on Wednesday. Because Borthwick is approaching a keynote phase of his stewardship. His side needs some fresh momentum having lost four of their past six Tests, albeit narrowly, and will be eyeing at least three victories from their four home November internationals.

Simply going with the orthodox flow is not enough. It has to do with balance, gut feel and clarity of vision, particularly at a time when England are spoilt for choice in some positions. Borthwick has been very clear that consistency of selection is pivotal to his thinking. Fair enough but so should be retaining an open mind and keeping one eye on the future.</p> <p>Take his many options on the wings. Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and Tommy Freeman are the men in possession and will almost certainly be retained for the visit of New Zealand on 2 November, with Ollie Sleightholme hard on their heels. But anyone who has watched the early rounds of the Gallagher Premiership will also have been impressed by Sale\u2019s Tom Roebuck, Saracens\u2019 Tobias Elliott, Gloucester\u2019s Christian Wade and Ollie Thorley and Bristol\u2019s Gabriel Ibitoye. Bath\u2019s Joe Cokanasiga and Will Muir missed the national camp last week through injury and we have not yet mentioned Anthony Watson, Ollie Hassell-Collins or Adam Radwan, let alone the versatile Elliot Daly and Max Malins. The list goes on and on.</p>    <p>It is similarly crowded in the back row. If you saw Ted Hill, Jack Clement and Jack Kenningham playing at the weekend you would have assumed they must be near certainties for Borthwick\u2019s squad. Maybe all of them will feature for England A against Australia A next month but there are at least 10 back-rowers above them in the pecking order in Ben Earl, Tom and Ben Curry, Ollie Chessum, Sam Underhill, Chandler Cunningham\u2011South, Ethan Roots, Tom Pearson, Tom Willis and Greg Fisilau. Add Bath\u2019s up\u2011and\u2011coming Guy Pepper, the bullocking Alfie Barbeary, Harlequins\u2019 turnover king Will Evans and Northampton\u2019s U20 World Cup winner Henry Pollock and competition could hardly be fiercer even without the French-based Jack Willis, Sam Simmonds, Lewis Ludlam and Billy Vunipola.</p> <p>So what to do? England first need to review the gameplan and combinations that offer the best chance of winning the next World Cup. Out wide, in addition to Feyi\u2011Waboso and Freeman on the wings, they probably need another footballer and a marksman.

      "bodyText": "Rugby union has bid adieu to two significant figures in recent days. Today\u2019s players may not be overly familiar with Kevin Bowring, the first professional head coach of Wales between 1995-98, or Ronnie Dawson, who led the British &amp; Irish Lions to a famous win against the All Blacks in 1959 and later became Ireland\u2019s first national coach, but both helped to change their sport for the better. Dawson, among myriad other roles, was a member of the committee that organised the transformative first Rugby World Cup while Bowring was a brilliant mentor to many of modern rugby\u2019s most thoughtful coaches and educators from Stuart Lancaster and Shaun Edwards to Ben Ryan and Toby Booth. Lancaster reckoned Bowring, the Neath\u2011born son of a carpenter, had few peers \u2013 \u201cI really think the world has lost one of the great coaching minds\u201d \u2013 and Ryan felt likewise: \u201c[He] pushed my thinking upstream, when as a young coach I only ever swam downstream.\u201d Another of his grateful proteges, Russell Earnshaw, put it even more lyrically. \u201cIf coaching is about your coaching tree, Kevin planted forests. If it\u2019s about the ripples you create he threw boulders in the lake. If it\u2019s about the footprint you leave he took a million steps.\u201d As the warmth of the tributes imply, Bowring\u2019s great gift was to open minds to previously unimagined possibilities and lift young coaches\u2019 eyes up to the hills. Which is perhaps even more important in the professional era. The pressure for results can be all-consuming and not everything can be easily micromanaged. As the England men\u2019s head coach, Steve Borthwick, has been finding. He must have flown home from New Zealand in July thinking he had weathered the worst of a turbulent year. Within weeks he had parted company with two key lieutenants, Aled Walters and Felix Jones, who had done more than most to establish an upbeat mood within the camp. The newly confirmed promotion of Richard Wigglesworth to an expanded assistant\u2019s role is the latest twist to the tale, lending further intrigue to England\u2019s autumn squad announcement on Wednesday. Because Borthwick is approaching a keynote phase of his stewardship. His side needs some fresh momentum having lost four of their past six Tests, albeit narrowly, and will be eyeing at least three victories from their four home November internationals. Which is about to intensify the focus on one of coaching\u2019s trickiest skills: the art of selection. Because even the smartest and most enlightened of coaches must first ensure the right people are in the room. Simply going with the orthodox flow is not enough. It has to do with balance, gut feel and clarity of vision, particularly at a time when England are spoilt for choice in some positions. Borthwick has been very clear that consistency of selection is pivotal to his thinking. Fair enough but so should be retaining an open mind and keeping one eye on the future. Take his many options on the wings. Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and Tommy Freeman are the men in possession and will almost certainly be retained for the visit of New Zealand on 2 November, with Ollie Sleightholme hard on their heels. But anyone who has watched the early rounds of the Gallagher Premiership will also have been impressed by Sale\u2019s Tom Roebuck, Saracens\u2019 Tobias Elliott, Gloucester\u2019s Christian Wade and Ollie Thorley and Bristol\u2019s Gabriel Ibitoye. Bath\u2019s Joe Cokanasiga and Will Muir missed the national camp last week through injury and we have not yet mentioned Anthony Watson, Ollie Hassell-Collins or Adam Radwan, let alone the versatile Elliot Daly and Max Malins. The list goes on and on. It is similarly crowded in the back row. If you saw Ted Hill, Jack Clement and Jack Kenningham playing at the weekend you would have assumed they must be near certainties for Borthwick\u2019s squad. Maybe all of them will feature for England A against Australia A next month but there are at least 10 back-rowers above them in the pecking order in Ben Earl, Tom and Ben Curry, Ollie Chessum, Sam Underhill, Chandler Cunningham\u2011South, Ethan Roots, Tom Pearson, Tom Willis and Greg Fisilau.

      "bodyText": "A One Nation candidate running in the Queensland election has likened Covid-19 vaccination to the Holocaust in comments condemned by medical experts and a Jewish community leader. Gary Williamson, a bricklayer who is running for the seat of Redlands, also told Guardian Australia he \u201cjust might\u201d build a bridge from the state\u2019s mainland to an island on which he is building what he calls \u201cFalcon Castle\u201d. He claimed to have evidence of a paedophile ring operating on that island. Williamson made the comparison between Covid and the Holocaust on social media before becoming a candidate \u2013 but doubled down on this position on Tuesday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cHitler, forced people into gas chambers. Covid-19, had people lining up, which is worse..!?!\u201d Williamson wrote on Facebook on 6 June, along with a computer generated image of a man shooting a basketball into a hoop. One Nation would not comment on the posts when contacted on Tuesday. Williamson later deleted the images, but confirmed he made the posts to Guardian Australia. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a politician back then, I was a concerned Australian,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] actually, if you want a comment, I believe 98% of Australia has got my back on this.\u201d Williamson was then asked if he stood by those comments. \u201cWell, I support One Nation\u2019s look into the royal commission investigating the misleading information that was forwarded by the government,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely\u201d. Health experts and a Jewish community leader condemned the One Nation candidate\u2019s comments as \u201csupremely ignorant\u201d, \u201cappalling\u201d and dangerous. Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said such a comparison to the Holocaust might come across as \u201cidle hyperbole\u201d, but that it \u201cdilutes the gravity of historical events and portrays ordinary Australians, including medical professionals, as mass killers\u201d. \u201cPeople can express their views about the appropriateness of government measures during the pandemic but equating vaccines intended to save life with gas chambers in which millions were murdered with the cruelest and most barbaric intent is supremely ignorant,\u201d he said. Deakin epidemiology chair and distinguished professor, Catherine Bennett, said vaccine conspiracy theories cost lives and labelled Williamson\u2019s post \u201cappalling\u201d. Prof Bennett said misrepresentation of information and people \u201cflagrantly making up these really inflammatory statements\u201d had caused public confusion and contributed to a drop off in vaccination, especially among the young. \u201cA young life damaged or lost from a vaccine preventable disease is the consequence of this kind of activity,\u201d she said. Australian National University infectious diseases specialist, associate prof Sanjaya Senanayake, said comments like Williamson\u2019s were \u201cdisappointing\u201d but not surprising. He said medical misinformation and disinformation was rife and being spread on social media \u2013 but that Covid vaccines \u201cmade the biggest difference\u201d in the world being able to navigate its way through the pandemic. \u201cIf it was 2024 and we didn\u2019t have a Covid vaccine, at this point we would be looking at a completely different story.\u201d Conservative estimates made in a study by RMIT and Monash University found that in New South Wales alone, Covid-19 vaccines saved at least 17,760 lives over a two-year period during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks. As of Tuesday morning, a series of anti-vaccination posts remained on Williamson\u2019s Instagram \u2013 whose profile image carries the One Nation banner and bio includes a link to his bricklaying company. One video, posted on 25 April 2022, shows a bong with a cone packed with a green substance, a heat gun, a packet of cigarettes, coffee grinder, can of coke and a coffee mug carrying his business logo. \u201cIve just killed covid in less than 24 hours using a simple heat treatment,\u201d it is captioned. \u201cOk I\u2019ve made the bong and I\u2019ve set up me heat gun at a variable, nice heat and I\u2019m just going to let that wash over me for about half hour or so,\u201d a voice narrating the video says. \u201cI feel remarkably better already\u201d. In another post from 10 August 2020, Williamson complains of being \u201cbanned from Facebook\u201d for 30 days because he was \u201csharing an effective treatment for covid-19\u201d. This wasn\u2019t the only time the platform flagged his posts as being misleading. Williamson also accused the social media company of being a \u201cpedophile protector\u201d after a post purporting to out a paedophile ring operating in a local school was taken down. Williamson said he stood by those claims. In November 2021 Williamson falsely claimed online that Queen Elizabeth had suffered an \u201cadverse life ending or permanent life disabling reaction to the poisonous Vaccine\u201d but that this was being covered up by \u201cfake news\u201d. \u201cI bet you all by the end of the week it will be announced that the Queen of England has passed away from an adverse Vaccine Reaction,\u201d he wrote. The Queen died 10 months later at the age of 96. Her death certificate confirmed she died of \u201cold age\u201d. The Labor held seat of Redlands covers bay-side suburbs south of Brisbane and several islands of Moreton Bay, including Coochiemudlo, Macleay, Lamb and Russell islands. Williamson said he moved to Russell Island, which has a population of about 3,700 people and is separated from the mangroves and mudflats of the mainland by less than two kilometres at its nearest point, because of the Covid pandemic. One Nation state election leader James Ashby was contacted Tuesday morning for comment. He requested questions be sent to the party\u2019s media team which did not respond by deadline.

Staff pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 4.9% in the three months to August compared with the same period a year earlier, down from 5.1% in the three months to July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said annual growth in total earnings including bonuses was 3.8% in the three months to August, down from 4.1% for the equivalent period in July. The fall is likely to be seen as a further milestone in the return to normal levels of earnings growth by the Bank of England and a spur to bring down interest rates at a faster pace. However, the ONS said the data was volatile, and especially after a series of one-off bonuses awarded to NHS and civil service staff last year that had fallen out of the annual statistics, dragging down the figures for total earnings by more than would be expected. In a sign of weakness in the labour market, the unemployment rate \u2013 which covers the whole of the UK \u2013 nudged down to 4% in the June to August period, while vacancies fell almost back to the long-term average experienced before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The last time annual pay growth fell below 5% was in June 2022, when the inflation rate had soared to 9.4% in response to rising energy and food prices. The consumer prices index has tracked downwards steadily over the past two years to hit 2% in May before a modest rise during the summer to 2.2% in August. Policymakers at the Bank of England have cut interest rates only once in response to falling inflation \u2013 from 5.25% to 5% \u2013 arguing that the relatively high level of wages could spark a rebound in shop prices. Pressure has mounted from business and consumer groups for further cuts after a slowdown in economic growth, which is expected to be flat in the third quarter of this year after an increase of more than 1% in the first half. Tax rises in Rachel Reeves\u2019s 30 October budget could also drag on economic growth, despite promises of a boost to spending on infrastructure over the rest of the parliament. The chancellor has promised to close a \u00a322bn spending gap she says was inherited from the previous Conservative administration. Reeves is expected to announce several tax rises to narrow the budget deficit, including a higher rate of capital gains tax and an increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions.

Earlier this month Bailey had suggested that the central bank could cut interest rates more aggressively if data showed the economy was slowing. Jake Finney, an economist at PwC UK, said: \u201cThe softening in demand for labour is starting to weigh on wage growth.

      "body": "<p>When confronting diseases such as polio in Gaza and mpox outbreaks in some African countries, we must remember one of the biggest lessons ever learned in global health: women are essential to a solution.</p> <p>Look at polio \u2013 a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus, which can result in disability, paralysis or death. In most countries, vaccinators are predominantly women, and yet women may face barriers in delivering vaccine services due to sexual harassment and violence, unsafe working conditions, poor or irregular pay and heavy workload.</p> <p>These factors must all be taken into account when planning and implementing vaccination programmes as, done right, they expand access substantially. In a nutshell: if we want to eradicate polio, we must identify and overcome gender-related barriers.</p> <p>One successful example for such approaches comes from south-east Africa. In February 2022 \u2013 two years after the entire African continent had been declared polio free \u2013 authorities detected the wild poliovirus in the Malawian capital, Lilongwe. In the following months, health workers in Malawi and four neighbouring countries vaccinated <a href=\"https://polioeradication.org/news/timely-outbreak-response-enhanced-surveillance-halts-wild-poliovirus-transmission-in-southern-africa/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%20nine%20cases,the%20virus%20in%20southern%20Africa.\">more than 50 million</a> children and stepped up surveillance and community outreach. Within 26 months they had ended the outbreak. This response was so successful because it was designed around the roles, attitudes and beliefs of affected women as well as female caregivers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By using such gender-transformative concepts, it will be possible to end polio once and for all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Health workers overcame gender-related barriers to immunisation by leading vaccination teams consisting equally of men and women. In this way, they could reach the affected communities at markets, schools and health facilities. They could foster dialogue with men and women, ensuring everyone was informed to participate in vaccination campaigns. They also identified disparities in the number of boys and girls receiving vaccines, by studying disaggregated data \u2013 and were able to take them into account. Ultimately, this led to improved access to and uptake of vaccines. Today, the continent remains free of the wild poliovirus.</p> <p>By using such gender-transformative concepts, it will be possible to end polio once and for all, even in the last two polio-endemic countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Pakistan, for example, several programmes already include women-centred solutions \u2013 but more <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/en/how-we-work/un-system-coordination/gender-mainstreaming\">gender mainstreaming</a> is necessary and more women need to be at the forefront of campaign planning, elevating the role of women and girls in healthcare and immunisation services.</p> <p>Another example is the fight against the human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus causes cervical cancer \u2013 a disease that kills more than 350,000 women each year, predominantly in low-income countries with insufficient screening and treatment. To promote vaccination, in many places it is necessary to overcome stereotypes associated with immunisation against the virus, which can be transmitted through sexual contact. Several programmes have been creative in addressing these issues. In east Africa, the women-led NGO Girl Effect engages communities. In Nigeria, the influence of first ladies, the wives of state leaders, has built support for vaccination.

      "bodyText": "When confronting diseases such as polio in Gaza and mpox outbreaks in some African countries, we must remember one of the biggest lessons ever learned in global health: women are essential to a solution. Look at polio \u2013 a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus, which can result in disability, paralysis or death. In most countries, vaccinators are predominantly women, and yet women may face barriers in delivering vaccine services due to sexual harassment and violence, unsafe working conditions, poor or irregular pay and heavy workload. These factors must all be taken into account when planning and implementing vaccination programmes as, done right, they expand access substantially. In a nutshell: if we want to eradicate polio, we must identify and overcome gender-related barriers. One successful example for such approaches comes from south-east Africa. In February 2022 \u2013 two years after the entire African continent had been declared polio free \u2013 authorities detected the wild poliovirus in the Malawian capital, Lilongwe. In the following months, health workers in Malawi and four neighbouring countries vaccinated more than 50 million children and stepped up surveillance and community outreach. Within 26 months they had ended the outbreak. This response was so successful because it was designed around the roles, attitudes and beliefs of affected women as well as female caregivers. Health workers overcame gender-related barriers to immunisation by leading vaccination teams consisting equally of men and women. In this way, they could reach the affected communities at markets, schools and health facilities. They could foster dialogue with men and women, ensuring everyone was informed to participate in vaccination campaigns. They also identified disparities in the number of boys and girls receiving vaccines, by studying disaggregated data \u2013 and were able to take them into account. Ultimately, this led to improved access to and uptake of vaccines. Today, the continent remains free of the wild poliovirus. By using such gender-transformative concepts, it will be possible to end polio once and for all, even in the last two polio-endemic countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Pakistan, for example, several programmes already include women-centred solutions \u2013 but more gender mainstreaming is necessary and more women need to be at the forefront of campaign planning, elevating the role of women and girls in healthcare and immunisation services. Another example is the fight against the human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus causes cervical cancer \u2013 a disease that kills more than 350,000 women each year, predominantly in low-income countries with insufficient screening and treatment. To promote vaccination, in many places it is necessary to overcome stereotypes associated with immunisation against the virus, which can be transmitted through sexual contact. Several programmes have been creative in addressing these issues. In east Africa, the women-led NGO Girl Effect engages communities. In Nigeria, the influence of first ladies, the wives of state leaders, has built support for vaccination. Together with easy access, often through schools and colleges, more than 14 million girls in 38 countries were immunised against HPV in 2023, eclipsing the total of the preceding 10 years. From mothers making the choices about the future and health of their families to the underpaid and underappreciated female health workers vaccinating children in challenging and dangerous conditions, women are crucial in achieving the UN\u2019s global health goal, ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all. Now, as we look towards 2030 and the ambition of all the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals, leaders must play their part in making gender equality a reality. Women need to be put at the centre of immunisation programmes. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has a target of vaccinating at least 500 million children between 2026 and 2030, including more than 120 million girls with the HPV vaccine. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has the ambition of ensuring no child anywhere will ever again be paralysed by poliovirus. Both are committed to tackling the injustice that millions of children have never received a single dose of any vaccine. The not-so-secret strategy to achieving these targets is obvious: put women and girls front and centre. This is why we, both global health and gender champions of the GPEI, call for more women in leadership roles to push crucial gender-transformative actions. This week the World Health Summit is being held in Berlin. We call on the leaders attending to show commitment to the progression of gender equality in global health and to make sure all children, wherever they are, have equal access to vaccines.

      "bodyText": "As we approach the end of another jam-packed Tuesday, here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s been keeping us busy: The veteran broadcast journalist George Negus has died at the age of 82. Tributes flowed for the former 60 Minutes host, including from the PM and Ray Martin. The BoM has left Australia on \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a watch\u201d but says climate drivers may no longer deliver expected conditions. Anthony Albanese is buying a new home for himself and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, on the NSW Central Coast. It\u2019s not part of his retirement plan, he stressed. Still, not everyone approved. Jobseeker is now just 20% of the average wage, data released by the Australian Council of Social Service for anti-poverty week has revealed. Australia\u2019s peak humanitarian body decried the \u201clack of consistency\u201d on sanctions. More than 1,000 Palestinians are applying for onshore protection in Australia. Three people were taken to hospital after a minor chemical flash at the University of Sydney. The Coalition refused to give its view on whether UN peacekeepers in Lebanon should be protected from Israeli attacks. Australia\u2019s race discrimination commissioner condemned the white supremacist rally held in Corowa, in regional NSW, at the weekend. Finally, more than 48% of Australia\u2019s low-income households are now experiencing food insecurity. Thank you for joining us. We\u2019ll be back bright and early tomorrow. Placing onus of online safety and privacy on individuals a cover for corporate inaction and bad behaviour: Lizzie O\u2019Shea Staying with the SXSW forum in Sydney, where panellists have been discussing the balance between the right to privacy and the right to remain safe while online: The panel of four, which included the privacy commissioner Carly Kind and digital rights advocate Lizzie O\u2019Shea, agreed that online platforms should not be allowed to hide behind the mantra of personal responsibility. As technology develops, including generative AI, safety mechanisms should be inbuilt into the design, the eSafety commissioner said. O\u2019Shea said slating responsibility for both online safety and online privacy to the individual was merely a cover for continued inaction in the regulatory space and bad corporate behaviour. \u201cWhen you go to the supermarket and buy a tub of yoghurt, you\u2019re not expected to go home and test that it doesn\u2019t have poison in it,\u201d she said. You\u2019re not expected to take responsibility for a large range of relatively important decisions you make about what you put in your body or what you\u2019re exposed to. This is just another example. We have all sorts of ways in which we ask the government to intervene into these dynamics, to shape how the market works, to shape how individuals experience certain products, to hold companies to account when things go wrong. Regulatory balance needed between online safety and privacy, eSafety commissioner tells SXSW A greater level of consistency and regulatory coherence on a global scale is needed to achieve an acceptable balance between the right to privacy and the right to remain safe while online, Australia\u2019s eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, has told a SXSW forum in Sydney. This balance is no more crucial than in the realm of child sexual abuse, she said. \u201cPart of the challenge that we have here is a partially jurisdictional arbitrage by some of the more recalcitrant players \u2026 where we\u2019re creating permissive hosting environments for this terrible content to thrive,\u201d she said. When a company uses a privacy mantra as an excuse not to do something that they are technically capable of doing and achieving, that makes me lose my patience, because we see examples across the industry of technological interventions that can work and can balance the two. But we\u2019re seeing recalcitrance in terms of companies simply seeing a business opportunity, or not wanting to take responsibility. Fellow panellist Michael Slater, professor of criminology at UNSW and the director of Childlight in Australia, said the technology sector had been given free rein for more than two decades. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 25 years in which the technology sector has been empowered, primarily by governments, to do what it wants,\u201d he said. There\u2019s a very legitimate discussion here around privacy, but unfortunately, privacy is also the way \u2013 the language \u2013 that industry uses to defend itself against regulation. Salter said a representative survey of 2,000 men the UNSW undertook last year asked about sexual interest in children, and 4.6% of respondents admitted they would have sexual contact with a child under the age of 12 if they knew they would not be caught. \u201cThat\u2019s a really significant market segment that in other more regulated industries, TV and movies, radio, print \u2026 there is a really restrained capacity for them to profit,\u201d he said. But that\u2019s not true for the technology sector, because emerging out of the libertarianism of the 90s \u2026 a sort of ethos around the internet, emerging from Silicon Valley and the technology sector\u2019s self image, this notion of the internet\u2019s independence from the state means independence from state law, independence from terrestrial law. And by and large, the United States government and governments around the world agreed with that posture, that we will essentially suspend the normal regulatory obligations that we impose on other sectors. So we\u2019re dealing with a multitrillion-dollar business sector that has enjoyed a lack of child protection and other obligations that are evident elsewhere. BoM leaves Australia on \u2018La Ni\u00f1a watch\u2019 but says climate drivers may no longer deliver expected conditions The Bureau of Meteorology has left Australia on a \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a watch\u201d but fewer climate models are now forecasting the phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific will kick into gear this summer. La Ni\u00f1as have historically been associated with cooler and wetter than average conditions from across north-western Australia to the south-east. In an update the bureau said only five of the seven international climate models they surveyed, including its own, were predicting a La Ni\u00f1a would develop in the coming months. The bureau has warned that Australians should pay a little less attention to climate drivers like La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o because the pattern of global heating of the oceans means they might not deliver the kind of conditions they used to. Instead, the bureau\u2019s long-range outlooks gave the best indicators of likely conditions. The bureau\u2019s update said: Global [sea surface temperatures] remain at near-record levels, with temperatures since July being just short of the record temperatures observed during 2023, yet well above all other years since observations began in 1854. The sustained nature of this significant global ocean heat suggests that climate indicators such as [El Nino and La Nina] and [Indian Ocean Dipole] may not necessarily behave or evolve as they have in the past. Ray Martin has just spoken with the ABC about the death of his 60 Minutes peer, George Negus. The veteran broadcaster has died at the age of 82. Martin said Negus was an \u201cextraordinary character and extraordinary journo\u201d. What you saw of Negus on television was what he was like. There was no one quite like George \u2026 I think he became as famous \u2026 because he was worthy of it. He was a very good journo, he was very ethical and a very good storyteller, but an even better bloke. He loved the fact he worked for the ABC, and had a high regard for the ABC and Kerry O\u2019Brien, one of his best mates, as well. But he also was anxious to take that across to commercial television. And because he was such a good communicator, he was bringing issues that were really important but also fairly complex to people who hadn\u2019t seen the before \u2026 He was able to get some of those stories across and the ideas and the issues across in a way that very few journalists can do, and that\u2019s a great credit to who he was. I guess he was unique. He personalised television, or personalised news and current affairs, but not in an opinionated way. I mean, personally, he was highly opinionated, and you\u2019d have to try and tone him down. But on television, he would listen to other people, despite the fact he\u2019d savage prime ministers and politicians whom he thought had done the wrong thing, not because he didn\u2019t agree with them, but because he thought that they\u2019d made mistakes. When it came to journalism, despite all the criticism [from] people who didn\u2019t understand him and disagreed with him, I think George was balanced. I think George did tell both sides of the story. He listened to people who had different opinions to his. He\u2019d berate them and take them on. But nevertheless \u2026 he wasn\u2019t out there as a propagandist, I don\u2019t think ever. I think he was a very good journalist. He certainly treasured the profession, and treasured the fact that you had to be objective and you had to be ethical. George Negus remembered by Nine Entertainment colleagues Nine Entertainment says many of George Negus\u2019s friends and former colleagues at the network are remembering him as \u201ca powerhouse of Australian broadcast journalism\u201d. Negus, who had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, has died at the age of 82. In a statement, Nine said: Negus joined Channel 9 in the late 1970s, legendary producer Gerald Stone recognised his distinctive style and hired George to be one of the founding reporters for the then brand-new current affairs program, 60 Minutes. Along with Ray Martin and Ian Leslie, George instantly became a household name in Australia. He was the reporter with the gruff voice, the big moustache and the bucketload of opinions. George\u2019s trademark way of telling stories ensured he was never accused of being dull. He famously got under the skin of British PM Margaret Thatcher; he flirted with actor Meryl Streep; and he showed his great compassion in an extraordinary interview with Mother Teresa. Nine\u2019s director of television, Michael Healy, said: \u201cToday, Australia lost one of its greatest storytellers. When you watched a George Negus interview it was thoughtful, intelligent, composed. He was always in control.\u201d Kirsty Thomson, 60 Minutes executive producer, said: Everyone at 60 Minutes sends love to George\u2019s family. We are so proud to work at a program that\u2019s always been inspired by George\u2019s trailblazing journalism and globetrotting genius. NSW Young Greens seemingly back vandalism of Labor MP\u2019s office The NSW Young Greens have seemingly backed vandalism to Labor MP Peter Khalil\u2019s office, which occurred early yesterday morning. Victoria police alleged that paint was sprayed and a door was damaged at the MP\u2019s Melbourne electorate office, with an unknown liquid allegedly poured through the door. Khalil said the vandalism included an inverted red triangle, a symbol associated with Hamas and that has been used to indicate Israeli military targets, and that the stench from the unknown substance was \u201cso unbearable that staff immediately closed the door, and five hours later still feel overwhelmed and sick from the intensity\u201d. The NSW Young Greens wrote on Instagram that it considers property damage \u201cas a legitimate form of non-violent direct action\u201d. The NSWYG acknowledges the long standing history of The Greens supporting non-violent direct action. Yesterday, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, denounced the vandalism in a post to X and said \u201cprotests must always be peaceful and non-violent\u201d. Everyone should feel safe at work, and we wish Peter Khalil and his team well after this vandalism overnight. The NSW Greens were contacted for comment. Google says proposed misinformation laws would affect \u2018exercise of lawful speech\u2019 Google, one of the world\u2019s biggest multinational tech companies, has said the Albanese government\u2019s proposed law to counter misinformation would \u201cultimately impact the exercise of lawful speech in Australia\u201d. The law, introduced in September, would give the communications and media regulator more powers to categorise material publicly shared as \u201creasonably verifiable as false, misleading or deceptive and reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm\u201d. In a submission to a parliamentary inquiry into the bill, Google said it was supportive of efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation, but didn\u2019t agree with the government\u2019s approach. The search engine turned tech conglomerate said there weren\u2019t \u201cclear guardrails\u201d for the Australian Communications and Media Authority\u2019s oversight and enforcement powers. Under the bill, ACMA would be given new information-gathering and record-keeping powers to force tech companies to hand over details on how they self-regulate. Elsewhere in its submission, Google also suggested the bill focus on disinformation \u2013 where false information is intentionally and deceptively shared \u2013 rather than misinformation. Its submission said: Unlike misinformation, disinformation involves an intent to deceive and as a result is more objectively assessable. It has been narrowly defined in other instruments around the world, including the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. It is also the class of content that carries the greater risk of harm to Australia. The Australian government has said it is \u201cappalled by the unacceptable deaths of innocent civilians as a result of Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza\u201d. A spokesperson for the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, made the comment this afternoon and reiterated that Australia was calling for civilians to be protected. Wong\u2019s spokesperson added: We also remain gravely concerned by the humanitarian situation in Gaza and UN reports that northern Gaza is increasingly being cut off from essential supplies due to access restrictions imposed by Israeli authorities. This cannot continue. The spokesperson said Israel \u201cmust comply\u201d with the international court of justice\u2019s binding orders, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale in Gaza: Australia has repeatedly conveyed its concerns about the situation in Gaza directly to Israel. Palestinian civilians cannot be made to pay the price for defeating Hamas. We repeat our call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the unconditional release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in the flow of humanitarian assistance. Parties must agree to the plan put forward by the United States and endorsed by the United Nations security council. Delays are costing lives. Man charged with assault on NSW north coast A man has been charged after an alleged assault on New South Wales\u2019 north coast. Emergency services were called to a caravan park on Lawson Street in Byron Bay at about 3:30am, after reports of an assault, NSW police said. A 39-year-old man was found with a serious head injury. He was treated at the scene before being airlifted to Gold Coast university hospital in a critical condition. Another 39-year-old man was arrested at the scene and taken to Byron Bay police Station. He was charged with affray and granted conditional bail to appear before Byron Bay local court in November. PM remembers journalist George Negus as a \u2018wonderful human being\u2019 Another look at some of the tributes that are landing on social media following the announcement of the death of veteran broadcaster George Negus. Anthony Albanese called Negus, who died at the age of 82, \u201ca wonderful human being\u201d. \u201cGeorge sought and served the truth with steely determination and a twinkle in his eye, and along the way, he made even the smallest TV screen feel that much bigger\u201d, he wrote on X. Digital payments \u2018much cheaper than cash\u2019, Labor MP tells ABC amid proposal to scrap debit card transaction fees Over to Afternoon Briefing, where host Greg Jennett is exploring the Labor government\u2019s proposal to scrap debit card surcharges. Jerome Laxale from the Labor-held Sydney seat of Bennelong told the ABC that the argument that digital payment systems had embedded costs held no water. All these arguments fall apart when you compare digital payments to cash. There have been embedded costs for cash for millennia that have been carried in certain ways, particularly by banks \u2013 and even recently banks said they are paying up to $350 million each to circulate cash around. As they should. We know digital payments are effectively much cheaper than cash. We had evidence of that nature at the bank hearing. He said surcharges were a \u201cbyproduct of laws that are now approaching 20 years old. They need updating.\u201d Sydney rail commuters told to allow extra travel time after person seen near tracks at Redfern Sydney Trains has advised commuters to allow extra travel time after a person was seen near the train tracks in Redfern on Tuesday afternoon. Several train lines are experiencing delays due to the incident, including T1, T3, and T8, the Daily Telegraph reports. T2 and T5 were affected but have returned to normal service, according to Sydney Trains. In a social media post, Sydney Trains said: \u201cAllow extra travel time due to a person near the tracks at Redfern earlier. Stops may change at short notice.\u201d Tributes are pouring in for the veteran journalist and broadcaster George Negus, who has died at the age of 82. Journalists and public figures including Kate McClymont, Peter FitzSimons, Phillip Adams and Sandra Sully have all taken to X to share the news. Echoing the comments of many, award-winning investigative journalist McClymont wrote: \u201cVale George Negus, one of the greats.\u201d Author and commentator FitzSimons said: \u201cVale George Negus. Lovely bloke. Larrikin. Tv pioneer. Strong and fearless journalist.\u201d Severe thunderstorm warning for western NSW The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of New South Wales. Residents in the state\u2019s west have been told to expect damaging winds, large hail and heavy rainfall: The bureau earlier warned of possible thunderstorms across much of the country\u2019s south east: Veteran broadcaster George Negus has died at the age of 82. In a statement, Negus\u2019 family said he had Alzheimer\u2019s disease and \u201cpassed away peacefully surrounded by loved ones\u201d, the ABC reports. \u201cDespite the challenges diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s inflict on families, we still shared beautiful times, laughter and happiness together in recent times. \u201cWe also learnt a lot.\u201d The family thanked healthcare workers for their support. Many thanks for joining me on today\u2019s blog, Daisy Dumas will be here to take you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care. Australian shares hit another record high The Australian share market has climbed to another record high, AAP reports, with contributions from the big banks and the major miners. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 58 points, or 0.7%, to 8,310.8 at noon \u2013 its first time ever above 8,300. The broader All Ordinaries was up 55.4 points, or 0.65%, to 8,584.1. Eight of the ASX\u2019s 11 sectors were higher at midday, with energy and utilities lower and consumer staples basically flat. The heavyweight financial sector was the biggest gainer, rising 1.3% as Westpac and CBA both climbed 1.7%, NAB added 1.5% and ANZ gained 0.9%. In the heavyweight mining sector, BHP was up 1.1%, Fortescue had added 2.3% and Rio Tinto had advanced 1.6%. The energy sector was lower after Brent crude slumped to a 12-day low of $US75 a barrel after bearish economic data out of China. Woodside was 1.6% lower, Santos had dropped 1.3% and Whitehaven Coal had dropped 2%. The Australian dollar was buying US67.32c, from US67.41c at Monday\u2019s ASX close. Watch: emergency services respond to chemical flash at Sydney uni As we reported earlier, three people have been taken to hospital after a minor chemical flash at the University of Sydney\u2019s Sports Aquatic Centre in Darlington this morning. One employee and two bystanders were affected by the acid-based chemicals, with one person sustaining burns to his hands. The area has since been secured and analysed, before being decontaminated and rendered safe. Here\u2019s some footage from the scene, thanks to our video team and Fire and Rescue NSW: Opera House to be lit up for King after coronation snub The sails of the Sydney Opera House will be lit up for the upcoming royal visit, AAP reports, despite the New South Wales premier previously axing plans to similarly mark the King\u2019s coronation due to cost. The state government plans to illuminate the landmark at 8pm on Friday with pictures of previous royal visits to Sydney. King Charles III and Queen Camilla will tour the NSW capital and Canberra after landing on Australian soil on 18 October. The green light to illuminate the sails comes almost 18 months after the premier, Chris Minns, dumped plans set by the former Coalition state government to light up the venue for the King\u2019s coronation. The cost of $80,000-$100,000 per night was too much for taxpayers to bear, he said at the time. But Minns today said it was important the King was warmly welcomed during his visit to Sydney, and the \u201cprimary objective\u201d in lighting up the Opera House would be to focus on events taking place in the state capital. The Opera House sails were illuminated for 23 days in 2012 but that ballooned to more than 70 days in 2022, costing taxpayers up to $7m annually. Requests to the government were still increasing and included \u201ctrivial matters\u201d, the premier said previously. Friday\u2019s display will include a four-minute looping montage of images from previous royal visits. Australia\u2019s peak body for humanitarian agencies has accused the Australian government of a lack of consistency in ensuring accountability for human rights violations, citing a failure to impose any sanctions on Israeli government or military officials. The federal government announced today that it was imposing targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on five Iranian individuals linked to Iran\u2019s missile program. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said Iran\u2019s missile program posed \u201ca material threat to regional and international security\u201d and that its ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October \u201cwas a dangerous escalation that increased the risk of a wider regional war\u201d. The Australian Council for International Development (Acfid) said in a statement that it was \u201chorrified at the rising bombardment and civilian death toll in Northern Gaza over the last several days\u201d. The peak body said it \u201curges the Australian government to assert accountability and apply autonomous sanctions on Israeli officials engaged in killing civilians, consistent with the approach it has taken towards other combatants committing war crimes\u201d. Naomi Brooks, the humanitarian lead for Acfid, said: The Australian government has implemented sanctions on 200 Iran-linked individuals and entities. Despite over 40,000 deaths in Gaza, the Australian government has not yet sanctioned any Israeli government or military officials. This now looks like a lack of consistency and proportionality in how we hold governments committing gross human rights violations to account. After over a year of conflict, we have continued to see atrocities throughout Gaza, including horrific scenes at Al-Aqsa hospital where civilians were burned alive. The human toll has been beyond catastrophic. We urgently need a ceasefire. Comment is being sought from the Australian government. Teenager accused of woman\u2019s murder seeks police evidence A teenage boy accused of murdering a grandmother during a carjacking has been granted a court order for prosecutors to disclose all evidence in the case, AAP reports. Vyleen Joan White, 70, died after being stabbed in the chest outside a shopping centre at Redbank Plains, west of Brisbane, on 3 February. Police alleged White was killed during the theft of her 2009 model Hyundai Getz hatchback. A 16-year-old boy from the nearby suburb of Bellbird Park was arrested two days later and charged with one count each of murder and unlawful use of a motor vehicle, and three counts of stealing. The youth\u2019s charges were mentioned in Ipswich children\u2019s court today, but he was not required to appear in person or via video link from custody. Prosecutor Andy Iordache told acting magistrate Paul Byrne she could have a complete brief of evidence ready within three weeks. The youth\u2019s solicitor, Farshad Sarabi, asked Byrne for an order for prosecutors to produce the last items of evidence. Byrne ordered the prosecution to disclose the last items of evidence by 5 November and adjourned the matter until 26 November. Sarabi said outside court that the case was \u201csad for everyone\u201d and \u201cthere are no winners in this situation\u201d. When asked about the time it had taken for evidence to be disclosed, Sarabi said: \u201cI think everyone is frustrated by the delays.\u201d The Bureau of Meteorology has released a severe weather update, with possible severe thunderstorms forecast for much of the southeast: Rock band Oasis has announced a fifth and final Australian concert as part of their 2025 reunion tour, after huge demand. All four stadium shows in Melbourne and Sydney sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale. A fifth and final concert has now been announced for Melbourne\u2019s Marvel Stadium on Monday 4 November. This means Oasis will perform three nights in Melbourne, and two at Accor Stadium in Sydney, on the following dates: Friday 31 October \u2013 Marvel Stadium, Melbourne (SOLD OUT) Saturday 1 November \u2013 Marvel Stadium, Melbourne (SOLD OUT) Monday 4 November \u2013 Marvel Stadium, Melbourne (EXTRA SHOW ADDED) Friday 8 November \u2013 Accor Stadium, Sydney (SOLD OUT) Saturday 9 November \u2013 Accor Stadium, Sydney (SOLD OUT) A statement said there would be a presale for existing registered fans who missed out during the initial presale ballot. Tickets will go on sale for the general public from midday this Friday, 18 October. Bureau of Meteorology releases 2025 weather calendar The Bureau of Meteorology has released its weather calendar for 2025, featuring space weather, a total solar eclipse and an elusive optical effect caused by light bending through fog. The photos traverse throughout Australia\u2019s many climate zones \u2013 from Tasmania\u2019s central highlands in the south to the Arafura Sea off the Northern Territory \u2013 taken by professional and amateur photographers. National community information manager Andrea Peace said the images were selected from more than 500 entries, with each month featuring a different weather phenomenon \u201calongside a meteorological description written by the Bureau\u2019s meteorologists.\u201d The weather calendar is now in its 41st year and can be bought online here. Here are some of the photos featured in this year\u2019s calendar: The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, claims the government\u2019s announcement about banning debit card surcharges was only \u201ca plan for a plan\u201d, criticising Labor for not yet following through on promised reforms to gambling ads and social media age limits. Returning to his earlier press conference in Sydney, Dutton said the Coalition was \u201cvery happy to look at anything the government is going to propose, but it\u2019s not an announcement. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re looking at it and it could come in in 2026.\u201d Australian families need help now from this government. At the moment, it\u2019s a plan for a plan. Dutton went on to note: The government promised to introduce reforms to online gambling \u2013 nothing\u2019s happened. They promised to introduce age verification \u2013 nothing has happened. The government makes all of these announcements, but never delivers anything, and I think this is just the latest example. It\u2019s a line reminiscent of Anthony Albanese\u2019s criticism of Scott Morrison before the last election, accusing the then PM of being \u201call photo op, no follow-up\u201d. Dutton\u2019s opposition seem keen to point out the government\u2019s delay on various promises; in parliament\u2019s question time last week, Coalition MPs asked Labor several questions on the long-delayed gambling ad reforms. Now, 16 months after Peta Murphy\u2019s report recommending a full ad ban, it is unclear when the government will announce its response. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, last week promised a response before the election. More information on chemical flash at University of Sydney Fire and Rescue NSW has just released some more information on the chemical reaction at the University of Sydney, as we flagged a moment ago. The chemical reaction occurred outside the University of Sydney Sports Aquatic Centre in Darlington, about 10am. One employee and two bystanders were affected by the acid-based chemicals, FRNSW said, which were being moved for disposal. One person received burns to his hands and was taken to hospital, and a further two people were also transported as a precaution. The area has since been secured and analysed, before being decontaminated and rendered safe. SafeWork and the NSW EPA have been notified of the incident. The number of Palestinians applying onshore for protection in Australia has surpassed 1,000 since October 2023 as the federal government unveils a new temporary humanitarian pathway option for those fleeing the conflict in Gaza. Home affairs department figures for September, tabled in the Senate yesterday, show 118 from the Palestinian Authority applied for onshore protection visas in September 2024, bringing the total of applications to 1,033 since October 2023. Protection visa applications for Palestinians peaked in July with 176 for the month after steadily rising from January. So far, the figures show none of the protection visas have been granted. Last Thursday, the department published new details about its temporary humanitarian stay visas, allowing newly arrived Palestinians the possibility of a three-year visa. The option is similar to the pathway offered to Ukrainians fleeing the country following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022. The temporary visa is only available by invitation from the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, or any delegates, but those affected by the conflict can fill out an expression of interest form to be considered. The two-step process would see an individual being granted a subclass 449 Humanitarian Stay (Temporary) visa initially \u2013 a visa that does not grant Medicare access. Individuals would then be offered a subclass 786 Temporary (Humanitarian Concern) visa, which is valid for three years. The department warned \u201cindividuals who are offered a temporary humanitarian stay cannot meet the criteria for and be granted a protection visa, regardless of whether they have already lodged an application\u201d. Guardian Australia asked Burke for the number of individuals offered a 449 or 786 visa through the pathway on Friday. The minister\u2019s office declined to comment. Three people have been taken to hospital after a minor chemical flash at the University of Sydney. Fire and Rescue NSW said it was called to the workplace incident just before 10am today, along with paramedics, after reports one person had suffered burns from a chemical reaction. He has been taken to Royal Prince Alfred hospital with minor burns, after \u201cexposure to the vapour cloud that came off the reaction\u201d inside a plastic bucket. Two other people were transported to RPA as a precaution. FRNSW crews are working to decontaminate areas where people washed-off after the chemical flash \u2013 described as a \u201crapid release of heat\u201d. We\u2019ve actually just recovered the remaining product of the chemicals that have been mixed together and put them into proper storage recovery bins \u2026 Now we\u2019re just working through to continue to decontaminate so we can open this site back up. NSW Ambulance confirmed it had transported the three patients, but did not have an update on their condition. Max Chandler-Mather hits out at \u2018property investor\u2019 PM The Greens MP and housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, has weighed in on Anthony Albanese\u2019s purchase of a home on New South Wales\u2019 Central Coast with his fiancee, Jodie Haydon. In a post to X labelling the prime minister a \u201cproperty investor\u201d, Chandler-Mather said: Labor [and] the Liberals have created a housing system where a property investor can buy a $4.3m beachfront home, while millions can\u2019t even find an affordable rental, let alone buy a house of their own. Yet Labor still want to give property investors $176bn in tax handouts. Coalition silent on peacekeeper safety in Lebanon The Coalition has refused to give its view on whether UN peacekeepers in Lebanon should be protected from Israeli attacks. As reported here on the blog yesterday, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade gave a statement to Guardian Australia saying that Australia had \u201cmade clear to Israel that any targeting or intimidation of UN personnel and facilities in Lebanon is unacceptable and must cease\u201d. There have been further developments overnight, including the UN security council issuing a statement urging \u201call parties to respect the safety and security of Unifil personnel and premises\u201d and saying \u201cUN peacekeepers and UN premises must never be the target of an attack\u201d. The foreign affairs ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the UK also issued a joint statement expressing \u201cour deep concern in the wake of recent attacks by [the Israel Defense Forces] on Unifil bases, which have left several peacekeepers injured\u201d and that \u201cthese attacks must stop immediately\u201d. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, denied accusations that Israel \u201cdeliberately attacked Unifil personnel\u201d but said \u201cthe best way to assure the safety of Unifil personnel is for Unifil to heed Israel\u2019s request and to temporarily get out of harm\u2019s way\u201d. Today Guardian Australia asked the opposition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, for comment about the protection of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, including whether the Australian government was right to make the call it did and whether Unifil was right to reject unilateral calls to move. Birmingham\u2019s office said that they would not be providing comment. Overseas arrivals and departures figures released The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released its latest overseas arrivals and departures figures. Permanent arrivals in August were down from the same month last year but are up about a third from 2019. Short-term visitors were up 9.2% on last year, with most tourists coming from New Zealand, China and Japan. In New South Wales and Victoria, China was the No 1 source country for tourists. In Tasmania and Western Australia, the tourist market was dominated by Singaporeans. More residents are holidaying overseas, with short-term resident returns up to 916,890 \u2013 an increase of 6.8% on one year earlier. For these people, at least, the cost-of-living crisis may not be hitting home. But more people chose to leave and not return to Australia. Total departures were well up, increasing to 1,694,440 \u2013 an increase of 11.7% on one year earlier. The PM has been asked about his purchase of a home on New South Wales\u2019 Central Coast with his fiancee, Jodie Haydon. Well, Jodie and I are getting married, as is known, and I\u2019m pleased about that. And Jodie\u2019s a Coastie. She\u2019s a proud Coastie \u2026 There are three generations of Haydons on the coast there. And when your relationship changes, your life changes, and you make decisions. He said he was yet to buy the Copacabana home and, when asked if he planned to retire there, he said he was \u201cplanning to be in [his] current role for a very long time\u201d. Clare O\u2019Neil says Labor \u2018came from a standing start\u2019 on housing crisis The prime minister is in Queensland, where he has been lending his weight to the Miles government\u2019s re-election campaign. Speaking alongside the housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, in Logan, he has just announced a planned 1,100 new homes for the area as part of the government\u2019s target to build 1.2m homes around the country over the next five years. O\u2019Neil said: We are, without question, one of the boldest and most ambitious commonwealth governments on housing that we have seen for a generation in this country. We came from a standing start. The prime minister here mentioned that for most of the time the Coalition were in power, they didn\u2019t even have a housing minister. Didn\u2019t even have a housing minister: that\u2019s how tapped out they were on this critical problem. When asked about Labor\u2019s plan to drop debit card fees, Anthony Albanese said: We think it\u2019ll make a difference. And when people go and they see a price up on the board and the business where they\u2019re making a purchase, that should be the purchase price. There shouldn\u2019t be hidden charges and surcharges there when people are using their own money \u2026 The debit card is taking money directly from people\u2019s accounts. That is their money, and there shouldn\u2019t be surcharges on it. More information on latest jobseeker data Currently, 60% of households relying on jobseeker live below the poverty line. Acoss is urging the federal government to increase Jobseeker from $56 a day to at least $82 a day to bring it in line with the pension. Jobseeker and related income support payments should be indexed to the higher of wage growth or inflation, instead of just inflation, Goldie said: As prices continue to rise and wages increase, it is vital that unemployment and related payments are adjusted to reflect the reality of living costs. We cannot allow people out of paid work to fall further behind, pushing more people into poverty. Acoss is also advocating for a strategy to halve poverty by 2030, including setting national targets and definitions of poverty, increasing investment in social housing and First Nations organisations and creating more employment opportunities for those facing barriers to paid work. Jobseeker is now just 20% of the average wage, data released by Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) for anti-poverty week has revealed. While the average wage in Australia is $1,923 a week, jobseeker is just $393, the Acoss briefing on solutions to poverty shows. The payment is only 43% of the $916-per-week minimum wage, and has dropped to just 69% of the $572-per-week pension. Youth Allowance at $319.50 a week is even lower, making up just 17% of the average wage, 35% of the minimum wage and 56% of the pension. It is also far below the Henderson poverty line, which is $1,224.94 a fortnight for a single person. The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said it was time to raise the rate: Australia\u2019s totally inadequate income support payments are a primary cause of poverty in one of the wealthiest nations on Earth. Our unemployment payment is among the lowest in the OECD. It is a political choice and driving persistent poverty. People receiving youth allowance or jobseeker are falling further behind both people in paid work and pensioners. Every day, people doing it tough are forced to go hungry, forgo essential medicine, and worry about finding or keeping a roof over their head. One of the quickest and most effective ways to lift people out of poverty is to raise the rate. Race discrimination commissioner condemns white supremacist rally at the weekend Australia\u2019s Race Discrimination Commissioner, Giridharan Sivaraman, has condemned the white supremacist rally held in Corowa, in regional NSW, at the weekend. On Sunday, a group of balaclava-wearing men were spotted huddled under a sign that read \u201cwhite man fight back\u201d. A video posted online showed the group\u2019s leader suggesting white people were being \u201cpushed out\u201d of their towns. Sivaraman said the Corowa rally was \u201ca shock to many, particularly residents\u201d, but for those who have been \u201cfollowing the rise of the far right in the last few years, it sadly wasn\u2019t that surprising\u201d. This is what happens when we refuse to properly name and confront the extent of racism that is ingrained across our society. These rallies are a horrific manifestation of what happens when racism is normalised \u2013 to the extent that neo-Nazis are emboldened to be on the streets as a threatening force \u2026 White supremacy is a threat that must be taken seriously. We should never forget that the worst mass murder in recent history committed by an Australian was a white supremacist in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019. Politicians need to be careful their language does not denigrate one community over another or embolden neo-Nazis to openly march on our streets. Australian media also needs to be careful about which ideologies it platforms. He called for a national anti-racism action that \u201caddresses the roots of white supremacy and all forms of racism in Australia\u201d. Dandenong MP shaving head to raise money for Cancer Council Victoria Dandenong MP Gabrielle Williams is about to shave her head to raise money for Cancer Council Victoria, after her friend and Mulgrave MP Eden Foster\u2019s cancer diagnosis earlier this year. Peter Dutton says Anthony Albanese\u2019s purchase of a $4.3m luxury coastal home north of Sydney is \u201ca matter for the prime minister\u201d, but said he had concerns about ordinary Australians struggling with their mortgage. In a press conference in Sydney, Dutton was asked about Albanese\u2019s latest property purchase at Copacabana. Dutton responded: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter for the prime minister, but I wish he and Jodie [Haydon, his fiance] well, and they\u2019re obviously planning for the next stage of life, post-politics. And I wish them well.\u201d Dutton said \u201cthe prime minister can answer questions in relation to it\u201d but went on to say: But the homeowners in Australia that I\u2019m worried about at the moment are people who can\u2019t afford their mortgages. People have had 12 interest rate increases, and interest rates should come back, as they\u2019re doing in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand, but because of Mr Albanese\u2019s bad economic management, we\u2019re seeing inflation remain higher here and therefore, interest rates remain higher as well. Pesutto rubbishes claims from Allan he is untrustworthy Circling back to Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto, who has rubbished suggestions made by the premier, Jacinta Allan, that he was untrustworthy. As she arrived at parliament this morning, Allan had said: For weeks the Liberal party have been slugging it out in court with each other, contesting the question of John Pesutto\u2019s character, and it is being exposed as being entirely untrustworthy \u2026 His own colleagues think that and it demonstrates that Victorians can neither trust him or the Victorian Liberal party. But Pesutto disputed this characterisation and said he would not stoop to \u201cpersonal attacks\u201d. My focus is on what the Victorian people need, and I\u2019d like some answers from the premier on a range of issues. Laneway says presale \u2018issue\u2019 now resolved Circling back to the Laneway presale for a moment: in a post to its update channel on Instagram, Laneway says it is \u201caware of an issue with the pre-sale journey\u201d. We have been made aware of an issue with the pre-sale journey, which should now be resolved and everyone should be able to purchase. Laneway is encouraging those who are struggling to clear their cache, try incognito mode or use a different browser. Pesutto says he will continue to \u2018work hard\u2019 for Liberal leadership John Pesutto says he was \u201cbrought up to be very resilient\u201d and would continue to \u201cwork hard for everything\u201d, including the Liberal leadership. Asked whether today\u2019s meeting put leadership speculation to bed, or if he believes this uncertainty will continue until the trial is over and the findings released, John Pesutto said: I\u2019m just going to focus on my job and working with tenacity to give the Victorian people a real choice, both now and in November 2026 and that requires a lot of work from my colleagues and I. I think what I\u2019d say about my colleagues today is that we\u2019ve come out of our meeting today with a real sense of the purpose we have in the mission we have, which is to replace this government, but to do it for the reasons that we need better leadership of our state. Pesutto bats off question about Liberal spill after trial wraps up Asked whether Liberal MPs have indicated a spill will go ahead after the trial wraps up, John Pesutto batted off the question. He said opposition is \u201ca long journey and we are focused on the work ahead\u201d. That\u2019s all we can really do ... Coming out of today\u2019s meeting, there\u2019s a real sense of purpose and mission that we are having an impact on the debate in the state, and we need change in the state, and we need better leadership in the state. \u2018I\u2019m not going to go into party room matters,\u2019 Pesutto says John Pesutto said he won\u2019t discuss party matters, but admitted he raised the defamation trial with Liberal MPs as part of his \u201crecap of the last month\u201d. I\u2019m not going to go into party room matters, as you can appreciate. But look, I\u2019m happy to say there was just a general recap on where we\u2019ve been going, with particular focus on the fact that we\u2019re resonating with the Victorian people. It is clear that the Allan Labor government is losing support at a rapid rate \u2013 and that\u2019s right across the state, and there\u2019s good reason for that. Pesutto confirms spill motion against him failed to eventuate Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, has just emerged from the Liberal party room after a spill against him failed to eventuate. Several MPs had spent last week planning a spill, citing Pesutto\u2019s ongoing defamation trial brought Moira Deeming as a reason, but it failed to go ahead as they were unable to agree upon a replacement candidate. Emerging from the party room, Pesutto confirmed there was no spill: I don\u2019t know what all that was about but everybody\u2019s focused on the job ahead. We\u2019ve got a government that is not leading our state well. We\u2019ve got roads in a state of disrepair that are dangerous for people to use. The health system hasn\u2019t been fixed. The budget is a mess. Debt is continuing to rise in this state, putting enormous pressure on Victorian households and businesses. So there is a lot to prosecute here in the parliament. Update on Oasis and Laneway tickets queue If you\u2019re wondering whether you have the time to queue up online for Oasis tickets, our spy says don\u2019t worry: the two Melbourne concerts just went on general sale, there are still seats available all over the stadium, and there\u2019s no online queue. On the other hand, another spy is #24,698 in the queue for Laneway in Sydney, and another is #36,485 for the Melbourne stop, so yet again gen X have an unfair advantage over the millennials in getting what they want. Images of storm damage in Sydney and surrounds The NSW State Emergency Service has shared these images of the storm damage in Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Illawarra and surrounds yesterday afternoon: Expansion of NSW entertainment precincts to protect venues from noise complaints People who buy homes near pubs and music venues in some areas will be discouraged from making noise complaints, AAP reports, as special entertainment precincts will be expanded in the NSW government\u2019s second tranche of \u201cvibrancy reforms\u201d \u2013 to be introduced to parliament today. Buyers will be required to formally acknowledge they are purchasing property in an entertainment zone when snapping up real estate within the precincts. Just one precinct has been established to date, on Enmore Road in Sydney\u2019s inner west, but the arts minister, John Graham, wants more in a bid to revive the state\u2019s ailing nightlife industry. It is about cutting the red tape that has strangled nightlife over time and made local live music and performance at venues in many cases the exception rather than the rule. It is also hoped the laws will put an end to conflict between established venues and new neighbours. Graham said: People moving into an established entertainment zone will now do so with their eyes wide open through property search documents and we expect this will reduce conflict between neighbours and venues over time. Allan says \u2018existing engagements\u2019 means she can\u2019t attend King Charles\u2019 reception in Canberra The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has been asked why she and the other state premiers have declined their invitations for a reception in Canberra next Monday to mark King Charles\u2019s first visit to Australia since taking the throne. She said she has a number of \u201cexisiting engagements\u201d: The Victorian community will be very well represented by the governor, by the King\u2019s representative in the state. The government will further be represented by the parliamentary secretary to the premier. Despite this she said she welcomed the King\u2019s trip and \u201cwe would have warmly welcomed him to Melbourne and Victoria should his itinerary have made some time and space for that visit\u201d. \u2026 particularly given the King went to school here in Geelong and we\u2019re really proud of that personal connection with the King and his family. His schedule was such that his visit is confined to Canberra and Sydney, and my schedule is such that I\u2019m just not able to make the reception next Monday, but the government [and] the Victorian community, will be very, very well represented by the governor of Victoria, who is indeed the King\u2019s representative. But Allan was quick to note she has \u201clong been on the record as supporting Australia becoming a republic\u201d, though it was not a focus \u201cright now\u201d. An offender has fled the scene of a botched ram raid at a cycling store with their arm on fire after the business erupted into flames, AAP reports. Mystery culprits allegedly used a stolen car to ram the garage door of a business on Lygon Street, Brunswick, in Melbourne\u2019s inner north about 2.55am this morning, police said. It is believed the offenders used the black BMW X5 to ram the door two or three times, before jumping out of the vehicle and entering the store. The ramming then led to a fire inside the business. It was reported to police that one of the offenders was spotted fleeing the scene with one of their arms on fire. The stolen vehicle was left behind and the offenders were last seen running towards Nicholson Street. The fire caused significant damage to the building and it remains unclear if anything was stolen from the store. Oasis general sale to begin shortly, plus Laneway presale The general public sale for the 2025 reunion tour of 90s rock band Oasis go on sale in just over 10 minutes. According to Ticketmaster, tickets have been priced in advance by the tour from $183.28 to $407.57. A handling fee from $9.90 per order also applies, and tickets are subject to availability. Ticketmaster says if anyone gets a message they were unable to reserve their chosen seats, it means someone has already secured them \u2013 and they should clear their selection and try different seats. Meanwhile, presale for the 2025 Laneway festival also opens from 10am AEDT, with the festival to be headlined by Charli xcx. Man charged with 87 counts of theft allegedly part of syndicate Victoria police have charged a man who was allegedly part of a retail theft syndicate. Detectives travelled to NSW on 11 October to investigate reports of a large shop steal syndicate, allegedly responsible for thefts of grocery products last year and this year. It\u2019s alleged the group were conducting large-scale thefts of high-value products from supermarkets, Victoria police said, worth more than $3m. Detectives will allege the 27-year-old Indian national was part of the syndicate of more than 100 people. He was extradited from NSW and charged with 87 counts of theft. Australia must \u2018exercise all political and diplomatic influence\u2019 to ensure humanitarian aid to Gaza, says Save the Children Save the Children Australia is urging the Albanese government to \u201cexercise all political and diplomatic influence it has\u201d to stop Israel from cutting humanitarian aid to children and families trapped in northern Gaza. On Saturday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) renewed its evacuation orders for Palestinians still living in the decimated northern half of Gaza. The UN says an estimated 400,000 people are trapped by the latest ground fighting and artillery fire centred in Jabalia, which has now entered a second week. Save the Children Australia CEO Mat Tinkler said: The Australian Government must state loud and clear that using starvation as a weapon of war is a war crime and that perpetrators have to be held accountable. As is so often the case in conflict, the people least able to evacuate will be children (particularly those who have been orphaned) the elderly, the sick and injured and people with disabilities. If aid is cut off, the denial of food, water and medicine to these people will effectively be signing their death warrants. Save the Children says that according to the UN World Food Program, no food aid has entered northern Gaza since 1 October. Circling back to Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young\u2019s interview on ABC RN earlier where she was asked about the ticketing situation for live music \u2013 and said she was worried by some of the allegations aired on Four Corners last night. Hanson-Young said she was concerned by the notion \u201caudience members are [allegedly] being ripped off because of price surging on tickets or hidden fees on ticket prices.\u201d If there is issues there, the ACCC should investigate them and make clear that any anti-competitive or unfair charges are not happening and being passed on to audience members. The Senator said the live music industry is \u201ccopping it from all sides right now\u201d, still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and dealing with the cost-of-living crisis. I do think the ACCC should have a look at this and work out if there\u2019s unfair practices. But I also think governments need to do more to support Australian musicians and artists. We are on the verge of losing an entire generation of artists in this country because of these issues and, you know, it\u2019s such an important part of what makes us the great country that we are. Art helps us understand what we\u2019re going through, where we\u2019ve come from, where we\u2019re going. It helps us to communicate, to connect. There\u2019s a lot of pressures right now and music and art really helps us as a community to come together when times are tough and we need it more than ever right now. The Liberal party room has just wrapped up with no spill motion, as we had earlier reported. MPs have told Guardian Australia the 45-minute meeting was \u201cfriendly\u201d, \u201cagreeable\u201d, \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cnothing special\u201d. Leader in the upper house, Georgie Crozier, said only Pesutto mentioned the defamation trial \u201cin passing\u201d. We\u2019re putting it behind us. She said \u201cnot one\u201d MP raised concerns about Pesutto\u2019s leadership. Woman charged with domestic violence murder after man allegedly found unconscious Queensland police have charged a 32-year-old woman with murder after the sudden death of a man at Browns Plains yesterday. Emergency services were called to the Basie Court address after the 72-year-old man was allegedly found unconscious and not breathing. Police said the 32-year-old Browns Plains woman was taken into custody at the scene, and has since been charged with murder (domestic violence). She is due to appear in Beenleigh magistrates court today. Investigations are ongoing, police said. Residential vacancy rates fell slightly in September: SQM research Residential dwelling vacancy rates fell slightly across the country to 1.2% in September, according to SQM Research. There are currently 37,932 rental vacancies, a decrease from 39,665 in August. Perth, Canberra and Hobart \u2013 plus regional Australia \u2013 were the main drivers to the decline, according to the data. Sydney\u2019s rental vacancy rate remains stable at 1.6% with 11,360 vacant rentals. Melbourne\u2019s has increased to 1.7% with 8,796 vacant dwellings. Canberra had the highest rental vacancy rate among the states and territories at 2%. Vacancy rates in the CBDs were largely steady, with Sydney at a 5% vacancy rate and Melbourne at 5.1%. In the month leading to 12 October, rental prices in capital cities rose by 0.5%. Sydney experienced a 0.9% increase in combined rents, where Melbourne saw a 1.1% decline. Louis Christopher, the managing director of SQM Research, said the national rental market \u201cremains in severe shortage and barring some exceptions, is not expected to materially soften out of the rental crisis for some years\u201d. Victorian Liberal MPs are filing into their party room for their first meeting since the beginning of the defamation trial brought against opposition leader, John Pesutto, by exiled MP Moira Deeming. The trial, which has aired the party\u2019s dirty laundry, prompted calls last week from some MPs to spill the leadership. However, several MPs have told Guardian Australia the motion is unlikely to go ahead because the party room is unable to agree upon a candidate to replace Pesutto. Pesutto walked into his party room with members of his leadership team, Georgie Crozier, Evan Mulholland and David Southwick, and South West Coast MP, Roma Britnell. He told reporters: \u201cBack to work.\u201d The Berwick MP, Brad Battin, who has long been touted as a possible leader, was the first to arrive and said he had no plans to move a motion. Another contender, Nepean MP Sam Groth, said: \u201cYou\u2019re all wasting your time.\u201d Guy Barnett has been elected as Tasmania\u2019s new deputy premier. The Tasmanian government whip, Simon Wood, said in a statement the Liberal party met this morning to elect a new deputy leader, and Barnett was elected unopposed. This comes as the former deputy premier, Michael Ferguson, was set to face a no-confidence motion in parliament today but resigned from the cabinet over the bungled Bass Strait ferry rollout. Barnett spent nearly a decade in the federal Senate before being elected to Tasmanian state parliament in 2014 as the member for Lyons. Albanese buys house on NSW Central Coast for $4.3m News.com.au is reporting that Anthony Albanese has purchased a new home for himself and fiance, Jodie Haydon, at Copacabana on the NSW Central Coast for $4.3m. 2GB\u2019s Ben Fordham reportedly revealed the sale and says the prime minister exchanged contracts in September, with settlement expected before the end of October. Albanese had told Fordham: I\u2019m about to get marred to Jodie and start a new chapter of our lives. Jodie\u2019s a \u2018coastie\u2019 and spending time with her up there is awesome. It will be nice to be closer to her parents and her family one day. News.com.au reports that the four-bedroom, three-bathroom home was sold for $1.7m in 2017 and $4.65m in 2021 \u2013 on the market for almost a full year before Albanese bought it for more than $300,000 cheaper than what the current owners paid. In May, Albanese defended his decision to evict the tenant from a house he owns in Sydney, saying he has been \u201cmore than fair\u201d as a landlord but his impending marriage means he wants to sell: Smart energy trial for parts of Illawarra The Albanese government has announced a smart energy trial in the NSW Illawarra to help boost household electrification. Backed by $5.4m in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), residents in the 2515 postcode will be able to apply for subsidies for a range of devices. A statement from energy minister, Chris Bowen, says energy-efficient electric appliances will be installed in participating homes in Austinmer, Clifton, Coledale, Scarborough, Thirroul and Wombarra, along with a smart energy management device to optimise energy use. Arena funding will help households buy heat pump hot water and space heating systems, plus batteries and other resources. The project aims to generate insights into consumer behaviour, attitudes and energy bill savings to inform how home electrification could be scaled across Australia. The MP for Cunningham, Alison Byrnes, said: I look forward to seeing this project provide valuable insights and data in how this model could be rolled out across communities, particularly our more vulnerable households in lower socioeconomic areas who would benefit greatly from reduced energy bills. Four flood rescues amid rapid onset storm in Sydney yesterday The NSW SES assistant commissioner, Colin Malone, says four flood rescues occurred yesterday, after people drove into floodwaters in Sydney. He spoke with ABC News Breakfast about the storms that lashed Sydney and eastern parts of the country yesterday, and said there were 118 incidents \u2013 with 330 volunteers working into the evening. This is normal as we head into the summer thunderstorm period. We\u2019ve heard this morning on the news already that Sydney will have heavy rain this morning that will upset peak-hour traffic \u2026 Our message is no one\u2019s life is worth the risk of driving through floodwater \u2026 Turn around, rethink it and prioritise your family and your own life before entering flood water. Residential rental increases will be capped at once per year, under changes being introduced through the New South Wales parliament today. The rule would cover renters under periodic and fixed-term leases, fixing a loophole in the law. The proposal is being put forward as part of the Labor government\u2019s rental reform package, which also includes change to make it easier to keep pets in rentals and ending no grounds evictions. The better regulation minister, Anoulack Chanthivong, said: Ensuring renters can only be hit with one rent increase a year will provide greater certainty and protection for renters regardless of whether their lease type changes. Police search bushland amid investigation into Wollongong woman who went missing three decades ago NSW police have searched bushland in the Illawarra as they investigate the suspicious disappearance of a Wollongong woman 30 years ago. Strike Force Athena was established in 2022 to re-established the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Pauline Sowry, also known by her married name of Pauline Lawrence. She was 49 years old when last seen by her family in the northern suburbs of Wollongong in December 1993. Her whereabouts remain unknown. A 2008 coronial inquest found she had died, most likely after an unconfirmed sighting in 1994. Police said that following new information, a bushland search recommenced in the Illawarra escarpment at Figtree, south of Wollongong, last week. Pauline\u2019s son Jason Lawrence said it\u2019s been incredibly difficult for the family not knowing what happened to their mother and sister. We\u2019ve been robbed of not knowing my mother, I\u2019ve been robbed of not seeing what I\u2019ve become over the years, how strong I\u2019ve been, my career, my children. I\u2019ve been robbed of a mother and robbed of a grandmother to my children. I\u2019ve been robbed of a normal life, I don\u2019t wish it on anybody. It would be really good to get some closure and know that she didn\u2019t leave us and something had happened. Will take \u2018months, if not years\u2019 for families to bounce back Continuing from our last post, the Foodbank Australia CEO, Brianna Casey, said families were making \u201cunimaginable choices\u201d. This is an alarming statistic that demonstrates just how desperate the situation has become for those who were once a lifeline suddenly finding themselves living pay to pay, watching every dollar and sadly, no longer in a position to extend help to loved ones and friends. We know it\u2019s going to take months, if not years, for many families to bounce back. We will continue to wrap our arms around our communities for as long as it takes, doing our bit to help nutritious, culturally appropriate food get to as many struggling households as possible. More than half (53%) of food insecure households reported they are receiving food relief more often than a year ago. Food insecure households receiving help from friends and family has dropped significantly from 32% in 2023 to 25% in 2024. Highest rates of food insecurity for low-income earners since onset of cost-of-living crisis, Foodbank says Low-income households are enduring the highest rates of food insecurity since the onset of the cost-of-living crisis, according to the Foodbank Hunger Report 2024, released today. Now in its 11th year, the report from food relief organisation Foodbank surveyed 4,260 people and highlights the growing divide between those who are able to absorb or adapt to rising costs and those being left behind. More than 870,000 (48%) of Australia\u2019s low-income households \u2013 earning less than $30,000 \u2013 are experiencing food insecurity. This is the highest rate since the onset of the cost-of-living crisis, up 5% on 2022. The report offers an insight into the state of hunger across the country and reveals more than half (59%) of all food insecure households are experiencing the most severe level of hardship, regularly skipping meals or going entire days without food. Single-parent households are the hardest hit with over two-thirds (69%) facing food insecurity and 41% of these also experiencing the severest form. The federal government has announced targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on five Iranian individuals it says is \u201ccontributing to Iran\u2019s missile program.\u201d A statement from the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said Iran\u2019s missile program \u201cposes a material threat to regional and international security\u201d, with the 1 October attack on Israel a \u201cdangerous escalation that increased the risk of a wider regional war.\u201d The sanctions target two directors and a senior official in Iran\u2019s Aerospace Industries Organization, the director of the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group and the commercial director of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group. The Albanese government has now sanctioned 200-Iran linked individuals and entities, the statement said. Australia will continue to hold Iran to account for its reckless and destabilising actions. Tasmanian opposition weighs in after Ferguson resigns from cabinet Tasmania\u2019s opposition leader, Dean Winter, has also been speaking with ABC News Breakfast this morning \u2013 after news the deputy premier has quit cabinet over the bungled Bass Strait ferry rollout. Winter was set to move the motion of no-confidence in Michael Ferguson when parliament sits today. Asked about comments from the premier, Jeremy Rockliff, that he is undermining the functioning of the state\u2019s parliament, Winter responded: We\u2019re holding ministers accountable when the premier of Tasmania refused to. This project \u2013 for people who don\u2019t know \u2013 is $500m over budget, five years delayed. It\u2019s a completely debacle. Someone needed to take responsibility. The premier [was] saying he wouldn\u2019t do that, the parliament decided it would act and, at the last moment, the deputy premier resigned. Asked if Ferguson had paid too high a price, Winter said, \u201cthe price is being paid by Tasmania\u2019s tourism and hospitality industry\u201d, and that \u201che\u2019s still on the backbench\u201d. Greens senator on government plan to ban debit card fees Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young is speaking with ABC News Breakfast about the federal government plan to ban debit card fees and instruct the consumer watchdog to investigate excessive card costs. Hanson-Young said she doesn\u2019t think the move \u201cgoes far enough\u201d, and she worries the government is \u201csquibbing it on credit cards.\u201d This is only for debit cards. A lot of people are paying for their groceries and everyday items with their credit card and being slugged fees as well. I think we need to make sure it\u2019s the bank that covers the cost of this, not the consumer and not the small businesses. She said the Greens would look at what the government is proposing in detail. Olivia Rodrigo falls through stage platform Gen Z popstar Olivia Rodrigo is halfway through the Australian leg of her tour, and made headlines overnight after falling at her Melbourne show. In a video posted to social media, Rodrigo can be seen falling through an open platform on the stage. She did not appear injured, getting right back up and saying: Oh my God, that was fun! I\u2019m OK. Woah. Sometime\u2019s there\u2019s just a hole in the stage. That\u2019s alright. OK. Where was I? Rodrigo performed four shows at Melbourne\u2019s Rod Laver Arena \u2013 with last night being her fourth. She will perform at Sydney\u2019s Qudos Bank Arena on 17, 18, 21, and 22 October. Australia has responded to calls to help the people of Myanmar suffering under its military junta and announced $9m in aid for food, water and shelter on top of education and health services. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, announced the package alongside Sean Turnell, who was a political prisoner of the junta for 650 days, as she launched his book about the situation in Myanmar in Canberra yesterday. At least 5,350 civilians had been killed and half the nation was living under the poverty line, primarily due to military violence since the 2021 coup, Senator Wong said. We are all appalled by the reports of widespread human rights abuses and atrocities. And happy Tuesday \u2013 many thanks to Martin for kicking things off. I\u2019m Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be with you for most of today\u2019s blog. You can reach out with any tips or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s go. Slavery reparations not on the agenda for Chogm summit in Samoa The issue of reparations for slavery is not on the agenda for next week\u2019s Commonwealth heads of government summit, and the UK is not considering paying up, Downing Street has said. We report today that the stance could put the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who will attend the gathering in Samoa along with Anthony Albanese and other heads of government of the 54-nation bloc, on a collision course with other countries. All three candidates to succeed Patricia Scotland as Chogm secretary general at the event have said they support reparations for countries affected by slavery and colonisation. Here\u2019s the full report: HSC written exams start today A record number of students will be waking up with nerves in New South Wales this morning, with the formal written exam period to begin. More than 76,000 students will be sitting an HSC exam, to run over the next 19 days. In total, 124 exams will be sat, starting with English at 9.50am. Atars will then be delivered on Wednesday 18 December \u2013 with half of the mark derived from the exam period. The deputy premier and minister for education, Prue Car, advised students to \u201ctrust the hard work you\u2019ve done\u201d. All the best to the HSC class of 2024 \u2013 the largest high school cohort in the country and in NSW history \u2013 as you head into written exams. Thank you to all of the teachers who have been part of this cohort\u2019s 13-year education. I know every teacher and parent is looking on with pride today as these young people take this big step in their educational journey. The NSW Education Standards Authority chief, Paul Martin, said the exam period would be a \u201chuge logistical operation\u201d for schools and staff. My message to students: there are many ways to reach your goals. Be passionate, be curious and feel confident in all that you have learned over the last 13 years. Tasmania\u2019s minority Liberal government is again in crisis after the deputy premier quit cabinet over the bungled Bass Strait ferry rollout, AAP reports. Michael Ferguson was set to face a no-confidence motion in parliament today over delays and cost blowouts to the delivery of new $900m Spirit of Tasmania ships. That was set to carry, with crossbench MPs queuing up to back the Labor opposition. He instead bowed to the pressure last night by resigning as treasurer along with giving up his small business and consumer affairs portfolios. It is the latest headache for Jeremy Rockliff\u2019s Liberals who were plunged into minority in May 2023 and called an early March election only to be returned in minority with a more diverse cross bench. New berths for the two Spirit vessels won\u2019t be ready for their arrival in what the state Labor opposition has dubbed the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in Tasmania\u2019s history. Ferguson said in a statement: I want to thank my Liberal party colleagues for their continued support for me over the past 20 years \u2013 and during my time as a minister in cabinet. I want to thank the premier [Jeremy Rockliff] for his support and backing over the past few months \u2013 both personally and as a colleague \u2013 this friendship is one that I have returned to him during my time as his deputy premier. The Labor leader, Dean Winter, was set to move the no-confidence motion when parliament sits today. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then my colleague Emily Wind will take you through the main action. Our top story this morning is that Labor is launching another initiative to ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australians by proposing to outlaw the charges we rack up when paying for things with debit cards. They will also instruct the consumer watchdog to investigate excessive card costs, as the transaction charges get set for an overhaul. The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, says in an exclusive interview with us today that he would rather see a minority Liberal National party government in power after the 26 October state election than horse-trade with independents and minor parties to share government. Miles faces a stiff task to overcome a big deficit in the polls to stay in power against the challenge from David Crisafulli\u2019s LNP. Calls are mounting for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate business practices in the live music industry after an ABC Four Corners report scrutinising the Australian arm of the live entertainment behemoth Live Nation. Tasmania\u2019s minority Liberal government will need to find a new deputy premier and treasurer after the state\u2019s second-in-charge resigned amid a Bass Strait ferry fiasco. Michael Ferguson quit cabinet last night after being confronted with the prospect of losing a no-confidence vote in parliament today. More coming up.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hard to think of a more politically tone-deaf decision than Anthony Albanese\u2019s purchase of a $4.3m clifftop mansion six months before a cost-of-living election. The government has been drifting in the polls and struggling to get cut-through on its economic measures, lacking a strong narrative about its reason for being in office. While it appears paralysed on economic policy as it awaits an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia, the government \u2013 and particularly Albanese \u2013 have become increasingly vulnerable to the opposition charge of being out of touch with ordinary voters. Meanwhile, the Greens are successfully hammering the government on housing affordability and the rental crisis under the \u201cproperty investor\u201d PM. On the backfoot on measures that would address the housing crisis, Albanese was also forced to clarify the government\u2019s position on negative gearing and capital gains tax reforms in a messy policy debate last month. Polls are tight, and a minority government is on the cards at the next election. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Against this backdrop, colleagues are right to feel dismayed and befuddled by Albanese\u2019s decision to splurge on a lavish Central Coast home with his wife-to-be Jodie Haydon. The move comes as polling shows almost 80% of Australians view home ownership as unattainable for young people without family assistance, inflation remains stubbornly high, and financial stress among working Australians is at record levels. Albanese insisted on Tuesday that he \u201cknows what it\u2019s like to struggle\u201d, but the prime minister\u2019s log cabin story is from a long time ago now. Having been in parliament for almost 30 years, and now on an income of $550,000, the \u201cbattler from Marrickville\u201d trope rings hollow when you\u2019re having to defend the timber-lined cathedral ceilings of your third property at Copacabana (of all places). The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, himself a property investor with undisclosed wealth held in trusts, said little about the purchase, indicating the decision was a \u201cmatter for the prime minister\u201d. But he doesn\u2019t need to. In a political environment where most people are not paying attention to policy or the government\u2019s daily grind, there is nothing like a real estate story \u2013 with pictures to boot \u2013 to get cut-through. It\u2019s just not the kind of cut-through the government needed. Before the last election, Albanese said he had \u201cpicked a side\u201d, choosing to go into bat for working Australians. While no one doubts the prime minister\u2019s battler pedigree, his property investment decision raises a fundamental question: has he not been listening? The judgment is appalling, the optics truly terrible. Unlike those at Kirribilli House, the second prime ministerial residence in Sydney with harbourside views. Couldn\u2019t he have just enjoyed those for another six months and then gone property shopping?",

In England, Pete Sturgess, the former England men\u2019s futsal coach, asked on X recently: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a national association willing to invest in this incredible game? This can\u2019t be right.\u201d An FA spokesperson declined to say whether it would step in to cover the shortfall should the men\u2019s team fail to reach the \u00a395,000 target, adding that since 2022 the FA had provided \u201csupport for England Futsal to run CPD for coaches and referees and a mentoring programme\u201d. It said: \u201cThe launch of England Futsal has also seen the U19s men\u2019s team compete in the Uefa Euros 2022, and FA approval and endorsement for them to enter the senior England teams in Uefa and Fifa competitions, based on the programme being funded and delivered by England Futsal. We look forward to continuing to work with England Futsal.\u201d",

Tucci has already written three bestselling food books, and my feeling at this point is that he has little left to say \u2013 at least on this subject. How many times must we hear how much he loves marinara sauce? Or artichokes? Or aubergine? There are only so many ways to say something is delicious. A lot of space is devoted in this volume to the food in the lounges of airports and the (I assume) business class cabins of planes, and while these passages are very boring indeed, even they\u2019re not so yawn-inducing as the bits about security checks and delayed flights (personally, I would only be inclined to read a five-and-a-half page account of a round trip by air to Aspen if it were by a bona fide genius such as Craig Brown or Geoff Dyer \u2013 and I\u2019d still pour a drink first). Tucci has designed a range of cookware, which is fine by me, even if I\u2019m not in the market for a celebrity colander.

In June, he has dinner at the River Cafe in London with Colin Firth and Tom Ford. \u201cWhat we talked about is none of your business,\u201d he writes, which strikes me as a somewhat bracing approach to reader relations. If you\u2019re unwilling to invade anyone\u2019s privacy, why bother to publish a diary at all? Naturally, I think I know the answer to this question (and so do you, too, probably).

How many times must we hear how much he loves marinara sauce? Or artichokes? Or aubergine? There are only so many ways to say something is delicious. A lot of space is devoted in this volume to the food in the lounges of airports and the (I assume) business class cabins of planes, and while these passages are very boring indeed, even they\u2019re not so yawn-inducing as the bits about security checks and delayed flights (personally, I would only be inclined to read a five-and-a-half page account of a round trip by air to Aspen if it were by a bona fide genius such as Craig Brown or Geoff Dyer \u2013 and I\u2019d still pour a drink first). Tucci has designed a range of cookware, which is fine by me, even if I\u2019m not in the market for a celebrity colander. But when he writes about it here, it seems shabby, whatever his intentions. Occasionally, there are mentions of famous friends such as Jamie Dornan, Saoirse Ronan and Harry Styles (who likes the poet Rilke, apparently), all of whom come for dinner; Tucci and his brother-in-law, the actor John Krasinski, have an away day at Guy Ritchie\u2019s country house, and it\u2019s like something out of Ritchie\u2019s (dire) Netflix series, The Gentlemen. But he\u2019s ever clam-like about other people. In June, he has dinner at the River Cafe in London with Colin Firth and Tom Ford. \u201cWhat we talked about is none of your business,\u201d he writes, which strikes me as a somewhat bracing approach to reader relations. If you\u2019re unwilling to invade anyone\u2019s privacy, why bother to publish a diary at all? Naturally, I think I know the answer to this question (and so do you, too, probably). But as someone who has written for her entire living for more than two decades, I must squeeze a little lemon here. The impulses involved in this book on all sides feel depressingly cynical to me, for it\u2019s thinner than freshly rolled fettuccine. \u2022 What I Ate in One Year by Stanley Tucci is published by Fig Tree (\u00a320).

Having done Georgian England and hip 21st-century England, we\u2019re back in the middle ages here. There\u2019s a 13th-century bridge and a Saxon church in one direction and a medieval tithe barn in the other. Timbrell\u2019s Yard inn is not so old: the Grade-II listed former dye mill dates from the 18th century, and was saved from demolition in 2015. The refurbished interior offers panelling in mellow unfinished wood, low beams, deep window seats and wonky floors aplenty.</p>    <p>Our \u201cRiverwalk\u201d room has bed and bathroom on a mezzanine above a seating area overlooking the river. It\u2019s a gorgeous place to kick back while we wait for the rain to stop and allow us to hike out of town on the winding towpath. At dinner, portions are more modern in volume: we share small plates of heritage tomatoes with tapenade, and tangy ceviche, before manageable mains of chicken parmesan and Asian spiced pork belly. The house merlot is particularly smooth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We share small plates of heritage tomatoes with tapenade, and tangy ceviche, before manageable mains of chicken parmesan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If we\u2019d been touring by car, we\u2019d probably have dashed off from Frome to do Longleat or Stourhead, or visited Iford Manor \u2018s gardens or Farleigh Castle from Bradford-on-Avon.

From the 17th century, this town attracted and kept skilled weavers by offering them bespoke accommodation. Pretty three-storey stone cottages with large upper windows \u2013 offering lots of light for loom work \u2013 climb the hill in rows behind St Laurence church. Their flowery front gardens lie across a path from their doors and all have wide-ranging views.

Elsewhere on the trip, we\u2019d had to use some imagination to picture the England of centuries past, but there\u2019s no need in Lacock, which has been on our screens in Pride and Prejudice, Wolf Hall and Downton Abbey to name but a few.</p> <p>The whole village belongs to the National Trust and has been kept looking like a film set. Buildings on a simple square of streets house tasteful tourism businesses \u2013 garden stuff, gifts, jewellery \u2013 with no garish modern signs to shock a Bennet daughter out on a walk from Longbourn. Eight-hundred-year-old Lacock Abbey (adult, \u00a322) lies just to the west, with a big NT car and coach park: that closes at 5pm, after which the streets magically quieten.

Timbrell\u2019s Yard inn is not so old: the Grade-II listed former dye mill dates from the 18th century, and was saved from demolition in 2015. The refurbished interior offers panelling in mellow unfinished wood, low beams, deep window seats and wonky floors aplenty. Our \u201cRiverwalk\u201d room has bed and bathroom on a mezzanine above a seating area overlooking the river. It\u2019s a gorgeous place to kick back while we wait for the rain to stop and allow us to hike out of town on the winding towpath. At dinner, portions are more modern in volume: we share small plates of heritage tomatoes with tapenade, and tangy ceviche, before manageable mains of chicken parmesan and Asian spiced pork belly. The house merlot is particularly smooth. If we\u2019d been touring by car, we\u2019d probably have dashed off from Frome to do Longleat or Stourhead, or visited Iford Manor \u2018s gardens or Farleigh Castle from Bradford-on-Avon. With only trains and legs, we find quieter, more local attractions: a contemporary art gallery by Frome station and, in Bradford on Avon, the astonishing Weavers\u2019 Cottages. Like in Frome, Bradford-on-Avon\u2019s wealth was built on wool, which before the Industrial Revolution was literally a cottage industry. From the 17th century, this town attracted and kept skilled weavers by offering them bespoke accommodation. Pretty three-storey stone cottages with large upper windows \u2013 offering lots of light for loom work \u2013 climb the hill in rows behind St Laurence church. Their flowery front gardens lie across a path from their doors and all have wide-ranging views. One or two are now holiday lets, but they\u2019re a fascinating picture of long-ago working lives. We add a bus to the mix for our last stop, taking trains to Chippenham via Bath, then the X34 to Lacock. Elsewhere on the trip, we\u2019d had to use some imagination to picture the England of centuries past, but there\u2019s no need in Lacock, which has been on our screens in Pride and Prejudice, Wolf Hall and Downton Abbey to name but a few. The whole village belongs to the National Trust and has been kept looking like a film set. Buildings on a simple square of streets house tasteful tourism businesses \u2013 garden stuff, gifts, jewellery \u2013 with no garish modern signs to shock a Bennet daughter out on a walk from Longbourn. Eight-hundred-year-old Lacock Abbey (adult, \u00a322) lies just to the west, with a big NT car and coach park: that closes at 5pm, after which the streets magically quieten. We wander back to the Sign of the Angel, which would have been a historical building even in Austen\u2019s time, having been built for a wool merchant in 1480. Stone arches lead to the bar and dining room, and stairs climb to bedrooms with heavy latched doors and a panelled guest lounge. It serves Sunday lunch until 6pm so we have just time for excellent plates of roast pork and Brixham plaice with \u201cposh mushy peas\u201d. We share the bus next morning with a pensioner off to a hospital appointment and younger people heading for jobs in Chippenham. Being car-free has opened a window on to West Country life \u2013 only those wheelie bags mark us out as visitors. The trip was provided by Sawday\u2019s, which has a seven-day south-west tour with Byway including stays at the Roseate Villa in Bath, Bistro Lotte in Frome, Timbrell\u2019s Yard in Bradford on Avon and the Sign of the Angel in Lacock, from \u00a3859 (shorter breaks available from \u00a3300) \u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2024.

You have no memory of the former conversation and the latter only happened because you\u2019d rung to query the offer.</p> <p>I asked the RAC how many former customers received this misleading email and whether a subsequent clarification was sent. It ducked both questions and stated merely: \u201cWe\u2019d like to apologise to SM for the error in his email. The email should have explained that rather than being a breakdown policy, this is a free membership that provides a legal advice helpline, discounts from trusted partners, and access to our roadside assistance on a discounted pay-on-use basis.</p> <p>\u201cAny customer taking this membership-only product always has it clearly explained on the phone and will receive a more detailed email than SM did.\u201d</p> <p>I think it highly unlikely you were the only one to receive that deficient wording.

The email was unequivocal. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking to help our members,\u201d it began. \u201cAnd with costs going up, it\u2019s been a tough time for everyone. So we\u2019d like to give you an extra year\u2019s membership \u2013 completely free!\u201d The small print stated that breakdown is provided by RAC Motoring Services. Anyone would assume they were fully covered and it\u2019s not surprising you thought this seemed too good to be true. Extraordinarily, the RAC seems to blame you. It told me that it had explained the invisible caveat to you on the phone when you cancelled your policy last year, and on a call this year. You have no memory of the former conversation and the latter only happened because you\u2019d rung to query the offer. I asked the RAC how many former customers received this misleading email and whether a subsequent clarification was sent. It ducked both questions and stated merely: \u201cWe\u2019d like to apologise to SM for the error in his email. The email should have explained that rather than being a breakdown policy, this is a free membership that provides a legal advice helpline, discounts from trusted partners, and access to our roadside assistance on a discounted pay-on-use basis. \u201cAny customer taking this membership-only product always has it clearly explained on the phone and will receive a more detailed email than SM did.\u201d I think it highly unlikely you were the only one to receive that deficient wording. It\u2019s possible that others signed up under the misapprehension they were covered for breakdown. I suggest you complain to the Advertising Standards Authority. Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, and a warm welcome back to myself: thanks to Nimo and Heather Stewart for bringing you First Edition while I was away.</p> <p>The dread words were repeated in a number of news stories yesterday: \u201cThe summit was livestreamed on LinkedIn.\u201d The event in question was Labour\u2019s inaugural UK business summit, designed to encourage investment in the UK from international firms, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/14/rachel-reeves-hints-rise-in-employer-national-insurance-budget\">mainly getting headlines</a> for chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 hint that she is planning to raise employer national insurance contributions at the budget.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/14/elton-john-michelin-meals-labour-pulls-out-stops-woo-investors\">The bit with Elton John and the king</a> was not streamed, alas. But even if the prospect of tuning in to leadership seminars on the worst person you know\u2019s favourite social network did not entice you, there are plenty of reasons to be interested in how it went. After a long period of governmental chaos and instability under the Conservatives, many companies have found more attractive options elsewhere. And <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/media-office/revealed-investment-in-uk-is-lowest-in-g7-for-third-year-in-a-row-new-data-shows\">according to recent IPPR analysis</a>, the UK has had the lowest rate of business investment of any G7 economy for 24 of the last 30 years.</p> <p>That is why Labour is making the case that greater investment should not be seen as an inherently rightwing ambition. But there are plenty of critics on the left who worry that the \u00a363bn announced yesterday will come at a cost to working people. Today\u2019s newsletter, with the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent <em><strong>Richard Partington</strong></em>, is about what the summit achieved \u2013 and where Labour still has more to do. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Middle East</strong></em> | More than 20 people were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/israeli-airstrike-kills-christian-town-northern-lebanon-gaza\">killed in an Israeli airstrike</a> on a Christian town in northern Lebanon, prompting Hezbollah to fire rockets at Tel Aviv, as Israel\u2019s multifront war continues to escalate.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, and a warm welcome back to myself: thanks to Nimo and Heather Stewart for bringing you First Edition while I was away. The dread words were repeated in a number of news stories yesterday: \u201cThe summit was livestreamed on LinkedIn.\u201d The event in question was Labour\u2019s inaugural UK business summit, designed to encourage investment in the UK from international firms, but mainly getting headlines for chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 hint that she is planning to raise employer national insurance contributions at the budget. The bit with Elton John and the king was not streamed, alas. But even if the prospect of tuning in to leadership seminars on the worst person you know\u2019s favourite social network did not entice you, there are plenty of reasons to be interested in how it went. After a long period of governmental chaos and instability under the Conservatives, many companies have found more attractive options elsewhere. And according to recent IPPR analysis, the UK has had the lowest rate of business investment of any G7 economy for 24 of the last 30 years. That is why Labour is making the case that greater investment should not be seen as an inherently rightwing ambition. But there are plenty of critics on the left who worry that the \u00a363bn announced yesterday will come at a cost to working people. Today\u2019s newsletter, with the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent Richard Partington, is about what the summit achieved \u2013 and where Labour still has more to do. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Middle East | More than 20 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Christian town in northern Lebanon, prompting Hezbollah to fire rockets at Tel Aviv, as Israel\u2019s multifront war continues to escalate. Meanwhile on Monday, the UK, Italy France and Germany released a joint statement condemning Israel for repeatedly attacking UN peacekeepers. Russia | The UK government believes that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, personally authorised the Salisbury novichok poisonings, which could have killed thousands of people, an inquiry has been told. UK news | The father of the 10-year-old schoolgirl Sara Sharif killed her before fleeing to Pakistan and calling police to say he \u201cbeat her up too much\u201d, a court has heard. Sara\u2019s body was discovered at the family home in Woking, Surrey, on 10 August last year alongside a handwritten note from her father. Politics | The Tory leadership candidate Kemi Badenoch has been criticised for a campaign pamphlet that said autistic people received \u201cbetter treatment\u201d and \u201ceconomic privileges and protections\u201d. Conkers | The World Conker Championships is investigating cheating allegations after the men\u2019s winner was found to have a steel chestnut in his pocket. David Jakins, who has competed since 1977 and is also head judge or \u201cKing Conker\u201d, was found to have a metal replica in his pocket when he was searched after his victory. In depth: \u2018Businesses feel they\u2019ve been treated poorly, and can buy into Starmer\u2019s project\u2019 The buildup to the summit hasn\u2019t been easy for Labour: there have been reports of disorganised preparations, and some chief executives thought to have been considering staying away. But on the phone from Guildhall in London yesterday, Richard Partington described a mood of cautious optimism. \u201cThere are just a lot of senior people here, CEOs of huge numbers of international companies \u2013 more than you might have expected,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThey are ready to listen to what the new government has to say.\u201d There were plenty of morale-boosting announcements of new deals, from \u00a36.3bn in UK datacentres to a \u00a31.1bn plan to expand Stansted airport. In the same way that most diplomatic summits amount to signing ceremonies on deals that have been under way for months, not much of this was really the result of the summit itself \u2013 but, said Richard, \u201cthere are some live conversations happening as well as the choreographed stuff \u2013 the chair of GB Energy is here and meeting with people about offshore wind and solar\u201d. Meanwhile, the Stansted deal is also a marker of how ambivalent many progressive observers will be about the ambitions behind the summit, with climate campaigners pointing out aviation\u2019s outsize contribution to carbon emissions. The row over P&amp;O Ferries\u2019 owner DP World, the announcement of \u00a320bn from Australian investment bank Macquarie, which has been criticised for its role in the privatisation of the water industry, and protesters outside opposing the Sizewell C nuclear plant were other signs that the mood music is not quite as cheerful as Starmer might have hoped. Here are some of the key factors working in the government\u2019s favour on investment \u2013 and some of the reasons businesses may still be wary. *** What\u2019s working for Labour Political stability. In his speech to the summit, Starmer sought to emphasise the value of his thumping majority after years of instability under the conservatives. He called it a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to \u201cend \u2026 the sticking-plaster politics that makes it so hard for investors to assess the value of any proposition\u201d. And he promised that the government would have \u201ca mission-led mindset that thinks in years, not the days or hours of the news grid\u201d. \u201cVoices of senior business figures and the data on business investment in the UK in recent years bear that out,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThey hate political uncertainty. Businesses do feel that they\u2019ve been treated poorly, and they can buy into Starmer\u2019s promise of a five or 10-year project.\u201d Promises on regulation. Pledges to reduce red tape are so often repeated by politicians that they can come to sound a bit hollow. Still, Starmer repeated them yesterday, saying that he would \u201crip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment\u201d. And while many will be worried that this might be code for reducing worker and consumer protections, it is certainly a popular argument with industry leaders. \u201cThe biggest thing here is about planning reform,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThere is a bit less detail on what else might be on the agenda in the long term. But Starmer was also talking about broader changes that aren\u2019t so immediate but will be a priority over time, like having a regulatory innovation office that talks to businesses about their issues.\u201d \u201cBut there is a tension here,\u201d Richard added. \u201cLabour is trying to ride two horses \u2013 to say it will bulldoze regulation to help business, but also that it will prioritise workers.\u201d One piece of evidence for that difficulty yesterday: the crowd of journalists following Louise Haigh, the minister whose criticisms of P&amp;O over its sacking of 800 workers without notice were roundly disowned by No 10. Government partnership. Through the creation of both GB Energy and a \u00a37bn national wealth fund, Labour hopes to create a virtuous circle: using public money to leverage additional private sector investment, and then reaping the benefits for taxpayers. \u201cThey are keen to make the case that this is going to drive investment outside London and the south-east,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIt was notable that they went to Merseyside a couple of weeks ago to announce \u00a322bn for carbon capture storage projects.\u201d *** What\u2019s not Timing. The sequencing of this summit and Labour\u2019s first budget, which is due in two weeks\u2019 time, is thought by many business leaders to be the wrong way round, Richard said. \u201cPeople say that by doing it in this order, investors don\u2019t know what the tax and spending policies of the new government will be. They want more answers on mooted changes to capital gains tax and the treatment of private equity profits before they make decisions.\u201d Reeves\u2019 hints over employer national insurance contributions didn\u2019t really provide a lot of clarity either. Protection for workers\u2019 rights. If businesses are enthused by the idea of a bonfire of regulation, they have a more mixed view of Labour\u2019s recent employment rights bill. \u201cStarmer addressed that in his conversation with [former Google CEO] Eric Schmidt,\u201d said Richard. \u201cHe argued that these reforms are ultimately pro-growth, because a better paid, better protected workforce is more productive and efficient.\u201d What businesses think about this \u201cdepends on who you speak to\u201d, he added. \u201cSome highly skilled sectors have these kinds of protections already, but there is a big issue in hospitality and care, where pay is low and there\u2019s been a rise in zero hours employment.\u201d How Starmer resolves the tension between the claims made in these sectors and rights for ordinary working people may prove to be a signpost for the direction of his premiership. Migration. Eric Schmidt told Starmer that \u201ca pro-growth agenda would start with high-skilled immigration\u201d. But in an industrial strategy consultation document published yesterday, migration was barely mentioned at all \u2013 and shortly after the election, Starmer said that \u201cwe won\u2019t be content just to pull the easy lever of importing skills\u201d, suggesting that it would actually be possible to reduce this kind of migration, not increase it. He declined to give a timetable on those proposals. But the toxic tone of political discourse on migration will not be encouraging to those who think that the UK needs more of it to thrive \u2013 and Schmidt\u2019s remarks could certainly be interpreted as a warning. Brexit. The elephant in the room, and barely mentioned in Starmer\u2019s speech, the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union has left it at a competitive disadvantage, many business leaders believe. A research paper for the Economics Observatory thinktank last year concluded that UK business investment had been \u201csubdued\u201d by Brexit, with a shortfall of about 10% against where it might otherwise have stood in 2022. And the Bank of England found that investment was 23% lower than it would otherwise have been in 2020/21. \u201cThere is no doubt Labour is in a better position to change its relationship with the EU than the Conservatives were,\u201d Richard said. \u201cBut so far, they have only said very top level things about a closer relationship. Businesses are happy to hear that, but there is a reluctance from the government to entertain the idea of rejoining the common market, or for talks on closer regulatory alignment. Businesses are still waiting to see the substance.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading When Shaun Walker first met Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez (above) on a training course for journalists heading to war zones, he couldn\u2019t have imagined that he would eventually be accused of spying for Russia \u2013 and welcomed to Moscow by Vladimir Putin. Shaun\u2019s investigation of who Gonz\u00e1lez really was makes for a classic long long read. Archie Tessa West challenges the idea that to be fulfilled in your work life, you have to be passionate and love your career. \u201cLet\u2019s try to have a healthy amount of psychological distance from work,\u201d she writes in The big idea essay. \u201cRelish parts of your job, but don\u2019t expect to feel passionate about the whole thing.\u201d Nimo After Kemi Badenoch\u2019s leaflet claimed that kids with autism receive \u201cbetter treatment\u201d and \u201ceconomic privileges\u201d, John Harris writes that for children like his son, the idea of \u201can expanded state delivering indulgence and mollycoddling \u2026 is a cruel fantasy\u201d. Archie A school in Cambridgeshire was heavily criticised for introducing a policy that meant any time off school for period pains would be categorised as an unauthorised absence if parents did not provide a doctor\u2019s note. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett brilliantly explains what this policy reveals about the minimisation of female pain and how early in life it starts.

Oliver Milman reports Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad Carol Douglas (pictured above) quit art school when she was 16 after her parents discouraged her from pursuing an arts-based career. Decades later, when she was working with children on their school arts projects, she realised how much she missed having a creative outlet. So when she retired, at 62, Douglas decided to make her own art. Douglas enrolled in a York College art foundation course and soon found her style. After completing the course, she started experimenting with cheap acrylic paint and secondhand canvases bought at car boot sales and soon her art was being shown in small exhibitions and cafes. Now Douglas has opened her biggest exhibition to date, Actually I Can, at Yorkshire Sculpture Park, which features 51 of her paintings. \u201cThe first time I saw the paintings in the gallery it was mind-boggling. Seeing your work in a really professional and beautiful space is quite something. I am unbelievably proud,\u201d she says.

The student, who cannot be named for legal reasons, made the complaint to the state\u2019s Human Rights Commissioner, arguing she suffered discrimination by the new uniform policy which requires female students between years 7 and 12 to wear a skirt on formal occasions including outings, ceremonies, events and photographs. Females are allowed to wear shorts and pants on other days, while male students wear them every day. The father of the student argued in the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal that his daughter suffered a greater financial burden because she had to buy two school uniforms and that greater care was needed to maintain her modesty in a skirt compared with male students.

      "bodyText": "George Negus, who became a household name for his reporting on Nine\u2019s groundbreaking 60 Minutes program in the 1970s and 1980s, has died aged 82. His family said in a statement that the TV and radio presenter and author had died after a battle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Negus specialised in international affairs and was the founding presenter on the ABC\u2019s Foreign Correspondent and SBS\u2019s Dateline. His direct style was exemplified by a 60 Minutes interview with the then UK prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, in 1981 which became the stuff of legend. Negus: \u201cWhy are people in the street telling us that Margaret Thatcher isn\u2019t just inflexible, not just single-minded, sometimes just plain pigheaded and won\u2019t be told by anybody?\u201d Thatcher: \u201cWho precisely is stopping you in the street, George? Give me their names.\u201d Kerry O\u2019Brien, a close friend and a former colleague of Negus on This Day Tonight, said he was an \u201cextraordinary, generous human being\u201d. \u201cI think one of George\u2019s great strengths for television was that the person you saw in the frame was an exact replica of the man,\u201d O\u2019Brien told Guardian Australia. \u201cSo many people on television seem to present a slightly different persona, or the kind of essence of the person is not necessarily captured. But George was George, wherever he was, whatever he stood on, whatever desk he sat behind \u2013 and it was the same George that you\u2019d be having a beer with, or a good meal and sucking on a good red. He was the same guy when he was home with Kirsty and the kids.\u201d Negus rose to fame on the ABC\u2019s pioneering 1960s current affairs program This Day Tonight. He fronted many shows during his long career including George Negus Tonight and Australia Talks on the ABC, Nine\u2019s Today and several news programs on the Ten Network. His family said Negus \u201cpassed away peacefully surrounded by loved ones\u201d and thanked Australian healthcare workers for supporting him \u201cin the best possible way\u201d during his final moments. \u201cDespite the challenges diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s inflict on families, we still shared beautiful times, laughter and happiness together in recent times,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe also learnt a lot.\u201d Last month one of his sons, Ned, said his father was in an aged care facility and was mostly \u201cnon-verbal\u201d. \u201cFor those of you who don\u2019t know, my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s around five years ago,\u201d Ned wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s now non verbal most of the time (mind-blowing for me but also any of you that know him).\u201d Negus was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2015 and was honoured for his significant service to the media as a journalist and television presenter, and to conservation and the environment. In 2021 he was awarded a Walkley Award for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism, when it was noted there were few journalists in Australia as recognisable as George Negus. \u201cKnown for his charisma, his peerless and fearless approach, and his signature moustache, he has reported through decades of technological, political and social change,\u201d the Walkleys judges said. Negus trained as a high school teacher and worked at Indooroopilly state high school in Queensland before getting his first reporting job at 28. A longtime resident of Bellingen, Negus is survived by his partner, the journalist and collaborator Kirsty Cockburn, and their sons Serge and Ned. \u201cWhile we know he will be celebrated for his unique contribution to journalism, football, and the environment, he would also want to be remembered for the incredible family man he was,\u201d his family\u2019s statement read. ABC managing director David Anderson said he learned of the death of George Negus with great sadness, adding that audiences saw him as a giant of Australian television and journalism. \u201cAmong his many career achievements are his contributions to the ABC as a reporter for This Day Tonight in the 1960s and 1970s and as the founding host of Foreign Correspondent in the 1990s,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAustralian audiences loved not only his natural charm but also his intellectual curiosity for the world around him. \u201cOn behalf of everyone at the ABC, I extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends.\u201d",

It was this friendship, suggested one alleged Bishnoi gang affiliate in a Facebook post after the killing, that resulted in the politician\u2019s assassination, linked to a feud going back to the 90s. \u201cSalman Khan, we did not want this war but you made our brother lose his life,\u201d said the post.</p>    <p>Yet Mumbai\u2019s police and the Maharashtra chief minister, Eknath Shinde, pledged that the killing would not mark a return to a time when Bollywood stars were often a prime target for criminal extortion and violence. \u201cBe it the Bishnoi gang or any underworld gang, we won\u2019t spare anyone,\u201d said Shinde.</p> <p>By Monday night, several of the alleged shooters and alleged conspirators had been arrested by police but other key suspects remained on the run. Those arrested allegedly told police that Siddique\u2019s son had also been on a list of targets, according to reports.</p> <h2>The spark for the fuse</h2> <p>From the 1970s to the late 1990s, the closure of Mumbai\u2019s textile mills led thousands of unemployed men to join criminal gangs. Violent criminal overlords \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/03/indian-fugitives-pakistan-dawood-ibrahim\">Dawood Ibrahim the most famous among them</a> \u2013 began to run the city, terrorising residents and extorting everyone from Bollywood stars to big business executives.</p> <p>The campaign of violence was ultimately brought under control in the late 1990s, but not before a series of bomb blasts left hundreds dead and after an all-out bloody war between gangs and police saw politicians, film directors and gang leaders among those shot in broad daylight.</p>    <p>In the years since, the hold of the gangs weakened and Mumbai shed its reputation for criminality to become known as one of India\u2019s safest cities. However, it was earlier this year that the Bishnoi gang \u2013 which previously operated mostly in north India \u2013 first made its presence known in the south Indian metropolis.</p> <p>It is an extraordinary long-running feud that appears to have brought Bishnoi\u2019s gang to Mumbai, relating to one of Bollywood\u2019s biggest stars, Salman Khan and a case dating back to 1998 where Khan was implicated in the hunting and killing of two blackbuck antelope. Twenty years later, the Bollywood star was convicted in the case and give a suspended five-year jail term.</p> <p>According to Bishnoi\u2019s community in Punjab, blackbucks are considered sacred reincarnations of their spiritual leader and the mob boss had appeared to take Khan\u2019s shooting of them personally. Bishnoi vowed to take revenge on the Bollywood star, openly stating at a court appearance in 2018: \u201cWe will kill Salman Khan\u201d.</p> <p>The feud escalated further earlier this year when a member of Bishnoi\u2019s gang fired shots outside Khan\u2019s Mumbai residence. The Mumbai police said they had foiled two other assassination attempts on Khan and pledged to wipe out Bishnoi\u2019s gang from the city entirely.</p> <p>Yet Saturday\u2019s high-profile assassination, reportedly planned carefully for months, appeared to indicate that the Bishnoi gang has instead infiltrated Mumbai even further.</p>",

The killing has led to fears that Bishnoi is attempting to fill a vacuum left by Mumbai\u2019s most notorious gang leaders who mostly fled, were killed or jailed. \u201cThis horrifying incident exposes the complete collapse of law and order in Maharashtra,\u201d said Rahul Gandhi, a leader in the opposition Congress party. To many in India\u2019s thriving film and financial capital, the brazen killing was a chilling reminder of Mumbai\u2019s dark criminal past and stirred up fears of a return of the gang violence and organised crime that reigned in the city for decades. Siddique, 66, was not only a well-known political face in Mumbai but was also known for his close relationships with Bollywood stars, with Salman Khan chief among them. It was this friendship, suggested one alleged Bishnoi gang affiliate in a Facebook post after the killing, that resulted in the politician\u2019s assassination, linked to a feud going back to the 90s. \u201cSalman Khan, we did not want this war but you made our brother lose his life,\u201d said the post. Yet Mumbai\u2019s police and the Maharashtra chief minister, Eknath Shinde, pledged that the killing would not mark a return to a time when Bollywood stars were often a prime target for criminal extortion and violence. \u201cBe it the Bishnoi gang or any underworld gang, we won\u2019t spare anyone,\u201d said Shinde. By Monday night, several of the alleged shooters and alleged conspirators had been arrested by police but other key suspects remained on the run. Those arrested allegedly told police that Siddique\u2019s son had also been on a list of targets, according to reports. The spark for the fuse From the 1970s to the late 1990s, the closure of Mumbai\u2019s textile mills led thousands of unemployed men to join criminal gangs. Violent criminal overlords \u2013 Dawood Ibrahim the most famous among them \u2013 began to run the city, terrorising residents and extorting everyone from Bollywood stars to big business executives. The campaign of violence was ultimately brought under control in the late 1990s, but not before a series of bomb blasts left hundreds dead and after an all-out bloody war between gangs and police saw politicians, film directors and gang leaders among those shot in broad daylight. In the years since, the hold of the gangs weakened and Mumbai shed its reputation for criminality to become known as one of India\u2019s safest cities. However, it was earlier this year that the Bishnoi gang \u2013 which previously operated mostly in north India \u2013 first made its presence known in the south Indian metropolis. It is an extraordinary long-running feud that appears to have brought Bishnoi\u2019s gang to Mumbai, relating to one of Bollywood\u2019s biggest stars, Salman Khan and a case dating back to 1998 where Khan was implicated in the hunting and killing of two blackbuck antelope. Twenty years later, the Bollywood star was convicted in the case and give a suspended five-year jail term. According to Bishnoi\u2019s community in Punjab, blackbucks are considered sacred reincarnations of their spiritual leader and the mob boss had appeared to take Khan\u2019s shooting of them personally. Bishnoi vowed to take revenge on the Bollywood star, openly stating at a court appearance in 2018: \u201cWe will kill Salman Khan\u201d. The feud escalated further earlier this year when a member of Bishnoi\u2019s gang fired shots outside Khan\u2019s Mumbai residence. The Mumbai police said they had foiled two other assassination attempts on Khan and pledged to wipe out Bishnoi\u2019s gang from the city entirely. Yet Saturday\u2019s high-profile assassination, reportedly planned carefully for months, appeared to indicate that the Bishnoi gang has instead infiltrated Mumbai even further.",

The high-speed line from central London (ish) to the north of England, has for a decade been rightly derided as an outrageously expensive endeavour that has already failed in its most basic aim of levelling up England. But while the betrayal of the north of England over HS2 has been well documented, chances are you don\u2019t know this: Wales has been betrayed just as much as the disappointed regions of England, if not more.</p> <p>I don\u2019t blame you for not being aware of the Great Welsh Train Robbery. Hidden among thousands of impenetrable Treasury papers, the tale takes some unpicking. But unlike the experience on most UK train journeys, it is worth the wait.</p> <p>In 2015, David Cameron\u2019s government decided to define HS2 as an \u201cEngland and Wales project\u201d. In technical jargon this means they applied a 0% comparability factor for Wales to HS2 spending. That may seem hard to decipher, but what you need to know is this: though it sounds fairly innocuous, designating HS2 an \u201cEngland and Wales project\u201d was utterly devastating to Wales because it meant that Cymru did not receive any consequential funding from the project.</p> <p>Compare this with Scotland and Northern Ireland, which were each treated to a delightful comparability factor of 100%. This meant that for every \u00a31 spent on HS2, they both got a population-based share of all of it. It is hard to put an exact figure on how much this will add up to, because the UK government keeps axing parts of the project and the costs keep rising, but roughly, Scotland will bank in the region of \u00a36.5bn-\u00a37bn. If the same rules were applied to Wales, it would have been on course for about \u00a34bn.</p> <p>The eagle-eyed will have noticed that the HS2 \u201cEngland and Wales project\u201d has the significant flaw that HS2 doesn\u2019t actually go through Wales. In fact, not a centimetre of track is on the western side of Offa\u2019s Dyke. So how can successive UK governments justify defining it as a Welsh project? It depends who you ask, and when you ask them.</p> <p>In 2021, the then under-secretary of state for Wales, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/11/tory-welsh-secretary-broke-ministerial-code-with-social-media-video-says-labour\">David TC Davies</a>, argued that HS2 would benefit Wales because it would get the UK\u2019s \u201ccarbon emissions down\u201d and help people in north Wales get to London quicker. Davies has also argued that Northern Powerhouse Rail, which was also defined as a Welsh project, was right to be classed as such because people in Wales would benefit from it when they \u201c<a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/excuses-deflections-half-truths-lift-27409217\">go to Leeds</a>\u201d. The past decade of excuses and justifications have been so varied and inconsistent that you almost have to respect their audacity.</p> <p>But the Great Welsh Train Robbery goes well beyond HS2. Despite having 5% of the UK population and 11% of track miles, Wales has received <a href=\"https://www.gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2018-12/the-rail-network-in-wales-case-for-investment.pdf\">only 1-2% of rail enhancement funding</a> in recent years. Indeed, Cymru has been stuck in second class for a while. From 2011-12 to 2019-20, the <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/wales-governance-centre/publications/finance\">Wales Governance Centre estimates</a> that Wales received \u00a3514m less than it would have received under a population-based share of the UK\u2019s rail infrastructure spending.</p>    <p>What does that mean for the service? Only <a href=\"https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/media/2014/rail-infrastructure-assets-2020-21.pdf\">3.7% of Wales\u2019 railways are electrified</a>, compared with about 44% in England and 33% in Scotland.<strong> </strong>If you want to travel from Aberystwyth on Wales\u2019s west coast to our nation\u2019s capital in Cardiff, you have to go via England. Meanwhile, getting from Bangor in the north to Carmarthen in the south will take you at least 6\u00bd hours \u2026 via Shrewsbury (so another winding route via a neighbouring country). For context, the train from London to Edinburgh is just 4\u00bd hours.</p> <p>To rub salt into the wound, the <a href=\"https://www.business-live.co.uk/economic-development/how-rails-hs2-project-would-17563747\">Department for Transport\u2019s own figures</a> say that HS2 could cost the south Wales economy \u00a3200m a year because of changes that would reduce capacity on the south Wales part of the network. While England gets high-speed rail, Wales\u2019s economy will suffer as a result.</p> <p>Why does Wales keep getting cheated? It\u2019s simple, really: rail isn\u2019t devolved. It is in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and because of that their budgets automatically receive an increase roughly relative to their population when England spends more on rail. The Welsh government, meanwhile, rejected rail devolution 18 years ago (something it now bitterly regrets).</p> <p>Though Wales receiving extra money for English rail spending is not automatic (automatic spending is known as a Barnett consequential), there is precedent for treating projects that are clearly for England as solely \u201cEnglish\u201d. For example, when the Elizabeth line was built in the Crossrail project, Wales received a consequential in their budget.

      "bodyText": "Name: Landlines. Age: 148 years old. Appearance: A cable attached to your phone that\u2019s tied to your house. I haven\u2019t had a landline for years. Oh, you young whippersnapper! You\u2019re really missing out. On what, exactly? On so much! Telling the caller your full telephone number when answering the phone, being trapped in a room where everyone in your family can clearly hear your side of the conversation. It\u2019s the best. It doesn\u2019t sound like the best. You wouldn\u2019t understand. I still get lots of calls on my landline phone, you know. From whom? Oh, all my new friends. The guy who has promised to give me millions of pounds to thank me for lending him \u00a310,000. The woman from the bank who keeps asking me for all my personal details. They are a lovely lot. I hate to say it, but I think perhaps you\u2019re being scammed. I am almost certainly being scammed, yes. It turns out that more than half of all calls to landlines these days are from scammers. Why? It could be because it\u2019s harder to screen and block scam numbers on a landline phone than a mobile. It could be because people who want to speak to you for a legitimate reason will just ring your mobile. Or it could be because it\u2019s mainly old people who have landlines these days. How is that relevant? Because scammers famously like to target elderly people, and 80% of elderly people have landlines, compared to just 50% of 18-29-year-olds. So if you\u2019re a scammer and you dial a landline \u2026 You are more likely to get a friendly senior who may not realise that you\u2019re trying to empty their bank account. Dreadful. This has to be the death of the landline. Don\u2019t speak too soon, because the landline phone is now coveted by gen Z. Why? Because they\u2019re cool and retro, like cassette players. Listen, if you\u2019re 20 years old, then you\u2019ve lived your whole life using your phone as a laptop, camera, book and food ordering system. Doesn\u2019t it sound refreshing to only be able to use it as a phone? Oh, I see. It\u2019s imagined nostalgia. Maybe it will catch on. After all, nothing gives you the joy of a telephone conversation like an actual telephone. Wait, what do you mean by conversation? You know, talking to somebody. Via text? No, via your mouth. I would actually have to talk to someone? Vocally? Over the phone? That is my biggest fear. Well, you might die of loneliness with that attitude but the good news is you\u2019ll never get scammed. Do say: \u201cLandline users are more susceptible to scams.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cBut just give me all your bank details and I\u2019ll tell the scammers to stop.\u201d",

M&amp;S are offering it on the high street for the first time this year, perhaps as a novelty product, perhaps to test its popularity for years to come \u2013 or both. Mulled white wine has in fact been a thing for some time now, enjoyed at parties as far back as the Roman empire. In Europe they have <em>gl\u00fchwein</em>, which I have enjoyed in Copenhagen, Germany and France. In central Europe it goes by the name <em>kuhano vino</em>, or \u201ccooked wine\u201d, which can be red or white. So, a white mulled wine is by no means anything new, but it\u2019s certainly a curiosity for this year\u2019s festive high street offering.</p> <p>As someone who drinks frequently and broadly, I wasn\u2019t thrown by its novelty factor. Trying to freak me out with a weird wine is like showing a seasoned dominatrix fluffy pink handcuffs. Been there, done that.

The label goes on to say the wine can be warmed by heating gently on the stove or microwaving on high for one minute. I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s savouring a single mug of white mulled wine on their own; I\u2019m in the business of getting a lot of people rather pissed quite quickly, so I would sling it on the stove. It also says to add lemon to \u201cappreciate the subtle aroma\u201d. If that aroma is the lemon you\u2019ve just put in, that would make sense. I\u2019m often wary of products that ask me to add things to adequately \u201cappreciate\u201d them, but this is mulled wine, and what is mulled wine if not a moist potpourri?</p> <p>True, the addition of lemon perks up the preserved citrus notes. I also add cardamom, which feels right for a white wine; I wouldn\u2019t put it in a red. With the addition of cloves, it feels a little more inviting. I give it a sip. Pears, yes. Pear drops, but not in a way that suggests volatile acidity, it\u2019s just very, very sweet on the palate. So sweet that I think this will appeal to most people, even the ones who don\u2019t particularly like wine. Christmas is not a time for critical thinking; a bearded man is coming down the chimney later. Mulled wine, whatever colour it comes in, is a wonderful thing to have thrust into your cold hands at a Christmas market or staff party, hastily guzzled without thinking about it too much.</p> <p>So, lemon, pear and vanilla, which makes three tasting notes, discounting the addition of spices. There\u2019s not much in the way of complexity, but at \u00a36.50, does there need to be? I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s perfectly fit for purpose.

As more of the 100,000 rose, so these all-brown funnels could have been mistaken for something inanimate, like bands of mud, except as they stretched they flickered white with underwings caught in sunlight. Then all climbed and amassed mid\u2011sky as a solid steepling cloud \u2013 a vision outdone only by the boiling thrum of wings. The differential in the speed of light and sound waves meant there was a slight disconnect in its unfolding whole, but the sheer volume of it \u2013 like muttering thunder \u2013 had no equal for vitality in my half-century of natural history. The air itself was alive. Bright autumn light now chiselled the whole into a million brilliant details: three female pintails climbing somehow through a globe of flying waders; a flock of oystercatchers flickering black and white as they sheeted to the water line; and everywhere in atomised sub-flocks, knots, rising and twisting and crashing back upon themselves, then scattering like silvered chaff through the darker seed of godwits spiring outwards. It was music. It was theatre. It was mayhem. It was magic. It was beyond words, beyond price, in fact, beyond any kind of human measure, except to say that it makes all our lives richer merely to know that it is there.

The term was coined by US researchers in a study published in the <a href=\"https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.6472\">Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine</a>, which showed that, ironically, geeking out over your nightly sleep data may actually make your insomnia worse. The scientists observed how some people spent excessive time in bed trying to perfect their score, while others experienced anxiety about not achieving a good enough sleep performance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"245d5abc-f063-496c-ad89-1aede156ffa6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rJ2mkv5GJhc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But what constitutes \u201ca great sleep score\u201d? And is it even possible to hack an involuntary biological process?</p> \n<p>Katie Fischer, a behavioural sleep therapist, says that many of her clients are chasing the \u201cperfect\u201d night\u2019s sleep. \u201cThe thing is, if you ask good sleepers what they do, they will usually say \u2018nothing\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re not thinking about sleep. They\u2019re tired, go to bed and drift off. They wake up feeling refreshed and don\u2019t worry about the occasional bad night because they know that happens sometimes. Meanwhile, people who come to me with problems are often putting pressure on themselves to attain a magic number of sleep hours, typically eight, without understanding that they might not need that much.\u201d</p> \n<p>She has seen clients distraught because their trackers have recorded only 11% deep sleep a night. \u201cI tell them that\u2019s pretty normal. We sleep in cycles of roughly 90 minutes and we transition between light, deep and REM phases. For most people, deep sleep will only account for 13-23% of the night. Time awake is also a normal part of sleep. We can have between three and six rousings a night; often we\u2019re not even aware of them. Most people have no idea what normal sleep looks like, so they panic when they see stats with lots of awakenings and not much deep sleep.\u201d</p> \n<p>Someone who knows first-hand about crunching sleep numbers is Ollie Matthews, a functional medicine practitioner and health coach. He has experimented with most leading device brands including Samsung and Apple Watches. Currently he uses an Oura Gen3 smart ring and cross-references it with his Garmin Connect, which he bought for running but which handily also has a sleep tracker.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe way I\u2019ve used these has changed over the years, mostly because I\u2019ve seen how my own clients can become a bit obsessed with them, as I was myself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt used to be that the first thing I would do when I woke up was check my data, and sync it to my other devices, without actually checking in with my own body. I would panic if my \u2018readiness\u2019 score was low or my sleep score had dipped.\u201d</p> \n<p>On his Garmin tracker there is a \u201cbody battery\u2019\u201d indicator that logs the user\u2019s level of \u201ccharge\u201d, based on their stress level (measured by HRV, which stands for heart rate variability), how much rest they have had, their sleep score and, for some people, body temperature. \u201cI\u2019ve managed not to be as obsessed with it now,\u201d says Matthews. \u201cI used to look at it when I was falling asleep, to track my sleep latency [how quickly you\u2019re getting into sleep state]. And I wouldn\u2019t listen to the helpful messages it was sending me, such as: don\u2019t train at the gym when my sleep scores were low. I suppose the appeal of these is that you can gamify your own health, and your entire life.\u201d</p> \n<p>It may sound overzealous to be cross-referencing two devices, but Matthews says this is purely because since he upgraded to the latest Oura ring, it seems to be picking up on his wife\u2019s movements much more than the previous one. \u201cI\u2019ve resolved it by us sleeping in separate beds \u2013 though, to be fair, she is pregnant, so it\u2019s not just about the sleep tracking.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2007, in San Francisco, the Wired editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly coined the term \u201cquantified self\u201d when describing the concept of \u201cself-knowledge through numbers\u201d. Now, this ever-growing trend for self-scrutiny has spread to the quest for optimal sleep. Against a backdrop of apps, books and podcasts hosted by sleep geeks, the UK industry for sleep trackers <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/horizon/outlook/wearable-sleep-trackers-market/uk\">was estimated at \u00a3270m last year and is forecast to more than double by 2030</a>.</p> \n<p>As someone who once went through a terrible year of insomnia during a stressful life episode, I haven\u2019t dared to use one. It would stress me out to have a nightly critique of my sleep quality. But I am curious. What are these devices actually measuring in order to come up with all this data?</p> \n<p>Dr Neil Stanley, the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-sleep-well-9780857087683/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">How to Sleep Well</a>, has been working in the field of sleep research for 42 years, starting out at the neurosciences division of the RAF. He sighs when I ask him to explain how most devices analyse our shuteye. \u201cThese things can just about measure how much sleep you\u2019ve had, and how long it took you to get there,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the only accurate way of distinguishing between light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep is by observing the brain.\u201d He mentions that while <a href=\"https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/news/are-sleep-trackers-accurate-here2019s-what-researchers-currently-know\">one study</a> showed that sleep trackers are now \u201creasonably accurate\u201d, some of the claims made are questionable.</p> \n<p>But Stanley also wants to raise a more fundamental question. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my career hooking people up to monitors in spaces designed to be the finest bedrooms on the planet. I\u2019ve sat there watching the squiggly lines that measure the different stages of sleep. And, to be honest, it doesn\u2019t mean a thing. Because what even the most accurate data cannot do is influence you to sleep more hours. So, for the general public, what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p> \n<p>He also says that if there is one night when someone misses out on the sleep they need, the body will usually rebound to catch up the night after. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t improve the quality of your sleep; there are lots of things you can do. I would recommend anyone to keep a pen-and-paper sleep diary of what time they go to bed, how tired they feel, when they wake up and how awake they feel at 11am. In other words \u2013 listen to your body, not data.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fischer agrees. \u201cPerfect sleep doesn\u2019t really exist. There\u2019s no foolproof recipe, and micromanaging data only creates stress. What matters is: how do you feel? Do you have enough energy to get through the day and feel as if you\u2019re functioning well with a good quality of life? The best way to keep tabs on it is to look at patterns over a week or two rather than obsessing over one or two individual nights. You want to check that you\u2019re feeling well rested at least four nights a week without having spells of being awake for longer than 30 minutes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Guy Leschziner, the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-secret-world-of-sleep-9781471176388/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Secret World of Sleep</a> and a consultant at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals in London, also questions the usefulness of sleep tracking. \u201cThere are some intrinsic differences between tracking sleep and tracking exercise. If a Fitbit tells you that you\u2019ve only done 2,000 steps, it\u2019s not that difficult to up your count. But being told that you are not sleeping enough hours or deeply enough isn\u2019t actionable,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe magic way of getting a good\u2019s night sleep is to recognise what the obstacles are. Are you sleep deprived because there aren\u2019t enough hours in your day? Or is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep in the first place? Or do you get enough hours but find yourself still feeling sleepy during the day (a possible sign of a sleep disorder)? On the basis of that information, you can seek help.\u201d</p> \n<p>He is of the opinion that any data about REM sleep, associated with dreaming, emotional processing and memory consolidation, is meaningless. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to interpret those numbers. We do know that REM sleep serves an important function, but in the past, when certain antidepressants suppressed REM sleep altogether, people didn\u2019t suffer any consequences.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe other issue is that even the most accurate devices have not been validated in people who suffer from abnormal sleep. So if you suffer from insomnia or sleep apnoea, your device is likely to be less accurate.\u201d The new Apple Watch 10 gives sleep apnoea notifications \u2013 is this not useful? \u201cIn theory, yes. We know that 80% to 90% of people with the sleep breathing disorder don\u2019t know they are suffering from it. But it\u2019s only just been released, so any claims of accuracy would need to be properly evaluated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Leschziner believes there is one group who can definitely benefit from sleep tracking: those who have been burning the candle at both ends and have lost track of how much sleep they are getting \u2013 or losing. Schuggie Macinnes falls into this category. He runs a business as a \u201cceilidh caller\u201d, hosting Scottish events at weddings and clubs across the Midlands. But during quieter times he also works as a payroll manager for a housing association. And he\u2019s a father, who likes to keep fit. \u201cMy sleep patterns are erratic,\u201d he says. \u201cSome nights I might be in bed at 9pm and sleep in until 10am. Other days, I\u2019ll be up at 4.50am to get to the gym, then drive to work. Then if I\u2019ve got a ceilidh, I won\u2019t be home until 2am. My son plays football so I have to get up early the next day. I wear a Whoop band and eventually it gave up on telling me how much sleep debt I had. It was off the scale.\u201d</p> \n<p>Far from getting stressed by the numbers though, Macinnes believes monitoring how much sleep he is getting is really helpful. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to keep track otherwise. So I\u2019ll know when it\u2019s a good idea to try to prioritise more sleep. It\u2019s also helpful to see how what I do in the run up to going to bed \u2013 eating late, having a drink \u2013 impacts the quality of my sleep.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there are some life circumstances where monitoring sleep data is of no use whatsoever. Leila Green, an entrepreneur, was a keen runner who used a Garmin watch to log her times. As it had an inbuilt sleep tracker, she began to make use of that too. \u201cI really liked it. I\u2019d wake up each morning intrigued. How did I do? It was fun.\u201d</p> \n<p>That all changed when Leila gave birth to triplets. \u201cOn a bad night, I wouldn\u2019t get more than four hours, and that would be broken. In the morning, my watch would send me super unhelpful comments like \u2018you may find you are more tired than usual today\u2019. It began to feel like the watch was telling me off. It just wound me up. And I felt like a sleep failure. My other problem with sleep data is it\u2019s something that happened in the past so you can\u2019t do anything about it. I\u2019m desperate for coffee, the kids are screaming; the last thing I needed was a negative review of the night before.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, now that her sons are at nursery, Leila has gone back to wearing her tracker. \u201cIt made sense to start using it again because I wanted to improve my exercise and sleep and get on top of things. And even if I feel like I\u2019ve had a terrible night, sometimes I might look at my score in the morning and it\u2019s giving me 90%. It\u2019s psychosomatic, I guess. My watch has told me I\u2019ve had a great night\u2019s sleep so I can\u2019t really be tired can I? I will get on with my day feeling like I\u2019ve been awarded a gold star.\u201d</p> \n<p>Where will it all end? <a href=\"https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/news/2023/may/technology-changing-sleep-kate-coveney/\">A recent article</a> published by Loughborough University on the future of sleep tech mooted concepts including pyjamas embedded with sensors to track changes to posture, breathing and heart rate, and hugging a robot pillow coded with a respiratory pattern to help people get to the land of nod more quickly.

      "bodyText": "The other day, I was plodding away on the treadmill at the gym when I overheard two blokes chatting. \u201cI had a great night last night,\u201d said one. My ears pricked up. A juicy story? \u201cScored 96.\u201d I yawned. \u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d his companion gasped. \u201cMy average is 67 and I can\u2019t seem to get it much higher.\u201d \u201cAh, but how\u2019s your HRV?\u201d \u201cNever check that, but I know my REM score\u2019s been all over the place this week.\u201d It was only the mention of REM, AKA rapid eye movement, that made me realise they were comparing notes on their sleep performance. Welcome to the world of orthosomnia, the medical term for an unhealthy obsession with attaining perfect sleep, usually driven by a wearable device. The term was coined by US researchers in a study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, which showed that, ironically, geeking out over your nightly sleep data may actually make your insomnia worse. The scientists observed how some people spent excessive time in bed trying to perfect their score, while others experienced anxiety about not achieving a good enough sleep performance. But what constitutes \u201ca great sleep score\u201d? And is it even possible to hack an involuntary biological process? Katie Fischer, a behavioural sleep therapist, says that many of her clients are chasing the \u201cperfect\u201d night\u2019s sleep. \u201cThe thing is, if you ask good sleepers what they do, they will usually say \u2018nothing\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re not thinking about sleep. They\u2019re tired, go to bed and drift off. They wake up feeling refreshed and don\u2019t worry about the occasional bad night because they know that happens sometimes. Meanwhile, people who come to me with problems are often putting pressure on themselves to attain a magic number of sleep hours, typically eight, without understanding that they might not need that much.\u201d She has seen clients distraught because their trackers have recorded only 11% deep sleep a night. \u201cI tell them that\u2019s pretty normal. We sleep in cycles of roughly 90 minutes and we transition between light, deep and REM phases. For most people, deep sleep will only account for 13-23% of the night. Time awake is also a normal part of sleep. We can have between three and six rousings a night; often we\u2019re not even aware of them. Most people have no idea what normal sleep looks like, so they panic when they see stats with lots of awakenings and not much deep sleep.\u201d Someone who knows first-hand about crunching sleep numbers is Ollie Matthews, a functional medicine practitioner and health coach. He has experimented with most leading device brands including Samsung and Apple Watches. Currently he uses an Oura Gen3 smart ring and cross-references it with his Garmin Connect, which he bought for running but which handily also has a sleep tracker. \u201cThe way I\u2019ve used these has changed over the years, mostly because I\u2019ve seen how my own clients can become a bit obsessed with them, as I was myself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt used to be that the first thing I would do when I woke up was check my data, and sync it to my other devices, without actually checking in with my own body. I would panic if my \u2018readiness\u2019 score was low or my sleep score had dipped.\u201d On his Garmin tracker there is a \u201cbody battery\u2019\u201d indicator that logs the user\u2019s level of \u201ccharge\u201d, based on their stress level (measured by HRV, which stands for heart rate variability), how much rest they have had, their sleep score and, for some people, body temperature. \u201cI\u2019ve managed not to be as obsessed with it now,\u201d says Matthews. \u201cI used to look at it when I was falling asleep, to track my sleep latency [how quickly you\u2019re getting into sleep state]. And I wouldn\u2019t listen to the helpful messages it was sending me, such as: don\u2019t train at the gym when my sleep scores were low. I suppose the appeal of these is that you can gamify your own health, and your entire life.\u201d It may sound overzealous to be cross-referencing two devices, but Matthews says this is purely because since he upgraded to the latest Oura ring, it seems to be picking up on his wife\u2019s movements much more than the previous one. \u201cI\u2019ve resolved it by us sleeping in separate beds \u2013 though, to be fair, she is pregnant, so it\u2019s not just about the sleep tracking.\u201d In 2007, in San Francisco, the Wired editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly coined the term \u201cquantified self\u201d when describing the concept of \u201cself-knowledge through numbers\u201d. Now, this ever-growing trend for self-scrutiny has spread to the quest for optimal sleep. Against a backdrop of apps, books and podcasts hosted by sleep geeks, the UK industry for sleep trackers was estimated at \u00a3270m last year and is forecast to more than double by 2030. As someone who once went through a terrible year of insomnia during a stressful life episode, I haven\u2019t dared to use one. It would stress me out to have a nightly critique of my sleep quality. But I am curious. What are these devices actually measuring in order to come up with all this data? Dr Neil Stanley, the author of How to Sleep Well, has been working in the field of sleep research for 42 years, starting out at the neurosciences division of the RAF. He sighs when I ask him to explain how most devices analyse our shuteye. \u201cThese things can just about measure how much sleep you\u2019ve had, and how long it took you to get there,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the only accurate way of distinguishing between light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep is by observing the brain.\u201d He mentions that while one study showed that sleep trackers are now \u201creasonably accurate\u201d, some of the claims made are questionable. But Stanley also wants to raise a more fundamental question. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my career hooking people up to monitors in spaces designed to be the finest bedrooms on the planet. I\u2019ve sat there watching the squiggly lines that measure the different stages of sleep. And, to be honest, it doesn\u2019t mean a thing. Because what even the most accurate data cannot do is influence you to sleep more hours. So, for the general public, what\u2019s the point?\u201d He also says that if there is one night when someone misses out on the sleep they need, the body will usually rebound to catch up the night after. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t improve the quality of your sleep; there are lots of things you can do. I would recommend anyone to keep a pen-and-paper sleep diary of what time they go to bed, how tired they feel, when they wake up and how awake they feel at 11am. In other words \u2013 listen to your body, not data.\u201d Fischer agrees. \u201cPerfect sleep doesn\u2019t really exist. There\u2019s no foolproof recipe, and micromanaging data only creates stress. What matters is: how do you feel? Do you have enough energy to get through the day and feel as if you\u2019re functioning well with a good quality of life? The best way to keep tabs on it is to look at patterns over a week or two rather than obsessing over one or two individual nights. You want to check that you\u2019re feeling well rested at least four nights a week without having spells of being awake for longer than 30 minutes.\u201d Prof Guy Leschziner, the author of The Secret World of Sleep and a consultant at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals in London, also questions the usefulness of sleep tracking. \u201cThere are some intrinsic differences between tracking sleep and tracking exercise.

      "body": "<p>Fan Bingbing, once one of China\u2019s most famous film stars, is returning to the screen after a more than five-year hiatus following her alleged involvement in a massive tax evasion scandal.</p> <p>Fan stars in Green Night, a Hong Kong-produced neo-noir thriller set in South Korea, which is released on US streaming services on 18 October. The film has been billed as Fan\u2019s comeback from professional purgatory since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/25/fan-bingbing-china-star-reappears-after-nearly-a-year-in-wilderness\">she disappeared from public view </a>for nearly a year in 2018. During her year of silence, she was hit with a bill of more than 880m yuan (\u00a399m) by the Chinese tax authorities.</p> <p>The fact that Fan, who once starred in blockbusters such as the X-Men and Iron Man franchises, is returning to cinema in an edgy, international production, which has received scant discussion in China, reflects the likelihood that her fame will never recover to its former heights, say experts.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe she can come back,\u201d said Sabrina Qiong Yu, a professor of film and Chinese studies at Newcastle University. \u201cChinese film stars are very vulnerable \u2026 the fame they have, it\u2019s something that the state never likes.\u201d</p> <p>Fan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/25/fan-bingbing-china-star-reappears-after-nearly-a-year-in-wilderness\">fall from grace</a> sent shockwaves through China\u2019s film industry. Her undoing started in May 2018, when a famous TV presenter posted pictures of two contracts online, which appeared to suggest that Fan had used a false contract to underreport her income to the Chinese tax authorities to the tune of several million dollars. Such a practice, known as \u201cyin-yang\u201d contracts, was allegedly widespread in the film industry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/20/the-disappearance-of-fan-bingbing-is-chinese-actor-a-victim-of-her-own-success\">Fan Bingbing disappearance highlights ties between Chinese politics and showbusiness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fan denied wrongdoing and the presenter retracted his claims. But the tax authorities launched an investigation and in October of that year she was ordered to pay 883m yuan in unpaid taxes and related fines. She apologised on social media and said: \u201cWithout the good policies of the party and the state, without the love and protection of the people, there would be no Fan Bingbing.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, Fan\u2019s career has been muted, although she has maintained a presence on social media and developed her e-commerce beauty brand, Fan Beauty.</p> <p>In recent months, Fan\u2019s posts on Chinese social media feeds have been full of posts about her fashion endeavours and nationalist comments. There is no mention of Green Night in recent posts. On 2 September, the day before the anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender in the second world war, Fan wrote on Weibo: \u201cRemember history, love China, cherish peace, and forge ahead bravely!\u201d</p> <p>Celebrities in China have long been held to high moral standards and expected to be squeaky clean in their personal lives. But in recent years, as the Chinese Communist party (CCP) has deepened and strengthened its control over all parts of society, stars have been expected to be overtly loyal to the CCP as well.</p> <p>Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, has also tightened the party\u2019s control over the mega-rich. After more than a decade of rapid growth and massive wealth accumulation, political leaders have become concerned about elites amassing influence outside the CCP\u2019s control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/11/hong-kong-slowly-becoming-totalitarian-state-says-uk-judge-jonathan-sumption\">Hong Kong is \u2018slowly becoming a totalitarian state\u200b\u2019, says UK judge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sudden crackdown on a darling of China\u2019s booming film industry shocked observers.

      "bodyText": "Fan Bingbing, once one of China\u2019s most famous film stars, is returning to the screen after a more than five-year hiatus following her alleged involvement in a massive tax evasion scandal. Fan stars in Green Night, a Hong Kong-produced neo-noir thriller set in South Korea, which is released on US streaming services on 18 October. The film has been billed as Fan\u2019s comeback from professional purgatory since she disappeared from public view for nearly a year in 2018. During her year of silence, she was hit with a bill of more than 880m yuan (\u00a399m) by the Chinese tax authorities. The fact that Fan, who once starred in blockbusters such as the X-Men and Iron Man franchises, is returning to cinema in an edgy, international production, which has received scant discussion in China, reflects the likelihood that her fame will never recover to its former heights, say experts. \u201cI don\u2019t believe she can come back,\u201d said Sabrina Qiong Yu, a professor of film and Chinese studies at Newcastle University. \u201cChinese film stars are very vulnerable \u2026 the fame they have, it\u2019s something that the state never likes.\u201d Fan\u2019s fall from grace sent shockwaves through China\u2019s film industry. Her undoing started in May 2018, when a famous TV presenter posted pictures of two contracts online, which appeared to suggest that Fan had used a false contract to underreport her income to the Chinese tax authorities to the tune of several million dollars. Such a practice, known as \u201cyin-yang\u201d contracts, was allegedly widespread in the film industry. Fan denied wrongdoing and the presenter retracted his claims. But the tax authorities launched an investigation and in October of that year she was ordered to pay 883m yuan in unpaid taxes and related fines. She apologised on social media and said: \u201cWithout the good policies of the party and the state, without the love and protection of the people, there would be no Fan Bingbing.\u201d Since then, Fan\u2019s career has been muted, although she has maintained a presence on social media and developed her e-commerce beauty brand, Fan Beauty. In recent months, Fan\u2019s posts on Chinese social media feeds have been full of posts about her fashion endeavours and nationalist comments. There is no mention of Green Night in recent posts. On 2 September, the day before the anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender in the second world war, Fan wrote on Weibo: \u201cRemember history, love China, cherish peace, and forge ahead bravely!\u201d Celebrities in China have long been held to high moral standards and expected to be squeaky clean in their personal lives. But in recent years, as the Chinese Communist party (CCP) has deepened and strengthened its control over all parts of society, stars have been expected to be overtly loyal to the CCP as well. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, has also tightened the party\u2019s control over the mega-rich. After more than a decade of rapid growth and massive wealth accumulation, political leaders have become concerned about elites amassing influence outside the CCP\u2019s control. The sudden crackdown on a darling of China\u2019s booming film industry shocked observers. But since then, several high-profile wealthy people have received similar treatment. In November 2020, Jack Ma, one of China\u2019s most successful and well-known billionaires, disappeared for three months, after criticising China\u2019s financial regulators. Last year, a billionaire Chinese dealmaker named Bao Fan disappeared. For celebrities to thrive in China in today\u2019s political environment, they have to be seen to \u201clove the country, love the party\u201d, Yu said. She added that in some instances fans themselves had taken to policing the nationalist credos of high profile figures, without the authorities needing to get involved. In March, the Nobel prize-winning author Mo Yan was attacked by internet users who declared him insufficiently patriotic. In Green Night, Fan stars as a Chinese immigrant, Jin Xia, who works at South Korea\u2019s Incheon airport. While on duty she encounters a mysterious green-haired girl, who pulls Xia into a world of drug trafficking and lesbian romance, and an escape from Xia\u2019s abusive husband. Such racy themes would be highly unlikely to pass the censorship regime required for films to be released in China.",

      "body": "<p>One afternoon in March 2014, while reporting on Russia\u2019s covert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/ukraine-crisis-russian-troops-crimea-john-kerry-kiev\">operation to annex Crimea</a>, I spotted a familiar figure. With his muscular build and shiny shaved head, Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez was easy to recognise from afar. I had first met Gonz\u00e1lez, a freelance journalist from the Basque Country, on a training course for reporters who work in conflict zones. Now we had run into each other in a place that was threatening to turn into one.</p> <p>Gonz\u00e1lez was with a Ukrainian journalist, who had contacts at the besieged military base I was on my way to scope out. He arranged for the three of us to slip inside, where we found a detachment of Ukrainian marines on edge. Outside, an angry crowd of locals was yelling pro-Russian slogans, but these people were just cover for the Russian army, the marines said. They were expecting an imminent visit from a Russian general, and agreed that we could leave a Dictaphone on the base, for them to covertly record the conversation.</p> <p>Some time later, I received audio of the emotional encounter that followed, in which a man identifying himself as a senior general in the Russian army gave the marines an ultimatum to surrender, prompting furious protests. The recording was hard evidence that Vladimir Putin\u2019s denials of Moscow\u2019s coordinating role in Crimea were nonsense. It felt like listening to a piece of history unfold in real time \u2013 the first forceful annexation of land in 21st-century Europe. I was grateful to Gonz\u00e1lez for helping me get the story, but after that day I never saw him again.</p> <p>Eight years later, in the early hours of 28 February 2022, Gonz\u00e1lez was arrested in the Polish city of Przemy\u015bl. It was a few days after the start of the latest and most brutal episode in Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the first moments of which we had witnessed back on the Crimean base. A terse statement from Polish authorities said that Gonz\u00e1lez was suspected of \u201cparticipation in the activities of a foreign intelligence service\u201d. They claimed he was an agent of the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency. He faced up to 10 years in prison.</p> <p>At the time, the story barely registered, given that Russian troops were bearing down on Kyiv. But a few months later, a claim about Gonz\u00e1lez caught my attention. Richard Moore, the head of Britain\u2019s MI6 foreign intelligence service, used a rare public appearance to announce that Gonz\u00e1lez had only been \u201cmasquerading as a Spanish journalist\u201d. In reality, claimed Moore, he was a so-called \u201cillegal\u201d \u2013 a deep-cover Russian spy, usually one who appropriates a foreign identity for long-term missions abroad. Illegals typically spend years in training to convincingly impersonate foreigners. Polish authorities believed Pablo was really Pavel, and had been born in Moscow.</p> <p>I have been fascinated by Russian illegals for years, and have even <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671708/the-illegals-by-shaun-walker/\">written a book about the history</a> of the programme. Now it turned out that I may have crossed paths with one in the field, without suspecting a thing. Perhaps, on that day at the Crimean base, Gonz\u00e1lez had been carrying out other tasks besides journalism. But friends and colleagues from Spain were not convinced by the MI6 chief\u2019s claim. Far from disguising his Russian background, they said, Gonz\u00e1lez had never denied he was of Russian origin. Among friends at home in the Basque Country, he was widely known as Pavel, or \u201cthe Russian\u201d.</p> <p>Two years passed after the arrest. Poland released no evidence to the public, and no date was set for a trial. Had the Poles pounced on an innocent journalist, misinterpreting his Russian roots as something more sinister? Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Spanish wife, Oihana Goiriena, claimed his prolonged detention was aimed at breaking him. \u201cOur hypothesis is that, in the absence of evidence, they want to destroy him morally and emotionally so that he signs whatever they put in front of him,\u201d she told a Spanish journalist after a rare prison visit to see the father of her three children.</p> <p>Then, in August 2024, the biggest prisoner exchange between Russia and the west since the end of the cold war got under way at Ankara airport in Turkey. Russia freed a group of political prisoners, as well as several high-profile foreign detainees held in Russian jails, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/01/evan-gershkovich-wsj\">including the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich</a>. In return, a number of Russians detained in the west headed back home. A government plane picked them up in Ankara, and television crews were standing by when the plane landed in Moscow. On the tarmac, Putin was waiting. A guard of honour stood either side of a red carpet, for the returnees\u2019 first steps back on Russian soil.</p> <p>Out came Vadim Krasikov, convicted of murdering a Chechen dissident in a Berlin park. Then came a husband and wife illegal team arrested in Slovenia, who had spent more than a decade abroad posing as Argentinians. They walked down the steps towards Putin with their two young children, who had only just found out they were actually Russians. Next came a tall, bald and bearded man wearing a Star Wars T-shirt emblazoned with \u201cYour Empire Needs You\u201d. It was Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez.</p> <p>Putin gathered the returnees inside the airport terminal building. Addressing those in the group who had been sent abroad on official service, he said: \u201cYou will all receive state awards, and we will see each other again to talk about your future. For now, I just want to congratulate you on your return home.\u201d</p> <p>For some of Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s most ardent supporters, this was the moment their convictions about his innocence crumbled. \u201cFor the last two years I was always defending Pablo, saying that he needs a proper free and open trial,\u201d one friend, a fellow reporter, told me. \u201cBut you\u2019d have to be pretty naive to think that Russia goes around the world rescuing journalists. I think with this handshake [with Putin], he is proven guilty.\u201d</p> <p>Other friends are still convinced of his innocence, and from Moscow, Gonz\u00e1lez denies he ever had any links to Russian intelligence, according to his Spanish lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, who still speaks to him by phone regularly. Boye told me the fact that Poland held Gonz\u00e1lez in pre-trial detention for more than two years without ever putting him in front of a judge was proof the case was flawed. \u201cIf you have a crystal clear case of espionage, present the charges and let\u2019s go to trial,\u201d he said. \u201cSince when in Europe can something be handled in this way?\u201d</p> <p>In the weeks since the prisoner exchange, I have interviewed dozens of people who knew Gonz\u00e1lez in Europe and in Russia. I have also met with current and former security and intelligence officials in Poland and Ukraine, spoken to those familiar with the Polish evidence against him, and investigated his family history. I hoped to answer some of the questions that those who knew Gonz\u00e1lez were now turning over in their heads. Was there any chance at all he was an innocent journalist, wrongly accused? Or if he really was a Russian spy, when was he recruited? What were his motivations? And how much damage did he do?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I first met Gonz\u00e1lez in 2011, on a week-long training course for journalists in the Welsh countryside. As I pieced together his life story, I realised it had been a key year for him. He started to write his first newspaper articles for Gara, a small leftist newspaper published in the Basque Country. He married his Spanish girlfriend in a ceremony in the town of Guernica. And then in November, he headed to Wales.</p> <p>The course, which is run by former British army officers, aims to equip journalists with the skills to survive in war zones. There is an invaluable first aid component, as well as a role-play element of more dubious value. Back in 2011, we were told to imagine the back roads of rural Wales were in fact deepest Peru. A few minutes after setting off on a \u201creporting assignment\u201d, our fleet of Jeeps was pulled over by two men in bandanas, screaming furiously and waving automatic rifles. They were revolutionaries from the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shining-Path\">Shining Path</a>, one of them said, and we would probably all be shot.</p> <p>As we were marched at gunpoint through the woods, instead of going along with the captors\u2019 demands, Gonz\u00e1lez furiously berated them. Eventually, he managed to persuade our kidnappers to release us all. \u201cWow, this guy is a hero,\u201d James Brown, who went on to have a career in international aid work, remembered thinking at the time. \u201cBut is this the way we\u2019re meant to be responding?\u201d He realised that the line between being a hero and a liability was a fine one, and he couldn\u2019t decide on which side of it Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s actions landed.</p>    <p>Gonz\u00e1lez introduced himself to us as a Spanish freelancer; when I contacted others from the course, nobody could remember whether he had mentioned any Russian roots. But I do recall that he was a passionate and funny storyteller during the long and boozy evenings we spent at the hotel bar. I have a strong memory of him pulling himself up by a wooden frame suspended above the counter one evening, and thrusting his hips vigorously in mid-air, to illustrate some anecdote or other. Later that night, there was a furious argument with a Fox News correspondent, the subject of which is long forgotten.</p> <p>These stories \u2013 the kidnap heroics and the drunken hi jinx \u2013 chimed with many stories about Gonz\u00e1lez I would hear from people who encountered him over the next decade. In some, he came across as a heavy-drinking buffoon; in others, he was a charming presence, skilled at forging friendships and making high-level professional connections, despite working for small Spanish outlets. He frequently reported from war zones, and sometimes showed real bravery. Once, during a shelling attack in Nagorno-Karabakh, he even helped bring two severely wounded French journalists to safety.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if Gonz\u00e1lez was already being prepared for life as a spy back in Wales in 2011, or when we met in Crimea in 2014. But by 2016, the Polish case files allege, he was very much active, using his job as a journalist as cover to get access to some of the Kremlin\u2019s biggest enemies.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Zhanna Nemtsova was 30 when her father was murdered in 2015. Boris Nemtsov, one of Putin\u2019s most persistent critics, was shot four times in the back from a passing car while he was walking home through central Moscow, late one evening in February 2015. A few months later, after receiving threats herself, Nemtsova decided to leave Russia. From exile, she set up a foundation in her father\u2019s name, with the goal of supporting independent media and political activism in Russia. In January 2016, she was in Strasbourg for a meeting that called on the Council of Europe\u2019s parliamentary assembly to appoint a special rapporteur to investigate her father\u2019s murder. It was a largely symbolic move, but in the absence of a proper investigation by Russian authorities, it was at least something.</p> <p>During a break in proceedings, Nemtsova was approached by a tall, confident man speaking lightly accented Russian. He told her his name was Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez, and said he worked for Gara, a newspaper in the Basque Country. Would she grant him an interview? Nemtsova politely declined; she had never heard of Gara and had a packed schedule. But Gonz\u00e1lez did not give up easily. He persuaded a friend of Nemtsova\u2019s to put in a good word for him and in the end, she agreed to the interview. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of the questions, which shows it was nothing unusual,\u201d Nemtsova told me recently.</p> <p>After their first meeting, Nemtsova put Gonz\u00e1lez on the mailing list for the foundation\u2019s public events. He always came, and gradually got to know her better. She found him funny and easy-going. At some point, their relationship took a romantic turn. Through Nemtsova and her associates, Gonz\u00e1lez met many other Russian dissidents. The annual Boris Nemtsov Forum was one of the few platforms where the fragmented exiled opposition, as well as the shrinking number of Kremlin opponents still based inside Russia, gathered in one place. Gonz\u00e1lez came, too; to Madrid, Berlin and Warsaw, depending on the year.</p> <p>As I called around different contacts in the Russian opposition, I was struck by just how many of them had met Gonz\u00e1lez. They described him as a flirty, chatty and warm character who was always up for a beer or six. He was meticulous about staying in touch, and he often acted as tour guide for his new Russian friends on visits to Spain. For one group of Russian exiles, he offered a tour of the Basque Country, taking them to an atmospheric lunch club in a village not far from his home, where he seemed to know everyone. Ilya Yashin, who had been one of Boris Nemtsov\u2019s closest associates, recalled meeting up with Gonz\u00e1lez on a trip to Madrid and going together to an Atl\u00e9tico match. Yashin mentioned he needed a new coat, so afterwards Gonz\u00e1lez took him shopping.</p>    <p>Gonz\u00e1lez would tell his new Russian friends that he was married with children, but he said the relationship with his wife had long broken down and that now they were more like friends. Although he mentioned having some Russian heritage, he allegedly said he had not been to Russia since childhood and even asked his Russian opposition contacts for advice on how to get a visa. If any of them had Googled his journalism, they would have found articles written for Gara from Moscow. They might also have found appearances on the Kremlin-backed channel Russia Today, one of which he used to accuse Ukraine\u2019s pro-western government of paying a Spanish newspaper for favourable coverage.</p> <p>But nobody was doing background checks. \u201cHe was in this circle of opposition journalists and activists,\u201d said Pavel Elizarov, a political activist and former associate of Nemtsova\u2019s. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to discuss Putin\u2019s politics because we all know we are on the same page.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If people encountered something about Gonz\u00e1lez that struck them as odd, they often attributed it to his Basque background. Nemtsova soon realised that he had a different view of the world to her, but she put it down to the specifics of southern European leftism, and decided simply to stop discussing politics when they met. With others, Gonz\u00e1lez often voiced his support for the so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d in eastern Ukraine, which Moscow was propping up financially and militarily. But they found it natural that someone of Basque origin would sympathise with separatist movements.</p> <p>Volodymyr Ariev, a Ukrainian MP, was surprised when Gonz\u00e1lez showed up to their first interview, at his office in Kyiv in 2015, brandishing a bottle of wine as a gift. \u201cHe said it was from his home region,\u201d Ariyev remembered. \u201cI had never met a journalist who brings a present to a meeting before, but I thought it was probably some kind of Basque tradition.\u201d The interview itself was unremarkable, and afterwards Gonz\u00e1lez made small talk about the politician\u2019s family, travels and hobbies. It was standard behaviour for a journalist trying to befriend a new source, though years later, after the arrest, Ariyev wondered if it might have been an attempt to psychologically profile him.</p> <p>In late 2017, Gonz\u00e1lez signed up for a five-day training course run by <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/\">Bellingcat</a>, an influential group of open-source investigators who had done impressive work to prove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/28/mh17-buk-missile-system-from-russia-says-dutch-led-investigation-video\">Russian complicity in the shooting down</a> of a Malaysian Airlines plane over east Ukraine in 2014. The course allowed Gonz\u00e1lez to meet many of the people working on Bellingcat investigations, including the group\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/skripal-salisbury-poisoning-decline-of-russia-spy-agencies-gru\">Eliot Higgins</a>. Some of the other participants would have been of interest to Russian intelligence, too: they included journalists from leading publications, as well as a senior executive of a tech company that would later sign a contract with a US government department worth hundreds of millions of dollars. At nightly dinners and drinks, Gonz\u00e1lez regaled the others with war stories from eastern Ukraine, where he still travelled regularly.</p>      <p>Gonz\u00e1lez also continued to stay close to the Russian opposition, and in 2018 he went back to Strasbourg, where Alexei Navalny \u2013 Putin\u2019s most high-profile critic \u2013 was on a rare visit outside Russia, to speak at the European court of human rights. After the hearing, Navalny and a few others went for drinks at the home of one of the lawyers. It was a friends-only gathering, but somehow Gonz\u00e1lez made the cut.</p> <p>Among the group that evening was a fearless lawyer named Vadim Prokhorov. He was still based in Russia, but flew into Europe regularly for major events. When he first encountered the bulky Gonz\u00e1lez, shaven-headed and speaking nearly perfect Russian, his first association was with the sketchy backstreets of a rough Moscow neighbourhood. \u201cWhat kind of Basque is this? A Basque from Mar\u2019ino,\u201d he joked, referencing the gritty suburb of Moscow where Navalny lived. From then on, Prokhorov always called Gonz\u00e1lez \u201cthe Basque from Mar\u2019ino\u201d, but Gonz\u00e1lez used his trademark charm to ensure the gentle ribbing never morphed into genuine suspicion. \u201cHow you drink, how you socialise is very important for Russians,\u201d Prokhorov told me, recalling those meetings. \u201cI don\u2019t think a sober guy would have made it into the group. But Pablo was always the guy who\u2019d drink, the guy who\u2019d run out to get extra booze, tell jokes. He fit in perfectly. You have to admit, he was pretty good at that.\u201d</p> <p>Some time in 2019, Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Russian friends started to detect a change in his personality. Nemtsova told me she felt there were two different Pablos. \u201cOne was this charming, easy-going guy. \u2018Let\u2019s have a party.\u2019 The other was very rude, and always wanted to say he was better than me. He was moody and aggressive. He didn\u2019t bother controlling himself,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As their on-off relations disintegrated, Nemtsova began to ask herself some questions. Here was a freelancer writing columns for fairly small Spanish outlets, yet he seemed to have the money for constant travel and all the latest gadgets. It reminded her of a phenomenon she knew well from her former life in Russia: the person who lives above their means, the humble bureaucrat with the mansion and the fancy car. In Russia, it was a fairly clear indicator of corruption. But what could it mean in Europe? A possible answer dawned on her.</p> <p>Each summer, Nemtsova organised a journalism summer school in Prague. Gonz\u00e1lez gave a lecture there in 2018, about reporting from conflict zones, and he came again in 2019. That year, Nemtsova recalled, she shared her growing suspicions about Gonz\u00e1lez with another speaker, the Russian journalist Andrei Soldatov, who is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on the Russian intelligence services. Could Gonz\u00e1lez perhaps be a Russian operative, sent to spy on them? Soldatov dismissed the suggestion as unlikely, she said. (Soldatov disputed this account, claiming the encounter happened in 2018, and that he evaded Nemtsova\u2019s question as he had met Gonz\u00e1lez that day for the first time, only spoken to him briefly, and believed the question was motivated by Nemtsova and Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s personal tensions.)</p> <p>The doubts continued to niggle at Nemtsova. Why did this Basque freelancer have so much money? Why did he speak such good Russian? And why was he so interested in the Russian opposition?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Russian illegals traditionally spend years studying language and etiquette, before setting out abroad disguised as foreigners. But \u201cPablo Gonz\u00e1lez\u201d was not a cover identity crafted with painstaking care under the watch of the GRU. It was real, although its owner had another, Russian name too. The two different identities were the product of a mixed heritage, with its origins in the upheaval of the Spanish civil war.</p> <p>Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s grandfather, Andr\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez Yag\u00fce, was among more than 30,000 children evacuated from Spain to save them from the ravages of the conflict. Most ended up in temporary foster homes in France, Belgium and elsewhere in Europe, but the ship that left in 1937 with eight-year-old Andr\u00e9s on board was bound for the Soviet Union. Authorities there planned that the arriving Spanish children would be inducted into the ways of Marxism in special institutions, and when the civil war was over, they would return to newly communist Spain, well prepared to form the backbone of a new political elite. Andr\u00e9s ended up in a boarding house at Obninsk, outside Moscow. In 1939, Francisco Franco\u2019s Nationalists won the civil war, and Moscow decided it would not return the children. Most became Soviet citizens.</p> <p>Andr\u00e9s gained a technical education and found work at ZiL, a huge automobile factory in the suburbs of Moscow. He married a Russian woman, Galina, and the couple had two children, Elena and Andr\u00e9s Jr. In 1980, Elena married a young scientist, Alexei Rubtsov, and their son Pavel was born two years later. By the end of the decade, the Soviet Union was heading towards collapse, and so was Alexei and Elena\u2019s marriage. In 1991, Elena left with Pavel for Spain, taking advantage of their Spanish heritage to obtain citizenship. Elena decided her son should take the maternal family surname on his new documents, and she used the Spanish form of his first name. So it was that Pavel Rubtsov became Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez Yag\u00fce.</p> <p>After finishing high school in Barcelona, Gonz\u00e1lez went on to study Slavic philology at university in Spain. Later, he began to idealise his childhood in the Soviet Union. \u201cI was a tremendously happy child there, and no one is going to convince me otherwise,\u201d he wrote many years later in a newspaper column, painting the late Soviet Union as a place of prosperity and plenty. In 2004, he acquired a Russian passport under his old name, Pavel Rubtsov. By now, his father was working in a management job at RBC, a media holding company in Moscow. Gonz\u00e1lez, or Rubtsov, visited regularly, even doing occasional bits of work for RBC under his father\u2019s watch. \u201cI remember that Pavel was pro-Russian, pro-Putin, but not with any fanaticism. He just seemed fascinated by Russia,\u201d recalled a source who knew both father and son well.</p> <p>Some Spanish media outlets have speculated that the key to Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s alleged GRU links could lie with his father. Intelligence affiliations in Russia are indeed often a family matter, but the source who knew the family was sceptical: \u201cAlexei is a patriotic guy. He was a scientist in the Soviet period and feels the country lost a lot during the collapse. But I never saw anything to suggest he had some other work or any connection to the services.\u201d He described Alexei as a quiet, unassuming person who seemed to be the passive partner in the relationship with his second wife, Tatyana Dobrenko, Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s stepmother, who worked in the oil industry. \u201cShe was in charge of everything,\u201d said the source.</p> <p>To double-check Alexei\u2019s background, I called up Christo Grozev, who was previously the lead Russia investigator at Bellingcat, and now works for an outlet called the Insider. Grozev is a prolific spy hunter, busting the cover of numerous Russian operatives over the years, and was recently told by Austrian authorities that he should leave his home in Vienna, as he is under threat from Russian assassins.</p> <p>Grozev told me he was already looking into Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Russian family, and later shared his preliminary findings with me. He checked Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s father for all the telltale signs of GRU affiliation \u2013 suspicious passport numbers, signs of false identities and official registration at addresses known to be linked to the GRU. The search came back clean. But on the off-chance, he also decided to take a look at Dobrenko, Alexei\u2019s wife. And here, he started to find things that seemed strange.</p> <p>To start with, there were records for two different Tatyana Dobrenkos, one born in 1954 and one in 1959, yet both linked to the same social security number. Even more curious were her official addresses over time. Prior to the apartment where Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s father lived, she was registered at 76 Khoroshevskoye Shosse, said Grozev. That address, in north-east Moscow, is home to a Soviet-era apartment block that is unremarkable except for one thing: the hulking building right next to it, at 76B. The building is commonly known as the Aquarium, and houses the headquarters of the GRU. \u201cThis alone does not prove affiliation with the GRU,\u201d Grozev told me. \u201cBut we do see it is also the home address of other known GRU officials.\u201d It was certainly a striking coincidence for someone whose stepson was now accused of being a GRU officer. I sent Dobrenko a message on Telegram asking for comment on these records. She read it, then blocked me without replying.</p> <p>There was one more suspicious piece of evidence. Last year, the exiled Russian investigative outlet Agentstvo published a story based on a leaked database of Russian flight bookings. One of the bookings appeared to show that in June 2017, two return tickets from Moscow to St Petersburg had been bought in a single transaction: one for Gonz\u00e1lez, using his Russian passport, and one for a man named Sergei Turbin. There is strong evidence, according to Agentstvo, that Turbin is a GRU officer. Grozev concurred, noting his research shows he was employed by the GRU\u2019s Fifth Department, which handles illegals. Turbin could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>In short, during the same period when Gonz\u00e1lez had been telling Nemtsova\u2019s associates that he was struggling to get a visa to Russia, he was apparently flying from Moscow to St Petersburg with an alleged GRU officer. I asked his lawyer, Boye, to comment on the trip. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said, irritably. \u201cDo you know the people who were sitting next to you on your last flight? Can you guarantee that none of them have criminal records?\u201d I pointed out that both tickets appear to have been bought in the same transaction. Did Gonz\u00e1lez know Turbin? Was he on the plane? Boye promised to ask Gonz\u00e1lez. A few days later, he told me his client had decided not to answer my questions.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In 2019, Gonz\u00e1lez began dating a Polish freelance journalist and late that year he moved to Warsaw, where the couple rented a flat together. From Warsaw, he made frequent trips home to the Basque Country to see his children, and regular reporting trips to Ukraine and elsewhere. He secured several high-profile interviews with figures who would have been of interest to the GRU, including the pro-western president of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, and Pavel Latushka, one of the leaders of the Belarusian opposition in exile, and a sworn enemy of the pro-Moscow Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko.</p> <p>It was not until early February 2022 that the net began closing in. With American and British warnings in the air that Russia was about to launch a major assault on Ukraine, Gonz\u00e1lez had travelled with two other Spanish freelancers to Avdiivka, right on the frontline. There, he was apprehended by Ukrainian police and told to report for questioning in Kyiv, where he was interrogated for several hours. The officers demanded access to his mobile phone and accused him of being a Russian spy, but it did not seem they had anything concrete on him. He was advised to leave the country immediately, but not arrested.</p>    <p>In the following days, Spanish intelligence officers visited some of Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s friends and family back home, questioning them about his background. Gonz\u00e1lez was furious when he found out. \u201cThey have gone to everyone with the same song, presenting me as a pig who uses everyone as a cover. It doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he said in a voice note he sent to a friend at the time. The Ukrainians were asking him about his Russian relatives as if it were a secret, he said, when he had never tried to hide his Russian background. That was true, to a point: his Spanish friends knew he travelled to Russia regularly, but his friends in the Russian opposition did not. The basics of Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Russian origin story were genuine, but the specifics seemed to shift, depending on the situation.</p> <p>Gonz\u00e1lez returned to Spain, but when news broke on the morning of 24 February that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine had begun, he immediately booked a flight to Warsaw. Before long he was in Przemy\u015bl, the border city through which hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees were streaming into Poland. He recorded regular live reports for Spanish television channels and news websites. Late in the evening of 27 February, he returned to the dormitory where he was staying, and a few minutes after midnight there was a knock at the door. Green-clad agents of the ABW, Poland\u2019s domestic security service, entered and informed him he was under arrest. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The initial tip-off regarding Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez came from an allied intelligence service, but it was incomplete. \u201cIt was not the case that we had all the evidence and just had to arrest the guy,\u201d Stanis\u0142aw \u017baryn, national security advisor to Poland\u2019s president, told me. \u201cIt was clear from the beginning that this investigation was really big and we would have to dig a lot to see the whole agenda.\u201d</p> <p>At the heart of the Polish prosecutors\u2019 case is a series of reports that Gonz\u00e1lez allegedly wrote over a number of years, apparently to his supervisors in the GRU. \u201cThese were typical intelligence reports about facilities, infrastructure and people to be in touch with,\u201d \u017baryn told me. Another source said these reports frequently reference \u201cthe Centre\u201d, Russian spy code for intelligence headquarters. Some of the reports are understood to have included follow-up questions, apparently from a handler. In one from 2018, Gonz\u00e1lez allegedly wrote to his supervisors that he had \u201cdestroyed the electronic devices as ordered\u201d, smashing them into pieces and tossing them in the ocean.</p> <p>Several sources familiar with the Polish evidence against Gonz\u00e1lez told me that it includes numerous reports on his contacts in the Russian opposition. Some were mundane, like the account of the day when Gonz\u00e1lez took Ilya Yashin to the football. Others allegedly included sensitive information, such as the home addresses of employees of Zhanna Nemtsova\u2019s foundation. One report even allegedly contained copies of personal emails written by Nemtsova\u2019s murdered father. Nemtsova is not allowed to talk about the case, as she is cooperating with the investigation and has signed a non-disclosure agreement, but she confirmed that she possessed Boris Nemtsov\u2019s old personal laptop, brought from Moscow by his lawyer. She also recalled that she had lent it to Gonz\u00e1lez on one occasion, when he claimed his own computer had broken.</p> <p>According to sources, many of the reports detail Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s frequent visits to Ukraine. Since his arrest, the SBU security services in Kyiv have questioned a number of his local associates and even searched some of their homes. \u201cOver the years, his main task was going to different places near the frontline to collect information about the people working there,\u201d claimed a Ukrainian security source I met recently in a Kyiv cafe. The source told me Gonz\u00e1lez had run a local network of politicians and military figures, but the SBU still did not know whether all these people thought they were simply interacting with a journalist, or whether some understood they were helping a Russian intelligence officer. The one thing the SBU is sure of is that a GRU spy with journalistic accreditation could do real damage on the frontline, acting as a spotter to locate concentrations of troops and hardware. \u201cThank God he was arrested before the full-scale invasion,\u201d said the source.</p> <p>While the existence of these reports sounds incriminating, it is not clear if Polish investigators possess solid proof that the reports were addressed to the GRU, or that they were ever actually sent. Gonz\u00e1lez, under interrogation, apparently claimed they were his own notes. He was not given the chance to defend himself in court: prosecutors only made the indictment official, the key step required for a case to proceed to trial, after he had left the country. Part of the problem may be that under Poland\u2019s espionage law at the time of his arrest, prosecutors had to prove Gonz\u00e1lez caused damage to the state of Poland, while most of his alleged spying took place elsewhere. \u201cI think everyone was quite happy when he was included in the exchange and the problem went away,\u201d one Polish former official told me.</p> <p>The prisoner exchange took place at Ankara airport on 1 August. After leaving the plane that had brought them from Moscow, Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, two of the Russian political prisoners released by Putin, boarded an airport bus that would take them to a German plane, and freedom. From the bus window, the two old friends watched as the group heading in the opposite direction was led across the tarmac to board the plane to Moscow. Suddenly, Kara-Murza nudged Yashin and pointed. \u201cIt\u2019s Pablo! Our Basque from Mar\u2019ino,\u201d he exclaimed. Both men knew Gonz\u00e1lez well from his days networking in the Russian opposition. Yashin laughed in amazement at the sight.</p> <p>A few days after the swap, I met Yashin in a Berlin cafe. He was still rather disoriented from his sudden change of surroundings, but told me he wasn\u2019t particularly disturbed by the revelation that his old acquaintance had apparently been a spy. Yashin lived his life expecting to be spied on, so never shared anything privately that he would not say publicly, he claimed. \u201cSo Pablo chatted with me, and then wrote a report about me. I don\u2019t think he caused me any harm. Why does the GRU care what kind of coat I\u2019m wearing or what I think about Spanish politics?\u201d The really scary people were those like the Berlin assassin Krasikov, said Yashin. They were sent to liquidate enemies of the Kremlin, not take them to the football.</p> <p>Without looking into the GRU archives, it is impossible to know just how useful Gonzalez\u2019s alleged spying on the Russian opposition may have been for Moscow. But dismissing it out of hand is probably naive. Writing profiles of targets is a key part of intelligence work. \u201cProfiling tells you how people act, what their views are, what their routines are and what their weaknesses are,\u201d Piotr Krawczyk, the former head of Poland\u2019s foreign intelligence service, told me. Spymasters in Moscow could use the resulting personality profile to craft a recruitment strategy, using either incentives or blackmail. Knowing a target\u2019s daily routines was also crucial, ensuring that the operative sent to make the pitch could be in the right place at the right time. Or, instead of a recruitment officer, the GRU could send someone of Krasikov\u2019s profile, with a gun or a vial of poison.</p> <p>Some who got close to Gonz\u00e1lez have had to deal with a different kind of fallout. The Polish freelance journalist he was dating was arrested together with him, but was soon released after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to hold her. In August, however, a Polish media report revealed that there is still a case open against her for abetting espionage. Nothing has come to light that suggests she had any idea what her partner was allegedly up to, but even so, news of the open case led to an online campaign against the woman. Rightwing circles claimed her previous journalism on topics such as abortion rights in Poland was evidence she was a Russian spy following an \u201canti-Polish\u201d narrative.</p> <p>Nemtsova, too, is still handling the after-effects of her entanglement with Gonz\u00e1lez. For a brief moment, the MA programme her foundation runs at a Prague university was under threat, when a student alleged it had been compromised by Russian intelligence and thus should be discontinued. That challenge is now over; what remains is the psychological trauma of being spied on by someone close to her. \u201cNow I don\u2019t communicate with anyone new, and I have a very limited circle,\u201d Nemtsova told me. \u201cBecause I am a target. You cannot live a normal life under these circumstances.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>From Moscow, Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 or Pavel Rubtsov \u2013 has logged back into his social media accounts in recent weeks, and is in contact with his lawyer and friends in Spain. Some of these friends initially agreed to speak to me, but later called off the interviews, using variations of the phrase \u201cPablo wants to tell his own story\u201d. His Spanish wife also declined an interview request, saying: \u201cPablo is now free and it\u2019s he who will speak with the journalists.\u201d</p> <p>But so far, the only interview Gonz\u00e1lez has given was to Russian state television, a few days after his return to Moscow. In the 10-minute report, he walks the streets of his childhood neighbourhood, pointing out his primary school and other sights from his youth. He scoffs at Poland\u2019s supposed lack of evidence against him and suggests the case is full of holes, though he is never directly asked if he had links to the GRU, and never directly denies it.</p> <p>Gonz\u00e1lez did not respond to multiple requests to speak to me. In a phone call, his Spanish lawyer, Boye, said Gonz\u00e1lez has \u201calways denied\u201d all allegations that he worked in any way for Russian intelligence. Boye agreed to forward Gonz\u00e1lez my interview requests, and later my specific requests for comment, but Gonz\u00e1lez decided not to engage.</p> <p>For those unconvinced by this denial, the main questions that remain are about what kind of operative Gonz\u00e1lez was. Was he really a career illegal, a longstanding officer of the GRU? Polish officials have publicly claimed that Gonz\u00e1lez has officer rank in the GRU, and one former security official told me they were certain that Gonz\u00e1lez \u201cwas recruited at a young age and his whole journalistic career was cover for his spying\u201d. Nobody would say what evidence exists for such claims, however.</p> <p>For now, an alternative theory seems more plausible: that Gonz\u00e1lez was a genuine Spanish journalist with Russian roots, who was then recruited at some point, possibly during his trips to Moscow to visit his father and stepmother. Such an offer would have provided an opportunity to reconnect with the motherland he felt had been torn away from him as a child. It would also have appealed to the risk-taking side of Gonz\u00e1lez that so many people noted in him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/ukraine-fatigue-why-im-fighting-to-stop-the-world-forgetting-us\">\u2018Ukraine fatigue\u2019: why I\u2019m fighting to stop the world forgetting us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another of the Polish officials I spoke to seemed to lend credence to this theory, diverging from what authorities have stated publicly. In this source\u2019s view, Gonz\u00e1lez came across as an amateur: \u201cHe was not very professional, he made a lot of mistakes, and you could see that he was quite lazy with his tasks,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the impression of an incredibly well-trained operative.\u201d If Gonz\u00e1lez was recruited at a later stage, it would also help explain the pro-Russian views he espoused to many people, particularly early on in his career. If \u201cPablo the journalist\u201d was a lifelong cover story created by the GRU, it would surely have been safer to make him less visibly pro-Russian from the start.</p> <p>The only person who can give the full story is Gonz\u00e1lez himself, and for now, a tell-all interview seems unlikely. At the end of his appearance on state television, Gonz\u00e1lez talked about his feelings on the night he landed back in Moscow. He did not say he felt alarm about how he might adapt to life in Russia, nor did he express concern at the optics of emerging from a plane full of spies and assassins to a hero\u2019s welcome. Something else was bothering him: \u201cI come out and see that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is greeting us \u2013 the president! I don\u2019t know if it was visible, but I was training my hand as I was coming down the steps,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, grinning. \u201cI wanted to make sure I could give him a decent, strong, manly handshake.\u201d </p> <p><em>Ashifa Kassam and Pjotr Sauer contributed reporting</em></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was updated on 15 October to include comment from Andrei Soldatov</p></li> </ul> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on X at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, listen to our podcasts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read\">here</a> and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One afternoon in March 2014, while reporting on Russia\u2019s covert operation to annex Crimea, I spotted a familiar figure. With his muscular build and shiny shaved head, Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez was easy to recognise from afar. I had first met Gonz\u00e1lez, a freelance journalist from the Basque Country, on a training course for reporters who work in conflict zones. Now we had run into each other in a place that was threatening to turn into one. Gonz\u00e1lez was with a Ukrainian journalist, who had contacts at the besieged military base I was on my way to scope out. He arranged for the three of us to slip inside, where we found a detachment of Ukrainian marines on edge. Outside, an angry crowd of locals was yelling pro-Russian slogans, but these people were just cover for the Russian army, the marines said. They were expecting an imminent visit from a Russian general, and agreed that we could leave a Dictaphone on the base, for them to covertly record the conversation. Some time later, I received audio of the emotional encounter that followed, in which a man identifying himself as a senior general in the Russian army gave the marines an ultimatum to surrender, prompting furious protests. The recording was hard evidence that Vladimir Putin\u2019s denials of Moscow\u2019s coordinating role in Crimea were nonsense. It felt like listening to a piece of history unfold in real time \u2013 the first forceful annexation of land in 21st-century Europe. I was grateful to Gonz\u00e1lez for helping me get the story, but after that day I never saw him again. Eight years later, in the early hours of 28 February 2022, Gonz\u00e1lez was arrested in the Polish city of Przemy\u015bl. It was a few days after the start of the latest and most brutal episode in Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the first moments of which we had witnessed back on the Crimean base. A terse statement from Polish authorities said that Gonz\u00e1lez was suspected of \u201cparticipation in the activities of a foreign intelligence service\u201d. They claimed he was an agent of the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency. He faced up to 10 years in prison. At the time, the story barely registered, given that Russian troops were bearing down on Kyiv. But a few months later, a claim about Gonz\u00e1lez caught my attention. Richard Moore, the head of Britain\u2019s MI6 foreign intelligence service, used a rare public appearance to announce that Gonz\u00e1lez had only been \u201cmasquerading as a Spanish journalist\u201d. In reality, claimed Moore, he was a so-called \u201cillegal\u201d \u2013 a deep-cover Russian spy, usually one who appropriates a foreign identity for long-term missions abroad. Illegals typically spend years in training to convincingly impersonate foreigners. Polish authorities believed Pablo was really Pavel, and had been born in Moscow. I have been fascinated by Russian illegals for years, and have even written a book about the history of the programme. Now it turned out that I may have crossed paths with one in the field, without suspecting a thing. Perhaps, on that day at the Crimean base, Gonz\u00e1lez had been carrying out other tasks besides journalism. But friends and colleagues from Spain were not convinced by the MI6 chief\u2019s claim. Far from disguising his Russian background, they said, Gonz\u00e1lez had never denied he was of Russian origin. Among friends at home in the Basque Country, he was widely known as Pavel, or \u201cthe Russian\u201d. Two years passed after the arrest. Poland released no evidence to the public, and no date was set for a trial. Had the Poles pounced on an innocent journalist, misinterpreting his Russian roots as something more sinister? Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Spanish wife, Oihana Goiriena, claimed his prolonged detention was aimed at breaking him. \u201cOur hypothesis is that, in the absence of evidence, they want to destroy him morally and emotionally so that he signs whatever they put in front of him,\u201d she told a Spanish journalist after a rare prison visit to see the father of her three children. Then, in August 2024, the biggest prisoner exchange between Russia and the west since the end of the cold war got under way at Ankara airport in Turkey. Russia freed a group of political prisoners, as well as several high-profile foreign detainees held in Russian jails, including the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. In return, a number of Russians detained in the west headed back home. A government plane picked them up in Ankara, and television crews were standing by when the plane landed in Moscow. On the tarmac, Putin was waiting. A guard of honour stood either side of a red carpet, for the returnees\u2019 first steps back on Russian soil. Out came Vadim Krasikov, convicted of murdering a Chechen dissident in a Berlin park. Then came a husband and wife illegal team arrested in Slovenia, who had spent more than a decade abroad posing as Argentinians. They walked down the steps towards Putin with their two young children, who had only just found out they were actually Russians. Next came a tall, bald and bearded man wearing a Star Wars T-shirt emblazoned with \u201cYour Empire Needs You\u201d. It was Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez. Putin gathered the returnees inside the airport terminal building. Addressing those in the group who had been sent abroad on official service, he said: \u201cYou will all receive state awards, and we will see each other again to talk about your future. For now, I just want to congratulate you on your return home.\u201d For some of Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s most ardent supporters, this was the moment their convictions about his innocence crumbled. \u201cFor the last two years I was always defending Pablo, saying that he needs a proper free and open trial,\u201d one friend, a fellow reporter, told me. \u201cBut you\u2019d have to be pretty naive to think that Russia goes around the world rescuing journalists. I think with this handshake [with Putin], he is proven guilty.\u201d Other friends are still convinced of his innocence, and from Moscow, Gonz\u00e1lez denies he ever had any links to Russian intelligence, according to his Spanish lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, who still speaks to him by phone regularly. Boye told me the fact that Poland held Gonz\u00e1lez in pre-trial detention for more than two years without ever putting him in front of a judge was proof the case was flawed. \u201cIf you have a crystal clear case of espionage, present the charges and let\u2019s go to trial,\u201d he said. \u201cSince when in Europe can something be handled in this way?\u201d In the weeks since the prisoner exchange, I have interviewed dozens of people who knew Gonz\u00e1lez in Europe and in Russia. I have also met with current and former security and intelligence officials in Poland and Ukraine, spoken to those familiar with the Polish evidence against him, and investigated his family history. I hoped to answer some of the questions that those who knew Gonz\u00e1lez were now turning over in their heads. Was there any chance at all he was an innocent journalist, wrongly accused? Or if he really was a Russian spy, when was he recruited? What were his motivations? And how much damage did he do? * * * I first met Gonz\u00e1lez in 2011, on a week-long training course for journalists in the Welsh countryside. As I pieced together his life story, I realised it had been a key year for him. He started to write his first newspaper articles for Gara, a small leftist newspaper published in the Basque Country. He married his Spanish girlfriend in a ceremony in the town of Guernica. And then in November, he headed to Wales. The course, which is run by former British army officers, aims to equip journalists with the skills to survive in war zones. There is an invaluable first aid component, as well as a role-play element of more dubious value. Back in 2011, we were told to imagine the back roads of rural Wales were in fact deepest Peru. A few minutes after setting off on a \u201creporting assignment\u201d, our fleet of Jeeps was pulled over by two men in bandanas, screaming furiously and waving automatic rifles. They were revolutionaries from the Shining Path, one of them said, and we would probably all be shot. As we were marched at gunpoint through the woods, instead of going along with the captors\u2019 demands, Gonz\u00e1lez furiously berated them. Eventually, he managed to persuade our kidnappers to release us all. \u201cWow, this guy is a hero,\u201d James Brown, who went on to have a career in international aid work, remembered thinking at the time. \u201cBut is this the way we\u2019re meant to be responding?\u201d He realised that the line between being a hero and a liability was a fine one, and he couldn\u2019t decide on which side of it Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s actions landed. Gonz\u00e1lez introduced himself to us as a Spanish freelancer; when I contacted others from the course, nobody could remember whether he had mentioned any Russian roots. But I do recall that he was a passionate and funny storyteller during the long and boozy evenings we spent at the hotel bar. I have a strong memory of him pulling himself up by a wooden frame suspended above the counter one evening, and thrusting his hips vigorously in mid-air, to illustrate some anecdote or other. Later that night, there was a furious argument with a Fox News correspondent, the subject of which is long forgotten. These stories \u2013 the kidnap heroics and the drunken hi jinx \u2013 chimed with many stories about Gonz\u00e1lez I would hear from people who encountered him over the next decade. In some, he came across as a heavy-drinking buffoon; in others, he was a charming presence, skilled at forging friendships and making high-level professional connections, despite working for small Spanish outlets. He frequently reported from war zones, and sometimes showed real bravery. Once, during a shelling attack in Nagorno-Karabakh, he even helped bring two severely wounded French journalists to safety. I don\u2019t know if Gonz\u00e1lez was already being prepared for life as a spy back in Wales in 2011, or when we met in Crimea in 2014. But by 2016, the Polish case files allege, he was very much active, using his job as a journalist as cover to get access to some of the Kremlin\u2019s biggest enemies. * * * Zhanna Nemtsova was 30 when her father was murdered in 2015. Boris Nemtsov, one of Putin\u2019s most persistent critics, was shot four times in the back from a passing car while he was walking home through central Moscow, late one evening in February 2015. A few months later, after receiving threats herself, Nemtsova decided to leave Russia. From exile, she set up a foundation in her father\u2019s name, with the goal of supporting independent media and political activism in Russia. In January 2016, she was in Strasbourg for a meeting that called on the Council of Europe\u2019s parliamentary assembly to appoint a special rapporteur to investigate her father\u2019s murder. It was a largely symbolic move, but in the absence of a proper investigation by Russian authorities, it was at least something. During a break in proceedings, Nemtsova was approached by a tall, confident man speaking lightly accented Russian. He told her his name was Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez, and said he worked for Gara, a newspaper in the Basque Country. Would she grant him an interview? Nemtsova politely declined; she had never heard of Gara and had a packed schedule. But Gonz\u00e1lez did not give up easily. He persuaded a friend of Nemtsova\u2019s to put in a good word for him and in the end, she agreed to the interview. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of the questions, which shows it was nothing unusual,\u201d Nemtsova told me recently. After their first meeting, Nemtsova put Gonz\u00e1lez on the mailing list for the foundation\u2019s public events. He always came, and gradually got to know her better. She found him funny and easy-going. At some point, their relationship took a romantic turn. Through Nemtsova and her associates, Gonz\u00e1lez met many other Russian dissidents. The annual Boris Nemtsov Forum was one of the few platforms where the fragmented exiled opposition, as well as the shrinking number of Kremlin opponents still based inside Russia, gathered in one place. Gonz\u00e1lez came, too; to Madrid, Berlin and Warsaw, depending on the year. As I called around different contacts in the Russian opposition, I was struck by just how many of them had met Gonz\u00e1lez. They described him as a flirty, chatty and warm character who was always up for a beer or six. He was meticulous about staying in touch, and he often acted as tour guide for his new Russian friends on visits to Spain. For one group of Russian exiles, he offered a tour of the Basque Country, taking them to an atmospheric lunch club in a village not far from his home, where he seemed to know everyone. Ilya Yashin, who had been one of Boris Nemtsov\u2019s closest associates, recalled meeting up with Gonz\u00e1lez on a trip to Madrid and going together to an Atl\u00e9tico match. Yashin mentioned he needed a new coat, so afterwards Gonz\u00e1lez took him shopping. Gonz\u00e1lez would tell his new Russian friends that he was married with children, but he said the relationship with his wife had long broken down and that now they were more like friends. Although he mentioned having some Russian heritage, he allegedly said he had not been to Russia since childhood and even asked his Russian opposition contacts for advice on how to get a visa. If any of them had Googled his journalism, they would have found articles written for Gara from Moscow. They might also have found appearances on the Kremlin-backed channel Russia Today, one of which he used to accuse Ukraine\u2019s pro-western government of paying a Spanish newspaper for favourable coverage. But nobody was doing background checks. \u201cHe was in this circle of opposition journalists and activists,\u201d said Pavel Elizarov, a political activist and former associate of Nemtsova\u2019s. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to discuss Putin\u2019s politics because we all know we are on the same page.\u201d * * * If people encountered something about Gonz\u00e1lez that struck them as odd, they often attributed it to his Basque background. Nemtsova soon realised that he had a different view of the world to her, but she put it down to the specifics of southern European leftism, and decided simply to stop discussing politics when they met. With others, Gonz\u00e1lez often voiced his support for the so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d in eastern Ukraine, which Moscow was propping up financially and militarily. But they found it natural that someone of Basque origin would sympathise with separatist movements. Volodymyr Ariev, a Ukrainian MP, was surprised when Gonz\u00e1lez showed up to their first interview, at his office in Kyiv in 2015, brandishing a bottle of wine as a gift. \u201cHe said it was from his home region,\u201d Ariyev remembered. \u201cI had never met a journalist who brings a present to a meeting before, but I thought it was probably some kind of Basque tradition.\u201d The interview itself was unremarkable, and afterwards Gonz\u00e1lez made small talk about the politician\u2019s family, travels and hobbies. It was standard behaviour for a journalist trying to befriend a new source, though years later, after the arrest, Ariyev wondered if it might have been an attempt to psychologically profile him. In late 2017, Gonz\u00e1lez signed up for a five-day training course run by Bellingcat, an influential group of open-source investigators who had done impressive work to prove Russian complicity in the shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines plane over east Ukraine in 2014. The course allowed Gonz\u00e1lez to meet many of the people working on Bellingcat investigations, including the group\u2019s founder, Eliot Higgins. Some of the other participants would have been of interest to Russian intelligence, too: they included journalists from leading publications, as well as a senior executive of a tech company that would later sign a contract with a US government department worth hundreds of millions of dollars. At nightly dinners and drinks, Gonz\u00e1lez regaled the others with war stories from eastern Ukraine, where he still travelled regularly. Gonz\u00e1lez also continued to stay close to the Russian opposition, and in 2018 he went back to Strasbourg, where Alexei Navalny \u2013 Putin\u2019s most high-profile critic \u2013 was on a rare visit outside Russia, to speak at the European court of human rights. After the hearing, Navalny and a few others went for drinks at the home of one of the lawyers. It was a friends-only gathering, but somehow Gonz\u00e1lez made the cut. Among the group that evening was a fearless lawyer named Vadim Prokhorov. He was still based in Russia, but flew into Europe regularly for major events. When he first encountered the bulky Gonz\u00e1lez, shaven-headed and speaking nearly perfect Russian, his first association was with the sketchy backstreets of a rough Moscow neighbourhood. \u201cWhat kind of Basque is this? A Basque from Mar\u2019ino,\u201d he joked, referencing the gritty suburb of Moscow where Navalny lived. From then on, Prokhorov always called Gonz\u00e1lez \u201cthe Basque from Mar\u2019ino\u201d, but Gonz\u00e1lez used his trademark charm to ensure the gentle ribbing never morphed into genuine suspicion. \u201cHow you drink, how you socialise is very important for Russians,\u201d Prokhorov told me, recalling those meetings. \u201cI don\u2019t think a sober guy would have made it into the group. But Pablo was always the guy who\u2019d drink, the guy who\u2019d run out to get extra booze, tell jokes. He fit in perfectly. You have to admit, he was pretty good at that.\u201d Some time in 2019, Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Russian friends started to detect a change in his personality. Nemtsova told me she felt there were two different Pablos. \u201cOne was this charming, easy-going guy. \u2018Let\u2019s have a party.\u2019 The other was very rude, and always wanted to say he was better than me. He was moody and aggressive. He didn\u2019t bother controlling himself,\u201d she said. As their on-off relations disintegrated, Nemtsova began to ask herself some questions. Here was a freelancer writing columns for fairly small Spanish outlets, yet he seemed to have the money for constant travel and all the latest gadgets. It reminded her of a phenomenon she knew well from her former life in Russia: the person who lives above their means, the humble bureaucrat with the mansion and the fancy car. In Russia, it was a fairly clear indicator of corruption. But what could it mean in Europe? A possible answer dawned on her. Each summer, Nemtsova organised a journalism summer school in Prague. Gonz\u00e1lez gave a lecture there in 2018, about reporting from conflict zones, and he came again in 2019. That year, Nemtsova recalled, she shared her growing suspicions about Gonz\u00e1lez with another speaker, the Russian journalist Andrei Soldatov, who is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on the Russian intelligence services. Could Gonz\u00e1lez perhaps be a Russian operative, sent to spy on them? Soldatov dismissed the suggestion as unlikely, she said. (Soldatov disputed this account, claiming the encounter happened in 2018, and that he evaded Nemtsova\u2019s question as he had met Gonz\u00e1lez that day for the first time, only spoken to him briefly, and believed the question was motivated by Nemtsova and Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s personal tensions.) The doubts continued to niggle at Nemtsova. Why did this Basque freelancer have so much money? Why did he speak such good Russian? And why was he so interested in the Russian opposition? * * * Russian illegals traditionally spend years studying language and etiquette, before setting out abroad disguised as foreigners. But \u201cPablo Gonz\u00e1lez\u201d was not a cover identity crafted with painstaking care under the watch of the GRU. It was real, although its owner had another, Russian name too. The two different identities were the product of a mixed heritage, with its origins in the upheaval of the Spanish civil war. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s grandfather, Andr\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez Yag\u00fce, was among more than 30,000 children evacuated from Spain to save them from the ravages of the conflict. Most ended up in temporary foster homes in France, Belgium and elsewhere in Europe, but the ship that left in 1937 with eight-year-old Andr\u00e9s on board was bound for the Soviet Union. Authorities there planned that the arriving Spanish children would be inducted into the ways of Marxism in special institutions, and when the civil war was over, they would return to newly communist Spain, well prepared to form the backbone of a new political elite. Andr\u00e9s ended up in a boarding house at Obninsk, outside Moscow. In 1939, Francisco Franco\u2019s Nationalists won the civil war, and Moscow decided it would not return the children. Most became Soviet citizens. Andr\u00e9s gained a technical education and found work at ZiL, a huge automobile factory in the suburbs of Moscow. He married a Russian woman, Galina, and the couple had two children, Elena and Andr\u00e9s Jr. In 1980, Elena married a young scientist, Alexei Rubtsov, and their son Pavel was born two years later. By the end of the decade, the Soviet Union was heading towards collapse, and so was Alexei and Elena\u2019s marriage. In 1991, Elena left with Pavel for Spain, taking advantage of their Spanish heritage to obtain citizenship. Elena decided her son should take the maternal family surname on his new documents, and she used the Spanish form of his first name. So it was that Pavel Rubtsov became Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez Yag\u00fce. After finishing high school in Barcelona, Gonz\u00e1lez went on to study Slavic philology at university in Spain. Later, he began to idealise his childhood in the Soviet Union. \u201cI was a tremendously happy child there, and no one is going to convince me otherwise,\u201d he wrote many years later in a newspaper column, painting the late Soviet Union as a place of prosperity and plenty. In 2004, he acquired a Russian passport under his old name, Pavel Rubtsov. By now, his father was working in a management job at RBC, a media holding company in Moscow. Gonz\u00e1lez, or Rubtsov, visited regularly, even doing occasional bits of work for RBC under his father\u2019s watch. \u201cI remember that Pavel was pro-Russian, pro-Putin, but not with any fanaticism. He just seemed fascinated by Russia,\u201d recalled a source who knew both father and son well. Some Spanish media outlets have speculated that the key to Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s alleged GRU links could lie with his father. Intelligence affiliations in Russia are indeed often a family matter, but the source who knew the family was sceptical: \u201cAlexei is a patriotic guy. He was a scientist in the Soviet period and feels the country lost a lot during the collapse. But I never saw anything to suggest he had some other work or any connection to the services.\u201d He described Alexei as a quiet, unassuming person who seemed to be the passive partner in the relationship with his second wife, Tatyana Dobrenko, Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s stepmother, who worked in the oil industry. \u201cShe was in charge of everything,\u201d said the source. To double-check Alexei\u2019s background, I called up Christo Grozev, who was previously the lead Russia investigator at Bellingcat, and now works for an outlet called the Insider. Grozev is a prolific spy hunter, busting the cover of numerous Russian operatives over the years, and was recently told by Austrian authorities that he should leave his home in Vienna, as he is under threat from Russian assassins. Grozev told me he was already looking into Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Russian family, and later shared his preliminary findings with me. He checked Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s father for all the telltale signs of GRU affiliation \u2013 suspicious passport numbers, signs of false identities and official registration at addresses known to be linked to the GRU. The search came back clean. But on the off-chance, he also decided to take a look at Dobrenko, Alexei\u2019s wife. And here, he started to find things that seemed strange. To start with, there were records for two different Tatyana Dobrenkos, one born in 1954 and one in 1959, yet both linked to the same social security number. Even more curious were her official addresses over time. Prior to the apartment where Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s father lived, she was registered at 76 Khoroshevskoye Shosse, said Grozev. That address, in north-east Moscow, is home to a Soviet-era apartment block that is unremarkable except for one thing: the hulking building right next to it, at 76B. The building is commonly known as the Aquarium, and houses the headquarters of the GRU. \u201cThis alone does not prove affiliation with the GRU,\u201d Grozev told me. \u201cBut we do see it is also the home address of other known GRU officials.\u201d It was certainly a striking coincidence for someone whose stepson was now accused of being a GRU officer. I sent Dobrenko a message on Telegram asking for comment on these records. She read it, then blocked me without replying. There was one more suspicious piece of evidence. Last year, the exiled Russian investigative outlet Agentstvo published a story based on a leaked database of Russian flight bookings. One of the bookings appeared to show that in June 2017, two return tickets from Moscow to St Petersburg had been bought in a single transaction: one for Gonz\u00e1lez, using his Russian passport, and one for a man named Sergei Turbin. There is strong evidence, according to Agentstvo, that Turbin is a GRU officer. Grozev concurred, noting his research shows he was employed by the GRU\u2019s Fifth Department, which handles illegals. Turbin could not be reached for comment. In short, during the same period when Gonz\u00e1lez had been telling Nemtsova\u2019s associates that he was struggling to get a visa to Russia, he was apparently flying from Moscow to St Petersburg with an alleged GRU officer. I asked his lawyer, Boye, to comment on the trip. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said, irritably. \u201cDo you know the people who were sitting next to you on your last flight? Can you guarantee that none of them have criminal records?\u201d I pointed out that both tickets appear to have been bought in the same transaction. Did Gonz\u00e1lez know Turbin? Was he on the plane? Boye promised to ask Gonz\u00e1lez. A few days later, he told me his client had decided not to answer my questions. * * * In 2019, Gonz\u00e1lez began dating a Polish freelance journalist and late that year he moved to Warsaw, where the couple rented a flat together. From Warsaw, he made frequent trips home to the Basque Country to see his children, and regular reporting trips to Ukraine and elsewhere. He secured several high-profile interviews with figures who would have been of interest to the GRU, including the pro-western president of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, and Pavel Latushka, one of the leaders of the Belarusian opposition in exile, and a sworn enemy of the pro-Moscow Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. It was not until early February 2022 that the net began closing in. With American and British warnings in the air that Russia was about to launch a major assault on Ukraine, Gonz\u00e1lez had travelled with two other Spanish freelancers to Avdiivka, right on the frontline. There, he was apprehended by Ukrainian police and told to report for questioning in Kyiv, where he was interrogated for several hours. The officers demanded access to his mobile phone and accused him of being a Russian spy, but it did not seem they had anything concrete on him. He was advised to leave the country immediately, but not arrested. In the following days, Spanish intelligence officers visited some of Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s friends and family back home, questioning them about his background. Gonz\u00e1lez was furious when he found out. \u201cThey have gone to everyone with the same song, presenting me as a pig who uses everyone as a cover. It doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he said in a voice note he sent to a friend at the time. The Ukrainians were asking him about his Russian relatives as if it were a secret, he said, when he had never tried to hide his Russian background. That was true, to a point: his Spanish friends knew he travelled to Russia regularly, but his friends in the Russian opposition did not. The basics of Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Russian origin story were genuine, but the specifics seemed to shift, depending on the situation. Gonz\u00e1lez returned to Spain, but when news broke on the morning of 24 February that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine had begun, he immediately booked a flight to Warsaw. Before long he was in Przemy\u015bl, the border city through which hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees were streaming into Poland. He recorded regular live reports for Spanish television channels and news websites. Late in the evening of 27 February, he returned to the dormitory where he was staying, and a few minutes after midnight there was a knock at the door. Green-clad agents of the ABW, Poland\u2019s domestic security service, entered and informed him he was under arrest. * * * The initial tip-off regarding Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez came from an allied intelligence service, but it was incomplete. \u201cIt was not the case that we had all the evidence and just had to arrest the guy,\u201d Stanis\u0142aw \u017baryn, national security advisor to Poland\u2019s president, told me. \u201cIt was clear from the beginning that this investigation was really big and we would have to dig a lot to see the whole agenda.\u201d At the heart of the Polish prosecutors\u2019 case is a series of reports that Gonz\u00e1lez allegedly wrote over a number of years, apparently to his supervisors in the GRU. \u201cThese were typical intelligence reports about facilities, infrastructure and people to be in touch with,\u201d \u017baryn told me. Another source said these reports frequently reference \u201cthe Centre\u201d, Russian spy code for intelligence headquarters. Some of the reports are understood to have included follow-up questions, apparently from a handler. In one from 2018, Gonz\u00e1lez allegedly wrote to his supervisors that he had \u201cdestroyed the electronic devices as ordered\u201d, smashing them into pieces and tossing them in the ocean. Several sources familiar with the Polish evidence against Gonz\u00e1lez told me that it includes numerous reports on his contacts in the Russian opposition. Some were mundane, like the account of the day when Gonz\u00e1lez took Ilya Yashin to the football. Others allegedly included sensitive information, such as the home addresses of employees of Zhanna Nemtsova\u2019s foundation. One report even allegedly contained copies of personal emails written by Nemtsova\u2019s murdered father. Nemtsova is not allowed to talk about the case, as she is cooperating with the investigation and has signed a non-disclosure agreement, but she confirmed that she possessed Boris Nemtsov\u2019s old personal laptop, brought from Moscow by his lawyer. She also recalled that she had lent it to Gonz\u00e1lez on one occasion, when he claimed his own computer had broken. According to sources, many of the reports detail Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s frequent visits to Ukraine. Since his arrest, the SBU security services in Kyiv have questioned a number of his local associates and even searched some of their homes. \u201cOver the years, his main task was going to different places near the frontline to collect information about the people working there,\u201d claimed a Ukrainian security source I met recently in a Kyiv cafe. The source told me Gonz\u00e1lez had run a local network of politicians and military figures, but the SBU still did not know whether all these people thought they were simply interacting with a journalist, or whether some understood they were helping a Russian intelligence officer. The one thing the SBU is sure of is that a GRU spy with journalistic accreditation could do real damage on the frontline, acting as a spotter to locate concentrations of troops and hardware. \u201cThank God he was arrested before the full-scale invasion,\u201d said the source. While the existence of these reports sounds incriminating, it is not clear if Polish investigators possess solid proof that the reports were addressed to the GRU, or that they were ever actually sent. Gonz\u00e1lez, under interrogation, apparently claimed they were his own notes. He was not given the chance to defend himself in court: prosecutors only made the indictment official, the key step required for a case to proceed to trial, after he had left the country. Part of the problem may be that under Poland\u2019s espionage law at the time of his arrest, prosecutors had to prove Gonz\u00e1lez caused damage to the state of Poland, while most of his alleged spying took place elsewhere. \u201cI think everyone was quite happy when he was included in the exchange and the problem went away,\u201d one Polish former official told me. The prisoner exchange took place at Ankara airport on 1 August. After leaving the plane that had brought them from Moscow, Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, two of the Russian political prisoners released by Putin, boarded an airport bus that would take them to a German plane, and freedom. From the bus window, the two old friends watched as the group heading in the opposite direction was led across the tarmac to board the plane to Moscow. Suddenly, Kara-Murza nudged Yashin and pointed. \u201cIt\u2019s Pablo! Our Basque from Mar\u2019ino,\u201d he exclaimed. Both men knew Gonz\u00e1lez well from his days networking in the Russian opposition. Yashin laughed in amazement at the sight. A few days after the swap, I met Yashin in a Berlin cafe. He was still rather disoriented from his sudden change of surroundings, but told me he wasn\u2019t particularly disturbed by the revelation that his old acquaintance had apparently been a spy. Yashin lived his life expecting to be spied on, so never shared anything privately that he would not say publicly, he claimed. \u201cSo Pablo chatted with me, and then wrote a report about me. I don\u2019t think he caused me any harm. Why does the GRU care what kind of coat I\u2019m wearing or what I think about Spanish politics?\u201d The really scary people were those like the Berlin assassin Krasikov, said Yashin. They were sent to liquidate enemies of the Kremlin, not take them to the football. Without looking into the GRU archives, it is impossible to know just how useful Gonzalez\u2019s alleged spying on the Russian opposition may have been for Moscow. But dismissing it out of hand is probably naive. Writing profiles of targets is a key part of intelligence work. \u201cProfiling tells you how people act, what their views are, what their routines are and what their weaknesses are,\u201d Piotr Krawczyk, the former head of Poland\u2019s foreign intelligence service, told me. Spymasters in Moscow could use the resulting personality profile to craft a recruitment strategy, using either incentives or blackmail. Knowing a target\u2019s daily routines was also crucial, ensuring that the operative sent to make the pitch could be in the right place at the right time. Or, instead of a recruitment officer, the GRU could send someone of Krasikov\u2019s profile, with a gun or a vial of poison. Some who got close to Gonz\u00e1lez have had to deal with a different kind of fallout. The Polish freelance journalist he was dating was arrested together with him, but was soon released after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to hold her. In August, however, a Polish media report revealed that there is still a case open against her for abetting espionage. Nothing has come to light that suggests she had any idea what her partner was allegedly up to, but even so, news of the open case led to an online campaign against the woman. Rightwing circles claimed her previous journalism on topics such as abortion rights in Poland was evidence she was a Russian spy following an \u201canti-Polish\u201d narrative. Nemtsova, too, is still handling the after-effects of her entanglement with Gonz\u00e1lez. For a brief moment, the MA programme her foundation runs at a Prague university was under threat, when a student alleged it had been compromised by Russian intelligence and thus should be discontinued. That challenge is now over; what remains is the psychological trauma of being spied on by someone close to her. \u201cNow I don\u2019t communicate with anyone new, and I have a very limited circle,\u201d Nemtsova told me. \u201cBecause I am a target. You cannot live a normal life under these circumstances.\u201d * * * From Moscow, Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 or Pavel Rubtsov \u2013 has logged back into his social media accounts in recent weeks, and is in contact with his lawyer and friends in Spain. Some of these friends initially agreed to speak to me, but later called off the interviews, using variations of the phrase \u201cPablo wants to tell his own story\u201d. His Spanish wife also declined an interview request, saying: \u201cPablo is now free and it\u2019s he who will speak with the journalists.\u201d But so far, the only interview Gonz\u00e1lez has given was to Russian state television, a few days after his return to Moscow. In the 10-minute report, he walks the streets of his childhood neighbourhood, pointing out his primary school and other sights from his youth. He scoffs at Poland\u2019s supposed lack of evidence against him and suggests the case is full of holes, though he is never directly asked if he had links to the GRU, and never directly denies it. Gonz\u00e1lez did not respond to multiple requests to speak to me. In a phone call, his Spanish lawyer, Boye, said Gonz\u00e1lez has \u201calways denied\u201d all allegations that he worked in any way for Russian intelligence. Boye agreed to forward Gonz\u00e1lez my interview requests, and later my specific requests for comment, but Gonz\u00e1lez decided not to engage. For those unconvinced by this denial, the main questions that remain are about what kind of operative Gonz\u00e1lez was. Was he really a career illegal, a longstanding officer of the GRU? Polish officials have publicly claimed that Gonz\u00e1lez has officer rank in the GRU, and one former security official told me they were certain that Gonz\u00e1lez \u201cwas recruited at a young age and his whole journalistic career was cover for his spying\u201d. Nobody would say what evidence exists for such claims, however. For now, an alternative theory seems more plausible: that Gonz\u00e1lez was a genuine Spanish journalist with Russian roots, who was then recruited at some point, possibly during his trips to Moscow to visit his father and stepmother. Such an offer would have provided an opportunity to reconnect with the motherland he felt had been torn away from him as a child. It would also have appealed to the risk-taking side of Gonz\u00e1lez that so many people noted in him. Another of the Polish officials I spoke to seemed to lend credence to this theory, diverging from what authorities have stated publicly. In this source\u2019s view, Gonz\u00e1lez came across as an amateur: \u201cHe was not very professional, he made a lot of mistakes, and you could see that he was quite lazy with his tasks,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the impression of an incredibly well-trained operative.\u201d If Gonz\u00e1lez was recruited at a later stage, it would also help explain the pro-Russian views he espoused to many people, particularly early on in his career. If \u201cPablo the journalist\u201d was a lifelong cover story created by the GRU, it would surely have been safer to make him less visibly pro-Russian from the start. The only person who can give the full story is Gonz\u00e1lez himself, and for now, a tell-all interview seems unlikely. At the end of his appearance on state television, Gonz\u00e1lez talked about his feelings on the night he landed back in Moscow. He did not say he felt alarm about how he might adapt to life in Russia, nor did he express concern at the optics of emerging from a plane full of spies and assassins to a hero\u2019s welcome. Something else was bothering him: \u201cI come out and see that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is greeting us \u2013 the president! I don\u2019t know if it was visible, but I was training my hand as I was coming down the steps,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, grinning. \u201cI wanted to make sure I could give him a decent, strong, manly handshake.\u201d Ashifa Kassam and Pjotr Sauer contributed reporting This article was updated on 15 October to include comment from Andrei Soldatov \u2022 Follow the Long Read on X at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

I think it\u2019s really difficult,\u201d she told Spotify\u2019s The Louis Theroux Podcast. \u201cI think people who don\u2019t make art or don\u2019t attempt to be an artist, don\u2019t understand how difficult it is to have that conviction, that self-belief and everything. \u201cDamien was a young artist that started off with a lot of that belief and a lot of that conviction. He was like a force. And now he\u2019s not.\u201d Emin added that men \u201csort of peak in their 40s\u201d, while \u201cwomen just tend to come and come and come and come and come, so as a woman, you carry on coming all your life until you\u2019re old\u201d. As an example, she cited the France-born artist Louise Bourgeois, who worked until she died aged 98 in 2010. \u201cLike now, if you look at [painter] Joan Mitchell, she\u2019s undoubtedly one of the greatest American abstract painters ever, better than Jackson Pollock,\u201d she continued. But Emin refused to be dragged \u201cdown a hole that I don\u2019t want to go\u201d to discuss the popular street artist Banksy. Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that three Hirst sculptures that were made by preserving animals in formaldehyde were dated by his company to the 1990s even though they were made in 2017. It was also revealed that at least 1,000 paintings that the artist said were \u201cmade in 2016\u201d were created several years later. Emin, who was given a damehood in the king\u2019s birthday honours list for her services to art earlier this year, also said she likes the \u201cpomp and ceremony of the royal family\u201d and believes the UK should embrace it. \u201cI would never, ever, ever want or wish to be part of the royal family, when you see what they have to do and how they live and how restricted their lives are. I think it\u2019s like a kind of living hell,\u201d she said. In 2020, the artist was diagnosed with bladder cancer after discovering a tumour while working on a painting of a malignant lump. She underwent surgery which resulted in many of her reproductive organs being removed and she was fitted with a stoma bag (and later unveiled a new collection of nudes for a show called A Journey to Death, which she said was a response to her health issues). When attending Buckingham Palace to meet the king and queen, Emin brought along her stoma sack in a Victoria Beckham-designed bag. \u201cThe reason why I had to have my night bag plugged in and my shopping bag when we met the king is because these things take time and you don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take for them to come down the stairs and the last thing I want to do is be standing there ready to meet the king and queen and then have to beforehand rush to the loo or my bag burst,\u201d she said. Emin also told Theroux that she had been concerned when he was doing his When Louis Met \u2026 documentary series that art would be treated as a joke. \u201cI was really, really in the public eye in those days, really a lot. And it was, you know, tabloids, all kinds of things, all the wrong things,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you were just going to make it worse for me. That\u2019s what I thought. So I didn\u2019t, but I liked you and I respected, I liked the way you made your programmes and things. \u201cI thought you were an interesting person, but I didn\u2019t want to do it because a lot of people had an angle against contemporary art then, which I thought was wrong.\u201d",

Soon, the surviving trees will be turned into pulp.</p>    <p>Liimatainen, a Greenpeace forest campaigner, and Hakulinen, project manager with the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation, have travelled to the remote forest to document rare species that live there, part of a cat-and-mouse game with the forestry industry. By establishing the presence of endangered wildlife, they hope to prevent the mills getting sustainable timber certification and grant the forest a stay of execution.</p> <p>\u201cThis was part of a massive old-growth forest and it was cut down last winter,\u201d says Liimatainen, pointing to the clearcut expanse. </p> <p>A fraction of Finnish forest is believed to be untouched, often found on or around peatlands, but there is little formal protection from the government. New areas are regularly cleared for pulp and lumber.</p> <p>Researchers say that slowing forest clearance, better protection for intact ecosystems, and improved forest management could help to restore Finland\u2019s land sink.

Increasing forest protection would also cost the country hundreds of millions of euros, <a href=\"http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-380-480-7\">according to</a> the Finnish Nature Panel.

Fossil fuels, rather than forestry, represent the biggest threat to the climate, they say.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Mets\u00e4 Group, a co-operative of more than 90,000 forest owners, says that whenever forest is harvested, new trees are planted, which means carbon sequestration can be increased over the long term. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/25/protecting-just-12-of-earths-land-could-save-worlds-most-threatened-species-says-study-aoe\">Protecting just 1.2% of Earth\u2019s land could save most-threatened species, says study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for UPM, a Finnish forestry firm, says the 2035 carbon-neutrality target is overly optimistic and \u201ctoo many climate policy hopes were pinned on the land-use sector sinks\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe calls for restricting harvesting often miss the point that the state owns approximately a quarter of Finnish forests.

We see similar trends in Canada, very much from disease outbreaks, but also in Sweden. \u201cThese are countries in the temperate north that have factored in their carbon sink as a very central part of their climate policy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a big risk for these governments.\u201d *** In Salla, southern Lapland, Matti Liimatainen and Tuuli Hakulinen walk through the remnants of a rare primeval forest. Black lichen hangs from the branches above enormous, waist-high ant nests. On either side of the muddy track, dead grey trees stand in a sea of green \u2013 an indication, the forest campaigners say, that this area has never been disturbed by humans before. But the road they are on is freshly cleared: a forestry track to allow loggers in. Behind them lies a barren, clearcut tract of land, studded by stumps and bare earth. Soon, the surviving trees will be turned into pulp. Liimatainen, a Greenpeace forest campaigner, and Hakulinen, project manager with the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation, have travelled to the remote forest to document rare species that live there, part of a cat-and-mouse game with the forestry industry. By establishing the presence of endangered wildlife, they hope to prevent the mills getting sustainable timber certification and grant the forest a stay of execution. \u201cThis was part of a massive old-growth forest and it was cut down last winter,\u201d says Liimatainen, pointing to the clearcut expanse. A fraction of Finnish forest is believed to be untouched, often found on or around peatlands, but there is little formal protection from the government. New areas are regularly cleared for pulp and lumber. Researchers say that slowing forest clearance, better protection for intact ecosystems, and improved forest management could help to restore Finland\u2019s land sink. But the cost has led to resistance from the forestry industry. Finland\u2019s finance ministry estimates that harvesting a third less would reduce GDP by 2.1%, costing \u20ac1.7bn-\u20ac5.8bn (\u00a31.4bn-\u00a34.8bn) a year. Increasing forest protection would also cost the country hundreds of millions of euros, according to the Finnish Nature Panel. The state owns 35% of forests, while private owners, companies, municipalities and various organisations own the rest. Finland\u2019s leading timber companies say the country\u2019s forests still absorb more carbon than they release, while acknowledging that the amount has shrunk dramatically in recent years. Fossil fuels, rather than forestry, represent the biggest threat to the climate, they say. A spokesperson for Mets\u00e4 Group, a co-operative of more than 90,000 forest owners, says that whenever forest is harvested, new trees are planted, which means carbon sequestration can be increased over the long term. A spokesperson for UPM, a Finnish forestry firm, says the 2035 carbon-neutrality target is overly optimistic and \u201ctoo many climate policy hopes were pinned on the land-use sector sinks\u201d. \u201cThe calls for restricting harvesting often miss the point that the state owns approximately a quarter of Finnish forests. The government can restrict harvesting in its own land if it is willing to bear the significant direct and indirect financial consequences,\u201d they say. Under the rightwing government that was elected last year, much less emphasis has been put on meeting climate targets. The Finnish government did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. But researchers warn that rising global temperatures are likely to further degrade Finland\u2019s land sink. Studies indicate that across boreal ecosystems, the forest is losing its ability to absorb and store as much carbon. \u201cThere are some really serious scientific scenarios where, if climate change proceeds, the spruce in Finland will not survive, at least in southern Finland,\u201d says Nordman. \u201cThe whole forestry system is based on this tree.\u201d For communities that have always lived in the Arctic Circle, the changes are already clear. As autumn approaches, Sanila-Aikio is preparing for the return of the reindeer from their summer feeding grounds ahead of an uncertain winter. If the dry spell holds, there will not be mushrooms for the reindeer, she explains. \u201cIf they do not fatten up, they will starve,\u201d she says. \u2022 Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features \u2022 This article was updated on 15 October 2024 to correct the job titles of Tuuli Hakulinen and Matti Liimatainen.",

      "bodyText": "Homebuyers and renters who move in near pubs and music venues in some parts of New South Wales will find it harder to make noise complaints under the state government\u2019s plan to revive the struggling nightlife industry. The second tranche of the Minns Labor government\u2019s \u201cvibrancy reforms\u201d will require people moving into designated entertainment precincts to formally acknowledge they will be living in an area of late-night activity. An \u201ceyes wide open\u201d clause will be inserted into planning certificates provided with the sale of homes or apartments in entertainment precincts. It is intended to prevent people from claiming they were surprised by noise. Planning certificates provide all the information a council has on file about controls and other issues that may affect a property. While the proposed new clause will not take away anyone\u2019s right to complain, it is intended to inform the way noise complaints are viewed by local councils and other authorities, including in any sort of mediation. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The minister for music and the night-time economy, John Graham, said the clause should reduce conflict between established venues and new neighbours, as well as give councils more tools to regulate their own areas. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it work in Wollongong and \u2026 it has really made a difference,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe community knows which bits of the suburbs should be lively, but also which bits we want to be quieter and more suburban neighbourhoods.\u201d The government will also launch a $1m grants program for councils to create more special entertainment precincts (Seps), building on the previous success of the Enmore Road Sep in Sydney\u2019s inner west. James Thorpe, the chief executive of hospitality group Odd Culture, operates a nightclub near Enmore Road with a 4am licence and said the local Sep had been \u201ctransformative\u201d since it was introduced 18 months ago. \u201cWe actually have a much better relationship with our neighbours now, because the Sep framework forces vexatious complainants out of the shadows to come and deal with us face to face and solve the problem together,\u201d he said. The government\u2019s latest nightlife reforms also include scrapping several restrictions on licensed venues including a ban on outdoor dining approvals that prevented people from standing while drinking outside. The government minister responsible for the sector will also be able to refer live music and performance venues with legitimate disputes to mediation. The government expects the legislation that would implement the reforms to pass NSW parliament. The Minns government\u2019s earlier reforms relaxed rules on outdoor dining, stopped a single noise complaint from being able to shut a venue down, and reduced licensing fees by 80% and extended trading hours by two hours for places with live music.",

      "bodyText": "Complaints of misconduct raised against Shane Drumgold, who headed the 2022 prosecution of Bruce Lehrmann, have been dismissed by the ACT Bar Association. Drumgold was the ACT\u2019s director of public prosecutions during the criminal trial of Lehrmann, who was accused of raping his colleague Brittany Higgins in 2019 in Parliament House. That trial was abandoned due to juror misconduct, and Drumgold decided against a retrial because of concerns over Higgins\u2019 mental health. In December last year, the ACT Bar Association\u2019s council made a complaint alleging Drumgold had \u201cengaged in professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct\u201d on 11 grounds. After a year-long investigation by senior counsel briefed by the association, one of the grounds was withdrawn and the rest were dismissed on the basis there was \u201cno reasonable likelihood\u201d he would be found guilty. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Drumgold said in a statement he had \u201calways maintained that [his] conduct has been proper and appropriate\u201d. \u201cThe ACT Bar Association has found there is no evidence to support a finding that I engaged in either professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct in relation to any conduct surrounding the prosecution of Bruce Lehrmann,\u201d he said. The complaint included accusations Drumgold misled the ACT supreme court in the Lehrmann case over a conversation he had with journalist Lisa Wilkinson about her planned Logies speech; that he procured a \u201cfalse or misleading affidavit from a junior member of staff\u201d in the office of the director of public prosecutions, which was relied on in the Lehrmann case; and that he told a journalist about a letter he had written to ACT police chief Neil Gaughan, then released that letter under freedom of information laws. In that letter, Drumgold complained police officers pressured him not to prosecute Lehrmann after Higgins\u2019 alleged rape, and called for a public inquiry to look at political and police conduct in the rape. He later said he had no evidence for those concerns. That in turn sparked the Sofronoff inquiry, headed by Walter Sofronoff KC. That inquiry made adverse findings against Drumgold including that he \u201cat times \u2026 lost objectivity and did not act with fairness and detachment\u201d. Drumgold applied for a judicial review, which then found there was a \u201creasonable apprehension of bias\u201d in the Sofronoff inquiry because of Sofronoff\u2019s communication with a columnist at The Australian (Janet Albrechtsen), and that one of the findings was \u201clegally unreasonable\u201d. The ACT Bar Association\u2019s counsel was able to examine the evidence given in the Sofronoff inquiry. The organisation resolved to dismiss grounds one to 10 \u201con the basis that there is no reasonable likelihood that the practitioner will be found guilty of either unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct\u201d, and withdrew an accusation that he had provided false evidence in a witness statement about the letter to Gaughan.

      "bodyText": "The Greens say Queensland Labor\u2019s decision to direct preferences to Katter\u2019s Australia Party candidates in north Queensland electorates is \u201cabsolute pure hypocrisy\u201d, amid the ongoing debate over abortion laws. Robbie Katter, the KAP leader, has vowed to introduce a private member\u2019s bill to wind back abortion rights and access, that would notionally spark a conscience vote. The prospect of a conscience vote has derailed the Liberal National party\u2019s statewide campaign, as the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, and his candidates repeatedly refuse to detail their personal views, only repeating the party line that reform is \u201cnot part of our plans\u201d and has been \u201cruled out\u201d. Labor decriminalised abortion in 2018 and has sought to put the issue at the forefront of the campaign, saying there is a \u201cvery real risk\u201d that reproductive rights will be wound back if the LNP wins government. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email On Tuesday the Greens said Labor should stop volunteers handing out how-to-vote cards in at least eight north and central Queensland electorates that direct preferences to the KAP. \u201cIt\u2019s absolute pure hypocrisy for Labor to be talking about defending the right to choose while making it more likely that hard-right, anti-choice MPs get elected,\u201d the Greens MP for South Brisbane, Amy McMahon, said. \u201cThese are seats where the Katter party has a high chance of winning, Labor preferences could push them over the line in a race against the LNP.\u201d The premier, Steven Miles, has said Labor MPs would also have a conscience vote on any abortion proposal, though the overwhelming majority are on the record supporting abortion rights. The Greens say they have \u201can ironclad guarantee\u201d that all MPs would vote against re-criminalising abortion. \u201cThe Greens will protect abortion rights, and we\u2019ll keep up the pressure on both parties to make sure access is rolled out through the public health system like Labor promised but which they haven\u2019t delivered.\u201d The deputy premier, Cameron Dick, dismissed the claim. \u201cI don\u2019t take political advice from the Queensland Greens political party,\u201d he said. \u201cI never have and I never will.\u201d The Queensland election will be held on 26 October.",

The Czech capital of 1.3 million people has for a long time been a popular destination for noisy stag parties and pub crawlers, largely from Britain. Prague deputy mayor Zdenek Hrib told reporters on Monday that organised night-time pub crawls would now be banned. \u201cIt will not be possible to have guided tours between 10pm and 6am,\u201d he added. Jiri Pospisil, another deputy mayor, said Prague city hall was \u201cseeking a more cultured, wealthier tourist \u2026 not one who comes for a short time only to get drunk\u201d. Foreign beer lovers have for years helped the Czech Republic keep its position as the world\u2019s thirstiest nation. In 2023, a world-leading 128 litres of beer was drunk per head of population in the Czech Republic, despite a steady decline since the Covid pandemic hit in 2020. Beer is still cheaper than water in some restaurants and many pubs in the Unesco-listed historic centre offer the acclaimed local lager for less than \u20ac3 a pint.

Nobody will be banned from going to a pub but these nightly organised pub crawls \u2026 are nothing we would need.\u201d Prague is not the first European capital to start trying to discourage a certain type of tourist from visiting.

The ads describe the risks and consequences of excessive alcohol and drug taking: fines, a criminal record, hospitalisation and permanent health damage. Another campaign launched this year sought to discourage visitors with an online quiz; anyone who answers yes to the questions \u201cWould you like to explore the city with a drink or a spliff/joint in your hand?\u201d or \u201cWould you like a guided tour among sex workers\u2019 windows?\u201d is met with the response, \u201cThat is going to be a hassle.

This is a requirement outlined in the US constitution. The electors are chosen by political parties in each of the US\u2019s 50 states ahead of the election.</p> \n  <p>Different states have different numbers of electoral college votes, with the number decided based on the census. The number of votes is equal to its total congressional delegation: the number of senators plus the number of representatives. While not a state, the District of Columbia \u2013 as in Washington DC \u2013 is allocated three electoral college votes.</p> \n  <p>This is why the total is 538: 100 senators plus 435 representatives plus three for DC.</p> \n  <p>A candidate needs more than half \u2013 or at least 270 \u2013 of the electoral college votes to win. In most states, all of the electoral college votes from the state go to the same candidate. The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, which allocate two electoral votes to the state popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district.</p> \n  <p>The party that wins a state has its electors formally vote for its candidate.

      "bodyText": "This blog is closing now, thanks for following along. You can read our US elections coverage here. After standing on stage swaying while various songs play for more than 20 minutes, Trump finally leaves the stage. It is unclear what that was about, although we are trying to find explanation that makes sense. Trump has already answered questions at this town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania \u2013 it is unclear whether he plans to speak again, or just stand on stage listening to his rally playlist. The large screen behind Trump on stage says \u201cTrump was right about everything.\u201d Here is that clip from Harris a short while ago: Trump is also in Pennsylvania, in Oaks. At the moment he is standing on stage swaying side to side as Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cNothing Compares 2 U\u201d plays. Harris has finished speaking. She makes her way through the crowd, shaking hands with supporters. Harris reminds the crowd that the way people from Erie county vote \u201coften predicts the national vote\u201d. People start chanting \u201cErie! Erie!\u201d \u2013 where Harris is speaking. She reminds the crowd that they can vote early. Erie is a bellwether county \u2013 the way it has voted has been the way the country voted in the last four elections: 2008 Presidential Election: Erie County voted for Barack Obama, who won the presidency. 2012 Presidential Election: Erie County voted for Barack Obama, who won re-election. 2016 Presidential Election: Erie County voted for Donald Trump, who won the presidency. 2020 Presidential Election: Erie County voted for Joe Biden, who won the presidency. Trump meanwhile, according to MSNBC: \u201cWhen freedom is on the line, Americans always answer the call,\u201d she says. The crowd chants \u201cVote! Vote!\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve said for a while now, watch his rallies, listen to his words. He tells us what he is, he tells us what he will do if he is elected president,\u201d she says. Harris plays clips from several Trump events, including, \u201cThe worst people are the enemies from within \u2026 those people are more dangerous than Russia and China \u2026 Now if you had one really violent day, one rough hour, and I mean really rough\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about the enemy from within Pennsylvania,\u201d Harris says, and anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with him. \u201cHe is saying that he would use the military to go after them,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we know who he would target, because he has attacked them before. Journalists whose stories he doesn\u2019t like. Election officials who refuse to cheat \u2026 Judges who follow the law instead of bending to his will,\u201d she says. \u201cA second Trump term would be a huge risk for America, and dangerous,\u201d she says. \u201cDonald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. And he is out for unchekced power,\u201d she says. Harris now takes aim at Trump calling for the \u201ctermination\u201d of the constitution of the United States. The crowd chants \u201clock him up\u201d and Harris says, \u201cThe courts will handle that,\u201d and that voters must handle 5 November \u2013 voting day. Harris turns now to abortion. \u201cOne in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban,\u201d she says. Abortion will also be on the ballot in at least ten states on 5 November: These measures are known as down-ballot measures. Here is an explainer: Measures on the ballot other than the vote for US presidential ticket are down-ballot measures, and a third or more of the roughly half of Americans who usually turn up to vote don\u2019t fill out the entire ballot, according to the US Vote Foundation. Voters do not have to vote for any down-ballot measures for their ballots to count. \u201cYou gotta read the plan.\u201d says Harris, \u201cI mean the fact that they put it in writing is a whole other thing to be discussed,\u201d she says, referring to the Project 2025 document. More on this subject: Harris turns now to Project 2025. She repeats her criticism of Trump as an \u201cunserious man\u201d \u2013 but that the consequences of him being president again are very serious. Some trivia: \u201cDon\u2019t forget healthcare\u201d was one of the three rules Democrat campaign veteran James Carville came up with for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign \u2013 along with \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d and \u201cChange vs. more of the same.\u201d Harris is talking about taking care of her mother when she was diagnosed with cancer. It\u2019s about trying to cook something for them that they might enjoy eating, trying to find something for them to wear that won\u2019t irritate their skin, trying to find something that will make them smile or laugh, it\u2019s about dignity, she says, to applause. She says her plan is that Medicare (not Medicaid) helps pay for home healthcare. The election is about two very different visions, one focused on the past, one on the future, Harris says. It has been one of her key messages this campaign. So far, she is repeating well-worn messaging. \u201cWe need a president who works for all the American people,\u201d she says. We\u2019re expecting this rally to portray Donald Trump as a potential tyrant-in-waiting who wants to jail his political opponents by seizing on his threat to use US armed forces against those he has branded \u201cthe enemy within\u201d. \u201cWe are the underdogs, we have some hard work ahead of us, but here\u2019s the thing: we like har work,\u201d Harris says. \u201cIn 22 days, we will win.\u201d Just over three weeks left\u2026 The Democratic presidential nominee and US vice-president is on stage in Erie, Pennsylvania. Here is the pool report on the number of people there \u2013 about 7,000: The Harris campaign is using about three-quarters of the arena, which has a total concert capacity of about 9400, and appears to have filled it, except for the obstructed seats directly behind the media riser and the space on the floor set aside for press. The crowd is chanting \u201cKamala! Kamala!\u201d And here is a refresher on the electoral college: The electoral college is a group of 538 people, called electors, who officially cast their votes for the US president after citizens have voted. This is a requirement outlined in the US constitution. The electors are chosen by political parties in each of the US\u2019s 50 states ahead of the election. Different states have different numbers of electoral college votes, with the number decided based on the census. The number of votes is equal to its total congressional delegation: the number of senators plus the number of representatives. While not a state, the District of Columbia \u2013 as in Washington DC \u2013 is allocated three electoral college votes. This is why the total is 538: 100 senators plus 435 representatives plus three for DC. A candidate needs more than half \u2013 or at least 270 \u2013 of the electoral college votes to win. In most states, all of the electoral college votes from the state go to the same candidate. The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, which allocate two electoral votes to the state popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district. The party that wins a state has its electors formally vote for its candidate. This happens a few weeks after the November election \u2013 and after US states have certified their election results \u2013 on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. In 2020 Donald Trump tried to remove electors in some states before the electoral college vote but the US supreme court rejected that attempt the week before. Here is a refresher on swing states \u2013 Pennsylvania is the largest of the swing states: A red state is a one that tends to vote Republican, a blue state one that tends to vote Democrat, and a swing state one that swings between the two major parties from one election to the next. Swing states, or battleground states, are where campaigns tend to spend the most money trying to win over undecided voters, or voters who they hope might be convinced to switch from supporting the other team to theirs. Voters in the seven swing states are likely to decide the election this year. The states, and the number of electoral college votes up for grabs, are Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), Pennsylvania (19) and Wisconsin (10). Together they account for 93 electoral college votes, or more than a third of what a candidate needs to win. Swing states are less commonly referred to as \u201ctoss-up\u201d or \u201cpurple\u201d states \u2013 the latter referring to a mix of blue and red. The Harris campaign event in Erie, Pennsylvania has started, but she is not yet on stage. In case you missed this earlier: Kamala Harris has revealed a plan to give Black men more economic opportunities, as anxiety mounts among her supporters that some in the Black community are less enthused by the Democratic presidential ticket than in recent elections, and may sit this one out \u2013 or support Donald Trump. The vice-president\u2019s plan includes forgivable business loans for Black entrepreneurs, creating more apprenticeships, and studying sickle cell and other diseases that disproportionately affect African American men. It also includes ensuring that Black men have more access to shaping a national cannabis industry and to invest in cryptocurrency. Harris presented the so-called \u201copportunity agenda for Black men\u201d on Monday, before speaking in the north-west corner of Erie, Pennsylvania, the country\u2019s largest battleground state. It will be Harris\u2019s 10th visit to Pennsylvania this election season. Political support among Black men for the Harris-Walz campaign has been wavering somewhat. Last week, Barack Obama suggested that some Black men \u201caren\u2019t feeling the idea of having a woman as president\u201d. Kamala Harris will be speaking in a few minutes\u2019 time in Pennsylvania. We\u2019ll bring that to you live. Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate, Tim Walz, is speaking now in Wisconsin, a swing state with 10 electoral college votes. He is talking about the cost of insulin, small business tax credits, and the sandwich generation \u2013 people who are sandwiched between caring for their children and their parents. When asked about Joe Biden\u2019s comment on the possibility of election day \u201cchaos\u201d, Trump dismissed them, saying the real threat comes from within the country, specifically from radical leftists. \u201cThe enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries,\u201d said Trump. Here is the video clip of those remarks: While we wait for that Harris rally to start in Pennsylvania, the Guardian\u2019s Tom Breihan argues that if you want to understand Trump, you should watch 80s action movies. He writes: There\u2019s a real possibility that Donald Trump sees no distinction between the terms \u201cstrongman\u201d and \u201cstrong man\u201d. At the presidential debate last month, Kamala Harris said world leaders were \u201claughing\u201d at Trump. In response, Trump brought up his endorsement from the autocratic Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n: \u201cOne of the most respected men \u2013 they call him a strong man. He\u2019s a tough person, smart.\u201d Two months before that debate, the Republican national convention played host to a strong man \u2013 or, at least, to a man who exemplified a certain 80s-kitsch version of strength. Kamala Harris, who has embarked on a late-campaign round of high-profile interviews after being accused for weeks of avoiding the media, is seeking to highlight the increasingly authoritarian tone Trump has been striking at his rallies. At a speech in Coachella in California on Saturday, he referred to Democratic opponents as \u201cthe enemy within\u201d, saying they posed a bigger threat to the US than the country\u2019s foreign foes, and targeted Adam Schiff, a Democratic congressman who is running for the US Senate. In an interview on Fox News the following day, he repeated the phrase to describe those he claimed were planning to create \u201cchaos\u201d on the day of the presidential election. He said the military should be deployed against them. Trump\u2019s use of extreme language has coincided with an increase in his vitriol to describe Harris, who he last week described as \u201cmentally impaired\u201d. He called her \u201cretarded\u201d while addressing Republican fundraisers in September, the New York Times reported. Harris\u2019s campaign is also trying to draw attention to what it says a dearth of mainstream interviews given by Trump, who instead has chosen to make himself available to sympathetic interviewers, such as the rightwing radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cAs of today, it has been **one month** since Trump\u2019s been interviewed by a mainstream media outlet, as he has backed out of 60 Minutes and refuses to debate again,\u201d Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams posted on Twitter/X. By contrast, Harris is due to be interviewed on Wednesday by Bret Baier on Fox News, an outlet that is usually a go-to platform for Trump but unfriendly terrain for Democrats. Kamala Harris will this evening seek to portray Donald Trump as a potential tyrant-in-waiting who wants to jail his political opponents by seizing on his threat to use US armed forces against those he has branded \u201cthe enemy within\u201d. The US vice-president and Democratic nominee will hone in on the former president\u2019s darkening campaign rhetoric at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, widely deemed the most crucial battleground state in a presidential race that multiple polls suggest will go down to the wire. At the same time, Harris\u2019s campaign is releasing a new campaign advert, titled The Enemy Within, featuring some of Trump\u2019s recent ominous comments about his adversaries and warnings from two former members of his presidential administration about the danger he would pose if elected president again. The 30-second video, complete with footage of Trump walking in front of a row of helmeted riot officers and showing troops on the street during his presidency, tries to concentrate voters\u2019 minds with contributions from Olivia Troye, a one-time national security adviser to Mike Pence, and Kevin Carroll, a former senior counsel in the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cI do remember the day that he suggested that we shoot people on the streets,\u201d Troye says in the ad, which is accompanied with a dramatic musical soundtrack. Carroll adds: \u201cA second term will be worse. There will be no stopping his worst instincts. Unchecked power to no guard rails. If we elect Trump again, we\u2019re a terrible danger.\u201d Kamala Harris will be speaking at a rally in the all-important state of Pennsylvania (the swing state with the highest number of electoral college votes \u2013 19) in just over an hour and fifteen minutes\u2019 time, or 7.35pm ET. This is Helen Sullivan taking over our live US politics coverage, and I\u2019ll bring that to you as it happens. Here are the major developments so far today: Kamala Harris unveiled new policy proposals aimed at black men that include forgivable small business loans and access to a new legal recreational marijuana industry. She\u2019ll speak about that policy in greater detail at her rally in Erie, Pennsylvania shortly \u2013 where she\u2019s also expected to denounce Donald Trump\u2019s statements calling for military force against \u201cthe enemy within.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump is also expected to speak in Pennsylvania today, at a rally just outside Philadelphia. The former president\u2019s social media company, Truth Social, is also experiencing a resurgence as its stock value soars ahead of the election. Harris will appear on Fox News for her first formal sit-down interview with the network on Wednesday. Tim Walz campaigned today in Wisconsin, with senators Amy Klobuchar and Tammy Baldwin and governors Gretchen Whitmer and Tony Evers. At a stop at the University of Wisconsin, Walz warned students that Trump\u2019s threats against the \u201cenemy from within\u201d meant them. Gwen Walz, an educator and wife of the Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz, shared the couple\u2019s fertility journey today in Women\u2019s Health. On Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, the Democratic National Committee announced that it will launch a \u201csix-figure ad campaign\u201d aimed at turning out Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska. It is the party\u2019s third Native-focused campaign this year, and \u201cthe most the DNC has ever spent on a campaign targeting Native voters Tim Walz is continuing his tour of Wisconsin today with Michigan and Wisconsin governors Gretchen Whitmer and Tony Evers. Earlier in the day, Walz spoke with students at the University of Wisconsin in Eau Claire, before touring Lambeau Field, where the Packers play, and meeting with a small contingent of Oneida Nation members. As Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Erie, Pennsylvania gets under way, the vice-president is expected to warn voters of what a future Trump presidency could look like, seizing upon the former president\u2019s recent comments that he would deploy military force against \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, according to a senior campaign official. On that theme, Harris\u2019s campaign is also releasing a new ad, featuring Donald Trump\u2019s former national security aides Olivia Troye and Kevin Carroll. Troye recounts an instant where Trump suggested \u201cwe shoot people in the streets\u201d and Carroll concludes \u201cthe second term would be worse.\u201d Here\u2019s Robert Tait with more: As the Democratic National Committee announces its largest ad campaign focused on turning out Native American voters, Kamala Harris has shared her own message on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. Her post on Twitter/X shows a meeting she held with young Indigenous leaders while campaigning in Arizona last week. Our latest polling indicates that Donald Trump holds a two-point lead over the vice-president in Arizona. In 2020, Native voters were largely credited for swinging the long-red state blue for Joe Biden. Elon Musk\u2019s America Pac has spent $10.1 million supporting Republican candidates across 18 competitive House races, Business Insider reports. The political action committee has spent more than $100 million this election cycle in total, the majority towards supporting Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy. According to Business Insider, which cites FEC filings, the top three races that the Pac has funded are in New York\u2019s 17th district, where Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones; California\u2019s 41st district, where Republican Rep. Ken Calvert faces Democratic candidate Will Rollin, and Ohio\u2019s 13th district, where Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes faces Republican candidate Kevin Coughlin. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has called out the Biden administration for arming Israel as increasingly dire images emerge from northern Gaza. \u201cThe horrors unfolding in northern Gaza are the result of a completely unrestrained Netanyahu gov, fully armed by the Biden admin while food aid is blocked and patients are bombed in hospitals,\u201d she wrote on Twitter/X. \u201cThis is a genocide of Palestinians. The US must stop enabling it. Arms embargo now.\u201d Kamala Harris has differentiated herself from Joe Biden by expressing more sympathy for Palestinians since she joined the presidential race in July, but she\u2019s also maintained strong support for Israel. Here are Guardian columnists Moira Donegan and Mohamad Bazzi on how Harris should position herself on Gaza: Speaking in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, today, Tim Walz denounced Donald Trump\u2019s comments that armed forces should be deployed against his opponents, who he called \u201cthe enemy within\u201d, after the election. Trump made the statement on Fox News yesterday. Speaking to students at the University of Wisconsin, Walz said: \u201cTrump just crossed a line that I have to tell you, in my lifetime, I would have never imagined. He said he would deploy the military against Americans who disagree with him. He called it the \u2018enemy within\u2019. To Donald Trump, anybody who doesn\u2019t agree with him is the enemy.\u201d Read more about Trump\u2019s comments here: As news of Kamala Harris\u2019s upcoming appearance on Fox News broke this morning, another headline from the network passed more quietly: former friend of Donald Trump\u2019s and Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera announced he will be voting for Harris. On Twitter/X, Rivera shared a long post explaining his decision: \u201cAs President [Trump] was a loyal friend, who allowed regular access. My resulting coverage gave him the benefit of most doubts. His presidency was underrated. Throughout his first big scandal in office, the 2017-2019 Mueller Investigation into allegations Trump conspired with Russia to undermine our political process, I stuck with him, deeply suspicious of constant efforts to undermine his Administration.\u201d \u201cIf you are a Republican, Donald Trump has made a liar of you. He has coaxed and intimidated tens of millions into pretending he was reelected in 2020, and that the election was stolen,\u201d Rivera continued. \u201cFormer President Trump is a sore loser who cannot be trusted to honor the Constitution. That is why I am voting for Kamala Harris to be our 47th President.\u201d With both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump traveling to Pennsylvania today, CNN reports that one-fifth of all advertising money that has been spent on the race since Harris became the nominee has targeted the state. According to Guardian polling, Harris holds a narrow one-point lead in the state, while a recent New York Times report shows her four points ahead of her opponent there. Tim Walz is campaigning today in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, with senators Amy Klobuchar and Tammy Baldwin. Joking about the support from across the political spectrum that Kamala Harris has received in recent weeks, Klobuchar told students at the University of Wisconsin: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna see like a bus going through western Wisconsin with \u2013 I want you to picture this \u2013 Bernie Sanders and Dick Cheney together holding a sign that says brat fall.\u201d If you were looking for a break from the election cycle this weekend, you may have taken a trip to the movies \u2013 only to find no such break to be had. The Apprentice, a two-hour biopic focused on Donald Trump\u2019s early life, hit theaters on Friday. Here\u2019s Victoria Bekiempis on the former president\u2019s less-than-thrilled reaction: Donald Trump railed against a just released biopic about his life in a social media screed early on Monday, calling it a \u201ccheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job\u201d meant to thwart his presidential candidacy. The Apprentice portrays how Trump created his real estate empire under the tutelage of Roy Cohn, a notoriously cutthroat attorney and power-broker in 1970s and 1980s New York City, Intelligencer notes. Trump is played by the Marvel actor Sebastian Stan and Cohn by the Succession star Jeremy Strong. Trump\u2019s ex-wife Ivana Trump is played by Maria Bakalova \u2013 whose breakout role in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm landed her an Academy award nomination. There is a disclaimer at the beginning of The Apprentice indicating that portions were \u201cfictionalized for dramatic purposes\u201d, Intelligencer notes. In his rant Trump described the film as \u201cfake and classless\u201d. Trump said he hoped it would \u201cbomb\u201d and alleged that it was \u201cput out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, \u2018MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u2019\u201d This Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, the Democratic National Committee has announced that it will launch a \u201csix-figure ad campaign\u201d aimed at turning out Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska. It is the party\u2019s third Native-focused campaign this year, and \u201cthe most the DNC has ever spent on a campaign targeting Native voters\u201d, according to the committee. In 2020, Native voters were crucial to swinging Arizona \u2013 a traditionally Republican state \u2013 for Joe Biden. \u201cNative American people will absolutely help decide the results of this election,\u201d Minnesota Lt Gov Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, said in a statement announcing the ads. If Kamala Harris wins the election, making Minnesota governor Tim Walz her vice-president, Flanagan would become the first Native American woman to serve as a state\u2019s governor. Democratic and Republican leaders have celebrated today\u2019s holiday in markedly different ways. While the Trump campaign has tweeted \u201cHappy Columbus Day\u201d while saying \u201cRadical left Marxist Kamala Harris thinks that this holiday celebrating the discovery of the Americas and the birth of western civilization is a bad thing,\u201d the vice-president has yet to make any statement on the holiday. A Gallup News poll released today found that Americans\u2019 trust in the media is still at record lows, as has been the case since 2016. For the third year in a row, Gallup found that more adults have no trust at all in the media than trust it a great deal or fair amount. The news is particularly profound as election day approaches: Gallup found the media is the least trusted group among 10 civic and political institutions involved in the democratic process, such as state and local governments, the judiciary and Congress. In the 1970s, Gallup first reported that trust in the media hovered around 70% \u2013 though that percentage began to fall in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as about 50% of Americans reported trusting the news. Only about a third of Americans said they trusted the media in 2016. Trust in the media correlates with party affiliation and age, Gallup reports. Currently, 54% of Democrats, 27% of independents and 12% of Republicans say they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. Meanwhile, older Americans trust the media at higher rates than their younger peers (only 31% of Democrats between the ages of 18 and 29, versus 74% of those 65 and older). Ex-president Bill Clinton has been campaigning for Kamala Harris in Georgia this weekend. At a campaign stop today, he told voters: \u201cYou have to realize it is literally possible that the whole election could be decided here.\u201d According to our most recent polling, Donald Trump is currently leading Kamala Harris by one point in the Peach state. A recent poll from the New York Times shows the same. The state\u2019s elections have been in the spotlight since 2020, when then Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger refused to change the election results in Trump\u2019s favor. For more on the state of the election, and election interference, in Georgia, consider: Kamala Harris will appear on Fox News for her first formal sit-down interview with the network on Wednesday. The interview, with the network\u2019s chief political anchor Bret Baier, will air Wednesday at 6pm ET. Although the conservative outlet generally airs content that supports Republican nominee Donald Trump, the vice-president\u2019s appearance signals the inroads she is attempting to make among Republicans. In campaign events across the country, Harris has spoken in front of banners reading \u201cCountry Over Party\u201d and alongside guests such as Liz Cheney. Her running mate, Tim Walz, has appeared on Fox News Sunday twice this month, and other Democratic proxies such as Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, and Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, have spoken on the network in recent weeks as well. With election day nearing, both the Harris and Trump campaigns are closely tracking every potential vote in hotly contested swing states such as Pennsylvania and Arizona. But, according to the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell, there\u2019s an issue with the Trump campaign\u2019s software that\u2019s made it difficult for them to know whether their ground game operation is reaching target voters. Here\u2019s Hugo: The Trump campaign this cycle is targeting so-called low propensity Trump voters, who are often in rural areas, as part of their bet that hitting those people who don\u2019t typically vote but would cast a ballot for Trump if they did, could make a difference in a close election. But the Trump campaign and the Elon Musk-backed America Pac, which is now doing an outsized portion of the Trump ground game, use a management app called Campaign Sidekick that struggles in areas with slow internet and means canvassers have to use an offline version. The Campaign Sidekick app effectively forces canvassers who have less than 40mbps of internet \u2013 sufficient to stream 4K video \u2013 to use \u201coffline walkbooks\u201d which have no geo-tracking feature and do not always upload after a route is completed, the people said. As a result, the Trump campaign and America Pac then have little way to know whether canvassers are actually knocking on doors or whether they are cheating \u2013 for instance, by \u201cspeed-running\u201d routes where they literally throw campaign materials at doors as they drive past. For more, continue reading here: Black lawmakers are calling for an investigation of Tom Barrett, a Republican running for Michigan\u2019s vacant seat in the House of Representatives, after his campaign published an ad in a Black-owned newspaper incorrectly listing election day as 6 November. The complaint, filed by the Michigan Legislative Black caucus, accuses Barrett of purposely attempting to mislead Black voters to suppress their vote: \u201cAt best, Tom Barrett and his Campaign have committed a shocking oversight which will undoubtedly lead to confusion by Black voters in Lansing. And, at worst, this ad could be part of an intentional strategy to \u2018deter\u2019 Black voters by deceiving them into showing up to vote on the day after the 2024 election.\u201d Barrett\u2019s campaign told the Washington Post the mistake was \u201cnothing but a proofing error\u201d, noting other mailers it has sent to Black voters with the correct date. Barrett is currently running against Democrat Curtis Hertel to fill the seat left vacant by Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat who is running for Senate. The outcome of the race could determine which party controls the House in the new year. Gwen Walz, an educator and wife of the Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz, is sharing the couple\u2019s fertility journey today in Women\u2019s Health. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy to tell this story, and I think all of us who speak about our reproductive challenges wish we didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Gwen Walz told the magazine. \u201cEarlier this year, Tim and I were in his office at the Minnesota State Capitol, getting ready to do a press conference, when we heard the news that the Alabama Supreme Court had ruled that embryos have personhood, which effectively halted IVF treatments in the state as clinics and hospitals tried to figure out what to do. We looked at each other, and we were both just right back there, all those years ago, when we were trying to start our own family and going through our own fertility treatments.\u201d Walz goes on to describe the couple\u2019s experience trying intrauterine insemination (a fertility treatment that her husband incorrectly referred to as IVF earlier in the campaign) and the joy they felt when they learned they had conceived their daughter Hope, who today is 23. She concludes by speaking about her sadness that Hope will not have the same reproductive freedoms, and worry that that will worsen if Donald Trump is re-elected in November, before urging readers to vote for the Harris-Walz ticket. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both returning to Pennsylvania today \u2013 a state they and their proxies have frequented over the past month. Last week, former president Barack Obama rallied voters in Pittsburgh to vote blue downballot, while also specifically calling on Black men to support the vice-president. Meanwhile, earlier on 5 October, Trump held one of his largest rallies in Butler, the site of his near-assassination in July. Today, Harris will rally voters in Erie \u2013 in the state\u2019s far north-west corner \u2013 while Trump speaks just outside Philadelphia. Although the state\u2019s leadership is largely Democratic \u2013 Pennsylvania has elected a Democratic governor three times in a row, and both of the state\u2019s senators are also Democrats \u2013 the margin for victory in Pennsylvania is narrow. The state\u2019s natural gas industry could sway the election in a state that holds 19 electoral votes \u2013 the most of any swing state. Current Guardian polling shows Harris leading the state by a narrow one-point margin, while a recent New York Times poll shows the vice-president leading in the Keystone state by four points. We\u2019ll be following both campaigns\u2019 appearances in Pennsylvania today and keep you apprised of any developments. White House press aides scrap \u2013 Axios Take a break for a moment from the endless campaign coverage and feverish polls speculation and enjoy an old fashioned gossipy report on in-house bickering at the White House. The protagonists are Joe Biden\u2019s press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and national security spokesperson John Kirby. Apparently, Axios gleefully reports, KJP has been \u201cblocking\u201d Kirby from appearances at the press podium. \u201cHaving both of them at the podium was what Biden wanted, but Jean-Pierre thought that Kirby\u2019s presence gave the impression she needed a chaperone, people familiar with her thinking told Axios.\u201d Full details here. Truth Social stock rallies CNN is reporting on a recent stock market rally in Donald Trump\u2019s social media platform Truth Social. Truth Social has far more often been the subject of mockery and schadenfreude as its value has largely headed downwards since its stock market debut. But CNN reports that recently it has soared. \u201cUp until very recently, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group had been in meltdown mode. Its share price dropped to a record low of $12.15 on September 23, marking a stunning 82% crash from its high. But the owner of Truth Social is enjoying a massive rebound, more than doubling its share price in less than three weeks. It spiked nearly 50% last week alone. It\u2019s a remarkable turnaround, even for a notoriously-volatile stock that has been described as a meme stock on steroids.\u201d The reason? Market speculation that Trump could be heading back to the White House. Voter registration worries for Harris in key swing states The incredibly right races in the seven crucial battleground states have been a feature of the 2024 election almost from the start \u2013 and especially since Kamala Harris entered the race. But Democratic jitters \u2013 already at peak intensity \u2013 are unlikely to be soothed by a Hill report showing worrying signs re \u2013 Democrat voter registration. Key points: \u201cDemocrats\u2019 voter registration advantage has dropped in three key battleground states \u2013 Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada \u2013 raising a red flag for Vice President Harris as experts cite a lack of enthusiasm for the Biden administration brand and the Democratic Party, generally, as problems. In Arizona, another key battleground state, Republicans have seen their voter registration advantage increase substantially, which could make it tougher for Harris to carry a state that President Biden narrowly won in 2020.\u201d A full report here. Good news for Democrats in Senate Suffice to say, that in recent days the mood among many Democrats has turned a little sour as November\u2019s election date gets ever closer. There is deep nervousness about the state of the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, especially as poll after poll shows the crucial swing states are on a knife-edge. But Politico has a little cheer for Democrats with an internal memo from a Repuplican Super Pac showing the party\u2019s chances of extending power in the Senate is looking grim. \u201cThe new round of October polling from the Senate Leadership Fund shows all but one Republican candidate running behind Donald Trump in battleground states, a pattern that could sharply limit their ability to build a sizable majority unless they can force a change in the final weeks of the election,\u201d the memo says. More details and a full report here. Harris and Trump have both been making regular appearances in Pennsylvania, the country\u2019s largest battleground state. Today will be Harris\u2019s 10th visit to Pennsylvania this campaign, and just last week Trump made stops in both Scranton and Reading in the state. AP provides some background on the key battleground state where both candidates will speak today: Pennsylvania\u2019s energy industry and natural gas fracking are likely topics as they compete for the fraction of the state\u2019s voters who have not made up their minds. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential race. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania on his way to winning the presidency in 2016, but native Scrantonian Joe Biden edged Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago. Harris will be holding a rally in Erie, a Democratic majority city of about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state\u2019s reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29. Trump plans a town hall Monday at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center and Fairgrounds in suburban Oaks, hoping to drive up turnout among his supporters. Pennsylvania\u2019s 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state, have long made it a center of presidential electioneering. Democrats have won three straight elections for governor and both current U.S. senators are Democrats, but its legislature is closely divided and both parties have had recent success in statewide contests. Three polls released yesterday show the candidates locked in a close battle for the White House. A New York Times poll found that Harris is underperforming the last three Democratic candidates for the White House among Latino voters. An NBC News poll showed the candidates in a \u201cdead heat\u201d nationally at 48% support. The poll found that voters are reassessing Trump\u2019s first term more favourably \u2013 but also that voters view reproductive rights as a top motivating issue, which could hurt the former president after three of his US supreme court appointees eliminated the federal right to abortion. A CBS News poll found that the presidential race is more than just two conflicting ideologies \u2013 but about a fundamental disconnection. Each poll contained positive signs for Harris, including a five-point advantage on \u201clooking out for middle class\u201d (ABC); abortion being \u201c#1 motivating issue\u201d (NBC), with Democrat up 19 points on the issue over Trump (New York Times); Trump\u2019s Latino support at the same level from 2020 (CBS), and also Harris matching Biden in 2020 with Black voters. You can read more analysis of the latest polls by Edward Helmore in the story below. In the Middle East, Iran has said it sees \u201cno grounds\u201d for indirect talks with the US via Oman. \u201cCurrently we don\u2019t see any ground for these talks, until we can get past the current crisis,\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said on Monday, adding the process had been halted \u201cdue to the specific conditions of the region\u201d. It comes amid expectations that Israel could launch an attack on Iran. On Sunday it was announced that the US will send an antimissile system to Israel as well as a crew of US military personnel to operate the system. In a statement released on Sunday, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said that the US will send an \u201cassociated crew of US military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel\u2019s air defenses\u201d. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump offer two starkly different visions for the country with much at stake \u2013 from pocketbook economic issues and reproductive rights to the strength of the country\u2019s global alliances and existential questions about the future of American democracy and the planet. As they compete for the White House, both candidates have laid out their plans in speeches, campaign ads and media interviews. Most of it amounts to a wish list, sketched out in broad strokes and lacking concrete details about how they would be implemented or paid for. A number of Trump\u2019s proposals raise legal questions, while some of Harris\u2019s would probably require Democratic control of Congress. You can see where they stand on the key issues here: Like Trump, Kamala Harris will be in Pennsylvania this evening. The vice-president will attend an evening campaign rally in Erie, where she is to appear with Democratic senator John Fetterman. Kamala Harris unveiled new policy proposals aimed at black men on Monday that include forgivable small business loans and access to a new legal recreational marijuana industry, Reuters reports. The Harris campaign and Democrats \u2013 including former president Barack Obama \u2013 have expressed deep concern about whether black males will turn out on 5 November in numbers seen in past elections and whether they will support Harris or her Republican rival. The new policies, directly pitched at the black male electorate, include one million loans that are fully forgivable of up to $20,000 to entrepreneurs in underserved communities, and a promise to legalise recreational marijuana and help ensure black entrepreneurs have access to the new industry. Other proposals include boosting access to the cryptocurrency industry for black Americans and launching a national health equity initiative focused on black men that addresses diseases like sickle cell, which disproportionately impacts the community. Reuters provides more detail on the man who was arrested at a security checkpoint near a Trump rally on Saturday. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said he believed his department halted an assassination attempt, though he acknowledged that was \u201cspeculation\u201d. The man faces gun charges after he was found in possession of loaded firearms, multiple passports and a fake license plate. The suspect was released on bail on Saturday, jail records showed. A federal official said on Sunday that a federal investigation was underway. \u201cWhat we do know is he showed up with multiple passports with different names, an unregistered vehicle with a fake license plate and loaded firearms,\u201d the sheriff said at a news conference yesterday. \u201cI truly do believe that we prevented another assassination attempt.\u201d The 49-year-old man, identified as Las Vegas resident Vem Miller, was stopped in a black SUV by sheriff\u2019s deputies around 5pm local time on Saturday and taken into custody without incident, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. Trump had not yet taken the stage. Jail records show Miller was released on $5,000 bail on Saturday after being charged with possession of a loaded firearm and a high-capacity magazine. \u201cThe incident did not impact the safety of former President Trump or attendees of the event,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said in a press release. The US Attorney\u2019s Los Angeles office, in a statement on its web site on Sunday, also said Trump was not in danger, citing the US Secret Service. Donald Trump will speak in Oaks, Pennsylvania, later today. News of the event, posted on Trump\u2019s website, gives a flavour of what the candidate might speak about: Pennsylvania voters are no stranger to the disastrous policies of the Harris-Biden administration. Pennsylvanians are paying nearly $1,000 extra per month for the same basket of goods due to Kamala\u2019s inflation crisis. At the same time hardworking Pennsylvanians are bringing home real wages worth less and racking up more credit card debt. Gas and diesel prices hit historic highs thanks to the Harris-Biden administration\u2019s crackdown on American energy and Pennsylvania fracking. More broadly, Pennsylvania has been on the receiving end of America\u2019s lopsided trade deals that have allowed foreign adversaries to hollow out our industry. Countless factories have shuttered, and countless more quality American jobs have been lost thanks the nonsensical dogma of \u2018free trade.\u2019 A Trump-Vance administration will pick up where the first Trump administration left off to fuel an American revival of strong job growth, low inflation, and prosperity for everyday Pennsylvanians. President Trump will unleash Pennsylvania energy and get back to re-writing America\u2019s faulty trade agreements to support the Pennsylvania industrial prowess that built America. US officials said they were monitoring China\u2019s military drills around Taiwan. China launched its latest war games around the democratically-governed island in response to a speech made by Taiwan\u2019s president Lai Ching-te last week. Lai said China and Taiwan are not \u201csubordinate to each other\u201d and China has \u201cno right to represent Taiwan\u201d. \u201cWe call on the PRC to act with restraint and to avoid any further actions that may undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the broader region, which is essential to regional peace and prosperity and a matter of international concern,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, using the initials for the People\u2019s Republic of China, China\u2019s official name. Donald Trump pledged on Sunday to hire an extra 10,000 border patrol agents if he is reelected as president as he steps up his hardline rhetoric on immigration, Reuters reports. The Republican presidential candidate said he would meet the goal by asking Congress to fund a 10% pay rise for border patrol agents and a $10,000 retention and signing bonus, at a rally in the border state of Arizona, an election battleground. There are currently about 20,000 border patrol officers, so the pledge would see a sizeable increase in the force. Flanked on stage by leaders of the Border Patrol union, who have endorsed Trump, the former president said: \u201cThis will ensure that we can hire and keep the Border Patrol agents that we need.\u201d Trump has noticeably hardened his anti-immigration rhetoric in the final weeks of the campaign. Last month he called immigrants in the US illegally who commit violent crimes \u201cmonsters,\u201d \u201cstone-cold killers\u201d and \u201cvile animals.\u201d On Friday he called for the death penalty for \u201cany migrant\u201d who kills a US citizen. Critics say Trump\u2019s rhetoric reinforces racist tropes \u2013 studies generally find there is no evidence immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans. Good morning and welcome to the US elections blog with a little over three weeks to go until Americans head to the polls. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris were speaking last night and are back on the campaign trail today with both expected to hold events later in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Here\u2019s a round-up of what happened overnight in the US. A man with a shotgun, loaded handgun, ammunition and several fake passports in his vehicle was arrested at a security checkpoint outside Donald Trump\u2019s rally Saturday night in the Southern California desert, police said. He was released the same day on $5,000 bail. The suspect, a 49-year-old resident of Las Vegas, was driving an unregistered black SUV with a \u201chomemade\u201d license plate that was stopped by deputies assigned to the rally in Coachella, east of Los Angeles, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said at a news conference. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump spent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs. Polls show them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. Trump pledged on Sunday to hire an extra 10,000 border patrol agents if he is reelected as president. The Republican presidential candidate said he would meet the goal by asking the US Congress to fund a 10% pay rise for border patrol agents and a $10,000 retention and signing bonus, at a rally in the border state of Arizona, an election battleground. Harris held a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, where she attacked her rival for spreading misinformation related to hurricanes Helene and Milton. \u201cFrom him, we are just hearing from that same, old tired playbook,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. He is only focused on himself.\u201d Both Harris and Trump will be in Pennsylvania later today. Harris is speaking in the city of Erie and Trump is on the stump in Oaks, a small community about 20 miles from Philadelphia. Speaker Mike Johnson said that passing additional hurricane aid for states impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton \u201ccan wait\u201d until Congress is back in session after the election. Three major polls were released Sunday, showing Kamala Harris either ahead of Donald Trump or running a head-to-head race.",
