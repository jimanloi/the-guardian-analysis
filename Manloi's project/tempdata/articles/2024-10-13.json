The race began on 12 October and is due to end a week later. Each race day, the waka will lead Team New Zealand out of Barcelona harbour as a \u201cM\u0101ori guard of honour\u201d, says Graham Tipene, coordinator of the waka that is crewed almost entirely by members of the Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua \u014cr\u0101kei iwi (tribe). There will also be a haka performed on the water and some of the crew will go in with the team to perform karakia (prayers and incantations) before they go out to race. \u201cWhat differentiates us from the other teams \u2026 is our deep connection to the ocean and the land and our guardianship of it,\u201d Tipene says. It was Grant Dalton, the doyen of New Zealand sailing and chief executive of Emirates Team New Zealand (ETNZ), who invited the M\u0101ori crew to join them in Barcelona. \u201cWe feel extremely proud to have Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua \u014cr\u0101kei and their waka here in Barcelona,\u201d Dalton says. \u201cWe are a New Zealand team that represents our country, our culture and our innovation with great pride on the world stage, and for us the stage is not any bigger than the America\u2019s Cup. \u201cThe inclusion of the waka at this year\u2019s America\u2019s Cup is a testament to our deep respect for Aotearoa\u2019s roots.\u201d The waka is carved from the trunk of a kauri tree.

You can\u2019t just paddle a waka and not do everything that comes with it.\u201d It comes amid rising tensions within New Zealand over what experts say is a push to roll back M\u0101ori rights. Various New Zealand governments had introduced policies and programs designed to redress the imbalance that sees M\u0101ori people over-represented in negative social metrics. However, the conservative coalition led by Christopher Luxon elected last year, has begun to change and review a series of policies that provide for M\u0101ori, arguing that services should be offered on the basis of need, not race. It has scrapped the M\u0101ori Health Authority and changed the use of M\u0101ori language in government departments. There is also a review of the Treaty of Waitangi, the country\u2019s founding document, which was signed in 1840 by M\u0101ori chiefs and the crown, and upholds M\u0101ori rights. \u201cSome people were feeling pushed aside because M\u0101ori people were getting equal \u2013 not preferential \u2013 treatment,\u201d Tipene says. Yet the culture and the language are thriving and the number of people who identify as M\u0101ori continues to grow, Tipene says, in what he sees as \u201cthe absolute antithesis of what was happening in the seventies and eighties\u201d. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here in Barcelona is part of curbing what the New Zealand government is trying to do and part of the nationhood we should be striving for,\u201d Tipene says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to celebrate M\u0101ori culture, to show the people of Spain and the world who we are and the beauty of who we are.\u201d Meanwhile, there\u2019s a race to be won. Tipene says that in the run-off between the Italian and British boats, he was rooting for the Brits for the chance to face off with the old colonial power. \u201cI really wanted them to win so now it\u2019s up to our team to give their best and remind them that we\u2019re a powerhouse too,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be beautiful.\u201d",

While the AI suggests a number of questions, such as asking the fin whale \u201ctell me about life in the open ocean\u201d, visitors can ask whatever they like. \u201cWhen you talk to these animals, they really come across as personalities, it\u2019s a very strange experience,\u201d Ashby said. \u201cI started by asking things like \u2018where did you live?\u2019 and \u2018how did you die?\u2019, but ended up with far more human questions.\u201d Asked what it used to eat, the museum\u2019s dodo, one of the most complete specimens in the world, described its Mauritian diet of fruits, seeds and the occasional small invertebrate, explaining how its strong, curved beak was perfect for cracking open the tough fruits of the tambalacoque tree. The AI-enhanced exhibit also shared its views on whether humans should attempt to bring the species back through cloning. \u201cEven with advanced techniques, the dodo\u2019s return would require not just our DNA but the delicate ecosystem of Mauritius that supported our kind,\u201d it said. \u201cIt\u2019s a poignant reminder that the true essence of any life goes beyond the genetic code \u2013 it\u2019s intricately woven into its natural habitat.\u201d The fin whale skeleton, which hangs from the museum roof, was granted a similar level of apparent thoughtfulness. Asked about the most famous person it had met, it conceded that while alive it did not have the chance to meet \u201cfamous\u201d individuals as humans see them. \u201cHowever,\u201d the AI-powered skeleton continued, \u201cI like to think that anyone who stands below me and feels awe, reverence and love for the natural world is someone of significance.\u201d",

He brought in reliefs for smaller businesses but retailers have called for wider changes to help them fight off competition from online specialists. Pressure has mounted over the past two years, when an increase in inflation caused business rates to soar while the numbers visiting high streets have yet to recover from the pandemic lockdowns and shift to working from home. The UK\u2019s September inflation figure, which in September 2023 was 6.7% and this year is expected to be about 2%, is used to decide the annual increase in underlying business rates. Official figures will be published on Wednesday. In Labour\u2019s pre-election manifesto, it pledged to replace the business rates system in England with a fairer regime, saying the current arrangement disincentivised investment, created uncertainty and placed an \u201cundue burden on our high streets\u201d. However, it has yet to outline what that new system will look like. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re supporting businesses through pledges to make the business rates system fairer, to cap corporation tax at 25% and to publish a business tax roadmap so that future investments can be planned with confidence.\u201d Last week, more than 70 retailers including Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Ikea wrote to the chancellor calling for a 20% cut to business rates, warning that the property tax could force tens of thousands of shops to shut. In a letter coordinated by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body, executives are pushing for a \u201cretail rates corrector\u201d on the levy, which is charged by local councils and linked to the cost of rent on properties from warehouses and offices to shops. The BRC is not calling for a continuation of the rates relief for smaller businesses, instead arguing that a 20% discount for all retail properties would help \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for the entire sector, which it claims is paying more than its fair share of tax. Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said the government \u201cmust avoid a business rates cliff edge\u201d when the current relief scheme for high street businesses comes to an end. She said: \u201cThe biggest barrier to local investment by any retailer is the broken business rates system, which prevents the creation of new shops and jobs.\u201d A 20% discount would \u201cfix the disproportionate burden on our high streets for good\u201d, she added. BRC research suggests that retailers are paying 7.4% of all business taxes despite accounting for 4.9% of the UK\u2019s total economic output in 2023.",

Spotted handfish are an endangered species of fish that prefer to \u201cwalk\u201d instead of swim, thanks to their unusual pectoral and pelvic fins; have a fluffy dorsal fin on their head that looks almost like a mohawk; and live in the waters off south-east Tasmania. Now CSIRO scientists have sequenced the first full genome of the critically endangered species, a step that could aid monitoring, captive breeding and conservation efforts. Dr Tom Walsh, co-lead of CSIRO\u2019s applied genomics initiative, said the genome was like a \u201cblueprint\u201d for the handfish, providing a better understanding of the species. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is for all our endangered species to only exist as genomes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe conservation has to happen on the ground.

CSIRO scientists have been watching the species since 1997, observing nine localised populations in the Derwent Estuary. The principal investigator Carlie Devine, who specialises in spotted handfish conservation, said the genome\u2019s \u201crich genetic information\u201d would inform long-term management strategy. A multidisciplinary approach \u2013 with genetics alongside ecology \u2013 was \u201cessential for effective conservation of threatened species\u201d, Devine said. Dr Jemina Stuart-Smith, who researches handfish at the University of Tasmania\u2019s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies and was not involved in the genome sequencing work, said it could inform understanding of genetic diversity, as well as captive breeding and translocation. \u201cThis information can also feed into identification of adaptive traits including disease resistance, and can therefore be extremely beneficial in guiding these breeding programs,\u201d she said. Stuart-Smith said many species of handfish were endangered due to their small size, low reproductive capacity, limited range and fragmented populations and habitats. Conservation efforts remained largely focused on two species of handfish, she said: the spotted handfish and the red handfish. Though these species are the most well-studied, Stuart-Smith said many questions about their breeding, biology and general ecology remained. Walsh noted it was still early days but the reference genome data was now available to handfish researchers: \u201cIt really is the plan, the blueprint of the organism that allows all sorts of different work to be done.\u201d",

More recently, Ramsay has been sharply criticised by the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, as <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2024-10-07/debates/B6C03540-3DF0-4CFB-9858-8CD26B53C69F/CarbonCaptureUsageAndStorage\">the pair clashed</a> over Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/04/labour-to-commit-almost-22bn-to-fund-carbon-capture-and-storage-projects\">controversial plans for carbon capture and storage</a> \u2013 \u201ca fig-leaf for fossil fuel\u201d, says Ramsay.</p> <p>\u201cI very much believe in working constructively with any other party or individual MP where I can agree and there\u2019s lots of examples where Greens have worked with others,\u201d he says from his still-spartan Westminster office. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think the public wants politics to work. The prime minister has talked about restoring politics as a public service, and he has a lifetime of public service, so I believe that\u2019s what he wants to do, but yes, it is disappointing when any politician resorts to individual attacks.\u201d</p> <p>Ramsay, 43, might be forgiven if his youthful positivity has diminished after a somewhat bruising first 100 days. Like each one of the record 335 new MPs, his work began the moment he was elected but he had none of the five or six staff required to run an MP\u2019s office.</p> <p>When he was allocated a room, it was situated at the far edge of the parliamentary \u201cring of steel\u201d, accessed through puddle-filled courtyards and, to judge from the poison-bait stations everywhere, a rat-infested building site.</p> <p>Speaking above the clang of scaffolding being erected, Ramsay is not complaining, but the biggest challenge was starting work without staff. \u201cThe job starts straight away and you\u2019re given a budget for your staff team and you need them to do your job well and get back to constituents effectively but you can\u2019t create that out of nowhere,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s been the most frustrating thing for every new MP.\u201d</p>    <p>Deluged with emails, Ramsay has had to prioritise the most urgent constituency cases until finally assembling his full team (four in his Diss constituency office; two in Westminster) shortly before the 100-day mark. \u201cI can talk about all the debates I\u2019ve spoken in, the issues I\u2019ve taken up locally, but I would\u2019ve liked to have operated at fuller capacity earlier on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhirlwind\u201d is his one-word descriptor for his first 100 days and he is delighted to share a Westminster corridor with his three fellow Green MPs. Although the Greens lack a party whip who (sometimes helpfully) tell new MPs what to do, the quartet have been taking advice from their former MP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/03/caroline-lucas-green-party-standing-down-mp-climate-reasons-hopeful\">Caroline Lucas</a>. Some of her former staff, including Ramsay\u2019s press officer, have stayed on to assist.</p> <p>Lucas is a touchstone. \u201cHow did Caroline approach this?\u201d Ramsay asks his press officer as they compose a tweet responding to Starmer highlighting a flood resilience taskforce in PMQs.</p> <p>Lucas, as the lone Green MP, had to build cross-party alliances, and Ramsay is determined to do the same. On Ramsay\u2019s 97th day \u2013 a typical Westminster Wednesday \u2013 he joins a 9am campaign for a <a href=\"https://action.zerohour.uk/\">Climate and Nature Act</a> \u2013 now a private member\u2019s bill introduced by the Lib Dem Roz Savage \u2013 before speaking at a Westminster hall debate celebrating 200 years of the RSPCA. Here he implores the Labour minister Daniel Zeichner to address the \u201cproliferation of huge chicken sheds\u201d that are a big cause of river pollution in his constituency, as well as raising animal welfare concerns.</p> <p>After meetings with his staff and with the fuel poverty charity <a href=\"https://www.nea.org.uk/\">National Energy Action</a>, he attends a private gathering of his fellow Norfolk MPs, including Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems, to discuss special educational needs provision \u2013 a big issue in his early caseload.</p> <p>Unlike Lucas, who had to be the Green parliamentary spokesperson on everything, the Green quartet can share out portfolios. Ramsay is shadowing the Treasury, Department of Health and Social Care, and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). These encompass most of the main issues raised by his constituents, including river pollution, flooding, dental deserts, and the loss of health and bus services. \u201cI\u2019m trying to create as big a synergy as I can between the issues that affect the constituency and the ones I want to have an impact on nationally,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Apart from Lucas, Ramsay\u2019s other inspiration is the former Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, who defied electoral gravity to win and retain North Norfolk for 18 years from 2001. \u201cNorman had a fantastic reputation as a strong local MP and as someone who had a big impact on parliament with his focus on mental health,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was an example of how an MP not from the two big parties can have an impact both in your constituency and nationally.\u201d</p>    <p>Ramsay is determined to show his constituents he is \u201cWaveney Valley\u2019s voice in Westminster, not Westminster\u2019s voice in Waveney Valley\u201d. On day 91 he visits <a href=\"https://waveney.foodbank.org.uk/\">Waveney food bank</a> in the Suffolk town of Eye; <a href=\"https://www.heygirls.co.uk/\">Hey Girls</a>, a vibrant social enterprise and <a href=\"https://myperiod.org.uk/\">charity dedicated to ending period poverty</a>; and a natural flood management scheme provided by the <a href=\"https://www.riverwaveneytrust.org/\">River Waveney Trust</a> charity in the Norfolk village of Gissing.</p> <p>His biggest challenge is likely to be picking a path through the pylon and solar farm debate. Whose side is Ramsay on? \u201cCertainly I want to see more renewables. My career background is leading national charities to accelerate the rollout of renewable energy. It is what will bring down prices and improve resilience. But you\u2019ve still got to have a mature debate about how you do that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He wants the government to ask more of solar farm applications \u2013 that they show how they will be <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/magazine/magazine-articles/agrivoltaic-solar-farm-grows-produce/\">combined with growing food</a> or demonstrate how they will <a href=\"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/scientists-call-on-government-to-change-policies-to-boost-nature-on-uk-solar-farms\">boost biodiversity</a>. \u201cThere needs to be more solar farms in the mix but the government could be more clever rather than giving the impression they\u2019ll just wave through anything that comes along. Yes, we need more solar of all sorts, first of all on rooftops. Why on earth are new houses and commercial buildings going up without solar? We could have far more solar on car parks, and grey sites.\u201d</p> <p>What does he hope to achieve after five years? \u201cI would like my constituents to feel that I\u2019ve stood up for them. And secondly to influence the debate on proper funding and support for restoring nature and restoring health services. If we can push the government in the right direction on those issues, that will be really critical.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us today. This blog is closing soon. Here\u2019s where things stand: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump spent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs with polls showing them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. Kamala Harris held a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, where she attacked her rival Donald Trump for spreading misinformation related to hurricanes Helene and Milton. Meanwhile, Trump delivered his remarks at Prescott Valley, Arizona. A Las Vegas man was arrested for illegally possessing firearms near Trump\u2019s rally. Deputies assigned to Donald Trump\u2019s rally \u201ccontacted\u201d the driver of a black SUV at a checkpoint near the intersection at around 5pm on Saturday, law enforcement said. Speaker Mike Johnson said that passing additional hurricane aid for states impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton \u201ccan wait\u201d until Congress is back in session after the election. Three major polls were released Sunday, showing Kamala Harris either ahead of Donald Trump or running a head-to-head race. Before concluding his speech, Donald Trump criticized critical race theory and made homophobic remarks about gender identity lessons at schools. \u201cOur cities are suffering,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will get critical race theory and transgender insanity out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women\u2019s sports.\u201d He later finished his speech at Prescott Valley, Arizona. Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, Kari Lake, took the stage, calling former president Donald Trump one of the \u201cgreatest leaders in human history\u201d. \u201cI want to go to Washington DC and help President Trump secure our border, make our state safe again, make our state affordable again, and make our kids have access to the American dream,\u201d Lake said before walking off the stage. Trump then expressed his support for several Republican leaders, including Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, Utah congresswoman Celeste Maloy, and Arizona politician Paul Gosar. Donald Trump pivoted to the economy, delivering his usual remarks about Kamala Harris being a \u201ctax queen\u201d, his promise for no tax on tips, and his plans to impose an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on every import coming into the US. The former president later criticized the New York Times for publishing a review of Trump\u2019s rallies and other events that looked at the change since he first took the political stage in 2015, with some attributing his harsher and less-focused performance to his age. Others have accused him of being cognitively impaired. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I will be, someday. We all will be someday, but I\u2019ll be the first to let you know,\u201d Trump said. Donald Trump said agents at the southern border are going \u201cto save our country\u201d, which is why he plans to ask Congress to approve a 10% raise and a $10,000 retention and signing bonus for each agent. \u201cWe\u2019re going to retain them, and they deserve it. They\u2019ve been treated unbelievably badly,\u201d he said. Donald Trump invited National Border Council president, Paul Perez, to the stage. He quickly attacked Trump\u2019s rival, Kamala Harris, and condemned her stance on immigration and her handling of the US-Mexico border. \u201c[Trump] has always stood with the men and women who protect this border, who put their minds on the line for the country, a man who knows about putting his life on the line for what is right,\u201d said Perez. \u201cOn behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Board of Patrol Council, we strongly support Donald J Trump for president of the United States,\u201d Perez said. Donald Trump expressed his support for Kari Lake, the Republican candidate in the Arizona Senate race, calling her a \u201ctough one\u201d. Lake is running against the US Representative Ruben Gallego, with whom she debated on Wednesday. \u201cYou destroyed that poor guy,\u201d Trump said about her performance. \u201cThat was a destruction.\u201d Donald Trump called the mayor of Aurora, Colorado, Mike Coffman, a \u201cradical left Democrat\u201d. During his rally, Trump repeated his comments about Venezuelan gang activity at an apartment complex in the city. Coffman previously said these remarks were \u201cgrossly exaggerated\u201d, adding they \u201chave unfairly hurt the city\u2019s identity and sense of safety\u201d. Donald Trump bragged about his list of endorsements, including SpaceX founder Elon Musk, former US representative Tulsi Gabbard, former third-party candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, and former Trump national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien. He also boasted about the harsh immigration policy undertaken during his presidency. Trump displayed a chart he usually presents during his rallies, showing a decline in people entering the US through the southern border while he was president. He started his remarks by encouraging the crowd to vote \u201cto take back our country\u201d. \u201cWith your help, 23 days from now \u2013 can you believe it? \u2013 we\u2019re going to win Arizona and we\u2019re going to defeat Kamala,\u201d he said. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t even be running.\u201d He proceeded to use degrading language toward immigrants. \u201cWe are here together this Sunday afternoon because we love our country,\u201d Kamala Harris said during her rally in North Carolina. The crowd cheered \u201cUSA, USA, USA!\u201d \u201cI do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America,\u201d Harris said before concluding her speech. Kamala Harris said Donald Trump\u2019s presidency resulted in more than one in three women living in states with abortion bans, including North Carolina. \u201cGeneral Milley, former chairman of the joint chiefs under Donald Trump, said: \u2018No one has ever been as dangerous to this country.\u2019 Think about that,\u201d the vice-president said during her rally. At a campaign stop in Greenville, North Carolina, the Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris attacked her rival Donald Trump for spreading misinformation related to hurricanes Helene and Milton. \u201cWe can already see the harm he\u2019s up to as a candidate,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMost recently, spreading disinformation in the wake of natural disasters.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump cares more about scaring people, creating fear, running on a problem instead of what real leaders do, which is to participate in fixing problems,\u201d Harris added. JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential pick, attended Nascar\u2019s Bank of America Roval 400 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina. Vance attended the playoff race with his family and did not deliver any remarks during the event. Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver his remarks soon at a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona. Before his speech, Trump\u2019s former adviser Stephen Miller took the stage, attacking the Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. \u201cShe not only annihilated our border, but she began using your tax dollars by the billions to smuggle, fly, bus, transport and, in every way possible, relocate illegal aliens en masse inside the United States,\u201d Miller said. He continued to make anti-immigrant comments and condemn the Biden administration\u2019s border policy. Deputies assigned to Donald Trump\u2019s rally \u201ccontacted\u201d the driver of a black SUV at a checkpoint near the intersection at around 5pm on Saturday, law enforcement said. The man was identified as 49-year-old Vem Miller, who was taken into custody and was later released Saturday on $5,000 bail. Miller illegally had a shotgun, a loaded handgun and a high-capacity magazine. The former president held a rally at the Calhoun Ranch in Riverside county, just outside Coachella on Saturday. Paulette Aniskoff, senior adviser for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania and a former Obama aide, told NBC News that she sees \u201csimilarities\u201d between the current Democratic presidential candidate and former president Barack Obama. \u201cThe puzzle is how to make sure that we get enough votes out of everywhere, including the red counties,\u201d said Aniskoff. \u201cWe can\u2019t just run up the score in Philadelphia. That\u2019s the old style of organizing \u2013 to just go into cities and mobilize.\u201d Aniskoff said that her current and former boss share a philosophy of \u201cshowing up everywhere\u201d and listening to voters, including in not-so-friendly sectors. The Guardian\u2019s Lloyd Green reviewed Melania Trump\u2019s new 180-page memoir, which he describes as an \u201cexercise in buck-passing and blame-dodging\u201d. In her new book, the former US first lady \u201cblames staffers for plagiarizing Michelle Obama; repeatedly stresses her love for her husband despite professing to abhor lying liars who lie; and declares abortion a fundamental right, without pausing to consider Donald Trump\u2019s role in attacking it via the US supreme court\u201d. Check out the full review of Melania here: Donald Trump has described an apartment complex in Aurora as a \u201cwar zone\u201d overrun by Venezuelan gangs intent on taking over the city of about 400,000. He repeated the claim at a rally on Friday. Aurora\u2019s mayor, Mike Coffman, said Trump\u2019s claims are \u201cgrossly exaggerated\u201d and that the problems were limited to a handful of apartment complexes and not enveloping the town. \u201cWell, \u2026 the mayor said they were exaggerated. That means there\u2019s got to be some element of truth here,\u201d JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, said during an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cUnfortunately, when you let people in by the millions, most of whom are unvetted, most of whom you don\u2019t know who they really are, you\u2019re going to have problems like this,\u201d Vance added. He also tried to argue that there was no meaningful difference between an entire town and a handful of apartment complexex before This Week host Martha Raddatz ended the interview, saying: \u201cOkay. \u2026 Let\u2019s just end that with they did not invade or take over the city as Donald Trump said.\u201d Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer has apologized for feeding a Doritos chip to a social media influencer who dropped to her knees after Roman Catholic organizations accused the Democratic politician of insulting their religion by mocking the sacrament of communion. \u201cI would never do something to denigrate someone\u2019s faith,\u201d Whitmer said in a statement that her office provided to the Michigan television news station WJBK on Friday. She explained that the stunt in question \u2013 captured on video with popular TikTok content creator Liz Plank \u2013 was meant to promote legislation signed by Joe Biden in 2022 that is colloquially known as the Chips Act and provided $280bn to research as well as manufacture semiconductors. But it was all \u201cconstrued as something it was never intended to be, and I apologize for that\u201d, Whitmer said. On the video, Plank genuflects before Whitmer, who then places a Doritos chip in the podcaster and influencer\u2019s mouth. The governor caps the scene off by gazing at the camera while she wears a hat supporting fellow Democrat Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz in November\u2019s presidential election. The Michigan Catholic Conference \u2013 which has clashed with Whitmer over her support of abortion rights \u2013 joined other church groups in condemning Whitmer\u2019s video with Plank. More on the controversial video here: Donald Trump called those who have opposed or investigated him \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d. \u201cI always say, we have two enemies,\u201d Trump said in an interview on Fox Business\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures. \u201cWe have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within, and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries.\u201d He said that what a president might find hard to handle \u201care these lunatics that we have inside, like Adam Schiff\u201d referring to the California congressman and US Senate candidate who was part of a House committee that investigated the US Capitol attack carried out by Trump\u2019s supporters after he lost the 2020 election to Biden. Tension between Kamala Harris\u2019s team and Joe Biden\u2019s White House has been on the rise in the last weeks before the elections, Axios reported. Senior Biden aides told the news outlet that they\u2019re still hurt over the president being pushed out of his re-election bid. Biden\u2019s aides said they\u2019re adjusting to being in a supporting role on the campaign trail. \u201cThey\u2019re too much in their feelings,\u201d one Harris ally said of Biden\u2019s team. Former President Bill Clinton visited Albany, Georgia, at an event for the Harris-Walz campaign. Clinton arrived at Mount Zion Baptist church and delivered remarks during the Sunday service. \u201cExperts in both parties say that this election is coming down to seven or eight states, one of which is Georgia,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis whole election and the future of the country is turning out to be what people who are sort of on the fence about voting are going to do in the next three and a half weeks.\u201d Early voting in the state starts on Tuesday and will run over the next three weeks. Kamala Harris paid a visit to North Carolina, holding a rally in Greenville at East Carolina University a day after her stop in Raleigh. Over the weekend, she has been meeting with faith leaders and volunteering to help prep supplies for Hurricane Helene victims, which ravaged western North Carolina a few weeks ago. \u201cI know Helene\u2019s impact was further west, but I also know that the people of Greenville, like all Americans, have been inspired by the way communities are coming together,\u201d Harris said on Sunday at the Koinonia Christian Center in Greenville. \u201cIn a moment of crisis, isn\u2019t it something when you know that often it is the people who have the least give the most,\u201d she said. Republican representative Liz Cheney criticized House speaker Mike Johnson for saying there was a peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden after Donald Trump lost in 2020. \u201cI do not have confidence that Mike Johnson will fulfill his constitutional obligations,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cHe has a record repeatedly of doing things that he knows to be wrong, that he knows to be unconstitutional, in order to placate Donald Trump. You saw that sycophancy just now.\u201d Earlier in the show, Johson said: \u201cWe have the peaceful transfer of power.\u201d \u201cI believe President Trump\u2019s going to win, and this will be taken care of,\u201d he added. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump spent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs with polls showing them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. With election day less than a month away, the Democratic vice-president attended a Black church in Greenville, North Carolina, as part of her campaign\u2019s \u201csouls to the polls\u201d push. Her Republican opponent was in Arizona, looking for Black and Latino support as he seeks a second presidency, after a rally in California a day earlier. Both candidates are attempting to get a decisive edge among votes who have not yet decided who to support. Surveys show that early voting, which tends to favor Democrats, is down 45% from previous election years \u2013 a sign that there may be millions of undecided voters. Trump has now switched from condemning early voting as a Democrat plot to engineer his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 to urging people to vote early and by mail. A recent ABC News-Ipsos poll showed that support was split down gender lines, with women voting 60-40 to Harris and men breaking for Trump by a similar margin. Trump needs white women, who supported him in a greater numbers in 2020 than in 2016 \u2013 but also Black men. On Sunday, he argued that his fellow former president Barack Obama\u2019s call last week for Black men to support Harris based \u201csolely on her skin color, rather than her policies\u201d as \u201cdeeply insulting\u201d. Here\u2019s more on the candidates\u2019 campaign events: Donald Trump on Sunday said he does not expect chaos from his supporters on the day of the 5 November election. Asked on Fox News\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures if he anticipated chaos from those who support him over Kamala Harris, the former president said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think. Not from the side that votes for Trump.\u201d Supporters of Trump aimed a deadly attack on Congress weeks after he lost the presidency to Joe Biden in 2020. The US Capitol attack \u2013 launched after he told his supporters to fight like hell \u2013 was a desperate attempt to prevent congressional certification of the US president\u2019s victory. Hundreds of participants have been indicted on federal crimes pertaining to the violence. And Trump himself was criminally charged with illicitly trying to overturn his 2020 defeat in the lead-up to the attack, including by lying about how fraudsters robbed him of winning against Biden. Homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday said the slew of misinformation online about the hurricanes devastating parts of the US is \u201cextremely pernicious\u201d. During an interview with Face the Nation, Mayorkas called for officials to debunk the false claims because \u201cwe\u2019re not seeing enough of that.\u201d The Democratic National Committee released a six-figure ad campaign in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania calling out Jill Stein as a \u201cvote for Trump\u201d. The ad opens with a photo of Stein morphing into the Republican presidential nominee. \u201cWhy are Trump\u2019s close allies helping her? Stein was key to Trump\u2019s 2016 wins in battleground states,\u201d says the ad. \u201cShe\u2019s not sorry she helped Trump win. That\u2019s why a vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump.\u201d Democratic party chair Jaime Harrison, California Senate candidate Adam Schiff, activist Jessica Craven, and others reacted to the ad on social. Media blitz to VP duties: on the campaign trail with Kamala Harris The View, America\u2019s most popular daytime talkshow, was on commercial break. Kamala Harris sat writing absence notes for students who were missing class to attend the live broadcast. \u201cIs it just today, right?\u201d the vice-president laughed. She handed over the letters written on notepaper headed \u201cThe Vice President\u201d. One said: \u201cDear teacher, please excuse Dani from class today. She was hanging out with us. Best and thank you for being an educator. Kamala.\u201d It was an unscripted moment that the studio audience loved but TV viewers wouldn\u2019t see. Harris, running the shortest presidential campaign in modern US history after being unexpectedly plunged into the fight when Joe Biden dropped out, is exploring ways to reveal herself to a wary nation. Still a relatively unknown quantity, the former California attorney general and US senator is trying to make the electorate feel comfortable about the prospect of President Kamala Harris. In less than three months the vice-president has raised a record-breaking billion dollars. She has tried to put daylight between herself and the unpopular incumbent figure of Biden, and turn the election into a referendum on her opponent, former US president Donald Trump. She has sought to bring positive vibes to a country that seems to have anxiety in its bones. She has set out to persuade America to do something that it has never done before in its 248-year existence: elect a woman to the White House \u2013 and a woman of colour to boot. Here\u2019s more on Harris\u2019s media blitz: Republican\u2019s lies about immigrants eating cats in Ohio has led to swell of far-right extremism in Springfield \u2013 and beyond For Denise Williams, the 70-year-old head of Springfield\u2019s NAACP chapter, the past several weeks have been testing to say the least. Last month, flyers calling for mass deportations of immigrants were distributed by the so-called Trinity White Knights, a group associated with the Ku Klux Klan, in Black-majority neighborhoods in south Springfield. \u201cI\u2019m telling people: do nothing \u2013 don\u2019t approach them. But it\u2019s not easy for people to see this,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is what a lot of folks cannot understand \u2013 why do we have so much hate?\u201d About 22% of Springfield residents are African American, according to the US Census Bureau. \u201cPeople are mad. African Americans here don\u2019t understand how this is allowed. We just have to take this for a minute. I know it\u2019s hard.\u201d Trinity White Knights is headquartered in Kentucky, where flyers were also seen by residents of the Cincinnati suburb of Covington in July as part of an apparent recruitment effort. The flyers included a PO box address in Maysville, Kentucky, and a phone number. Ever since Donald Trump claimed during a 10 September televised debate watched by 67 million people that immigrants in Springfield were eating people\u2019s pets \u2013 a claim that has been found to be baseless \u2013 Springfield has seen a groundswell in far-right extremism. Here\u2019s more context on the rise in far-right extremism: Three major polls were released Sunday, showing Vice-President Kamala Harris either ahead of former president Donald Trump or running a head-to-head race. Let\u2019s start with the ABC News/Ipsos poll: Harris is ahead by two percentage points with 50% of the support. The poll, conducted between 4 to 8 October, found that 56% of Americans favor deporting all undocumented immigrants, helping Trump\u2019s lead in trust to handle immigration at the US-Mexico border. Meanwhile, NBC\u2019s poll, conducted during the same time, shows Harris with support from 48% of registered voters, while Trump has the same percentage of support. Another 4% say they are undecided or wouldn\u2019t vote for either option. CBS also conducted a poll earlier this month, revealing a lead by Harris with 51% support compared to Trump\u2019s 48%. The economy and policy surrounding the US-Mexico border are among the top issues voters are placing as top priorities when deciding on the next president. Speaker Mike Johnson said that passing additional hurricane aid for states impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton \u201ccan wait\u201d until Congress is back in session after the election. On Sunday, Johnson CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where host Margaret Brennan asked him why he thinks it\u2019s fine to wait until November for Congress to pass more aid for Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton victims. \u201cWell, it can wait because, remember, the day before Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida and then went up through the states and wound up in Senator Tillis\u2019s state of North Carolina, Congress appropriated 20 billion additional dollars to FEMA so that they would have the necessary resources to address immediate needs,\u201d Johnson said. Tillis was part of a bipartisan group of senators that signed a letter urging lawmakers to think about bringing Congress members back into session this month to pass disaster legislation before the year\u2019s end. Democratic senator Raphael Warnock from Georgia said he does not believe Black men will show up for former President Trump in large numbers. During CNN\u2019s State of the Union with Dana Bash, Warnock said: Black men are not going to vote for Donald Trump in any significant numbers. There will be some. We\u2019re not a monolith. He was responding to a New York Times polling that placed Kamala Harris behind Joe Biden among Black voters. Warnock alluded to the late 80s case of the Central Park Five, where the brutal assault of a New York jogger in Central Park led to Trump taking out full-page ads in the city\u2019s major newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty for those responsible. \u201cWhen it was proven that the Exonerated 5, the Central Park 5, were actually innocent, Donald Trump has shown no deal of concern about what they went through, no deal, no bit of contrition about it,\u201d Warnock said. Good morning, US politics blog readers. There\u2019s another busy news day ahead of us and we\u2019ll keep up with all the developments as they happen. Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, later today. Kamala Harris\u2019s husband, Doug Emhoff, will head to a Get Out the Jewish Vote campaign event in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He will later deliver remarks at a Girl Dads for Harris-Walz phone bank in Delaware County. Several polls released on Sunday show Vice-President Kamala Harris in the lead or in a tight race with former president Donald Trump. An ABC News/Ipsos poll shows 50% support for Harris and 48% for Trump, while the latest national NBC News poll shows Trump and Harris are deadlocked. Here\u2019s what else is happening: Kamala Harris on Saturday released a report on her health and medical history, which found that \u201cshe possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency\u201d if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president\u2019s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions about Donald Trump\u2019s physical fitness and mental acuity. Tightening poll figures have triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase, according to The Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker. Several former Trump administration officials have warned that the former president deliberately withheld disaster aid to states he deemed politically hostile to him as US president and will do so again unimpeded if he returns to the White House.",

The interim manager has held the same caretaker position previously at Coventry, Brentford and Birmingham and admits that he spent so much energy thinking about what might happen to him in the longer term at those clubs that he forgot to do the job in hand. Carsley spoke after his England team had won 3-1 in the Nations League against Finland in Helsinki, a riposte of sorts after the chaotic 2-1 Wembley defeat against Greece last Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m definitely reluctant because in the past when I have done this caretaker or interim role, I have gone so far down the \u2018I don\u2019t want the job [or otherwise]\u2019, I\u2019ve actually not done the job,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that I keep an open mind because in that case I\u2019m not being reckless with my decisions [in terms of the team].

She later exalted the way communities \u2013 especially in the western part of the state \u2013 were coming together after damage from Hurricane Helene in late September, especially the way \u201cpeople who have the least give the most\u201d.</p> <p>Her Republican opponent, meanwhile, was in Arizona \u2013 looking for Black and Latino support as he seeks a second presidency, after a rally in California a day earlier.</p> <p>Both candidates are attempting to get a decisive edge among votes who have not yet decided who to support. Surveys show that early voting, which tends to favor Democrats, is down 45% from previous election years \u2013 a sign that there may be millions of undecided voters.</p> <p>Trump has now switched from condemning early voting as a Democratic plot to engineer his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 to urging people to vote early and by mail.</p> <p>A recent ABC News-Ipsos <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/harris-trump-abc-news-ipsos-poll-convention-bounce-widens-gap-women/story?id=113246534\">poll</a> showed that support was split down gender lines, with women voting 60-40 for Harris and men breaking for Trump by a similar margin. </p> <p>Trump needs white women, who supported him in a greater numbers in 2020 than in 2016 \u2013 but also Black men. On Sunday, he argued that his fellow former president Barack Obama\u2019s call last week for Black men to support Harris based \u201csolely on her skin color, rather than her policies\u201d as \u201cdeeply insulting\u201d.</p>    <p>The Democratic Georgia senator Ralph Warnock on Sunday told CNN: \u201cBlack men are not going to vote for Donald Trump in any significant numbers.\u201d But his fellow Black Democrat Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina congressman, told CNN: \u201cYes, I am concerned\u201d about Black men voting for Trump. Separately, the former president Bill Clinton was urging voters in rural Georgia to get behind the Democratic ticket.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-hispanic-likely-electorate.html\">A New York Times poll published</a> on Sunday found that Harris was underperforming the last three Democratic candidates for the White House among Latino voters.</p> <p>The election may come down to fractional increases in support for each. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/dead-heat-trump-pulls-even-harris-nbc-news-poll-rcna174201\">An NBC News poll</a> released on Sunday showed the candidates in a \u201cdead heat\u201d nationally at 48% support. The poll found that voters are reassessing Trump\u2019s first term more favorably \u2013 but also that voters view reproductive rights as a top motivating issue, which could hurt the former president after three of his US supreme court appointees eliminated the federal right to abortion.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-harris-poll-how-information-beliefs-shape-tight-2024-campaign/\">A CBS News poll</a>, also released on Sunday, found that the presidential race is more than just two conflicting ideologies \u2013 but about a fundamental disconnection.</p> <p>For instance, most Trump supporters said relief for victims of Hurricanes Helene and Milton wasn\u2019t reaching affected people \u2013 while Harris supporters indicated it was.

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump spent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs with polls showing them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. With election day less than a month away, the Democratic vice-president attended a Black church in Greenville, North Carolina, as part of her campaign\u2019s \u201csouls to the polls\u201d push. She later exalted the way communities \u2013 especially in the western part of the state \u2013 were coming together after damage from Hurricane Helene in late September, especially the way \u201cpeople who have the least give the most\u201d. Her Republican opponent, meanwhile, was in Arizona \u2013 looking for Black and Latino support as he seeks a second presidency, after a rally in California a day earlier. Both candidates are attempting to get a decisive edge among votes who have not yet decided who to support. Surveys show that early voting, which tends to favor Democrats, is down 45% from previous election years \u2013 a sign that there may be millions of undecided voters. Trump has now switched from condemning early voting as a Democratic plot to engineer his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 to urging people to vote early and by mail. A recent ABC News-Ipsos poll showed that support was split down gender lines, with women voting 60-40 for Harris and men breaking for Trump by a similar margin. Trump needs white women, who supported him in a greater numbers in 2020 than in 2016 \u2013 but also Black men. On Sunday, he argued that his fellow former president Barack Obama\u2019s call last week for Black men to support Harris based \u201csolely on her skin color, rather than her policies\u201d as \u201cdeeply insulting\u201d. The Democratic Georgia senator Ralph Warnock on Sunday told CNN: \u201cBlack men are not going to vote for Donald Trump in any significant numbers.\u201d But his fellow Black Democrat Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina congressman, told CNN: \u201cYes, I am concerned\u201d about Black men voting for Trump. Separately, the former president Bill Clinton was urging voters in rural Georgia to get behind the Democratic ticket. A New York Times poll published on Sunday found that Harris was underperforming the last three Democratic candidates for the White House among Latino voters. The election may come down to fractional increases in support for each. An NBC News poll released on Sunday showed the candidates in a \u201cdead heat\u201d nationally at 48% support. The poll found that voters are reassessing Trump\u2019s first term more favorably \u2013 but also that voters view reproductive rights as a top motivating issue, which could hurt the former president after three of his US supreme court appointees eliminated the federal right to abortion. A CBS News poll, also released on Sunday, found that the presidential race is more than just two conflicting ideologies \u2013 but about a fundamental disconnection. For instance, most Trump supporters said relief for victims of Hurricanes Helene and Milton wasn\u2019t reaching affected people \u2013 while Harris supporters indicated it was. Trump supporters said the economy was bad; Harris supporters said it was good. Trump\u2019s voters said US-Mexico border crossings were increasing; Harris\u2019s voters said they were down. Trump\u2019s voters, especially the men, said gender equality efforts had gone too far; Harris voters said not far enough. But both agreed that social media was untrustworthy and had made it harder to find things to agree on and to tell fact from fiction. Each poll contained positive signs for Harris, including a five-point advantage on \u201clooking out for middle class\u201d (ABC); abortion being \u201c#1 motivating issue\u201d (NBC), with Democrat up 19 points on the issue over Trump (New York Times); Trump\u2019s Latino support at the same level from 2020 (CBS), and also Harris matching Biden in 2020 with Black voters. But the response to the two hurricanes that the south-eastern US recently continued to dominate Democrats\u2019 campaign. On Sunday, Biden was scheduled to survey damage inflicted on Florida\u2019s Gulf coast by Milton, where he would announce $600m in funding for damaged electrical grids. Response to hurricanes remains Democrats\u2019 political preoccupation. Harris\u2019s rally on Sunday came amid the intense politicization of the speed of federal disaster response to Helene. In North Carolina, Harris appeared to be looking to defuse hurricane politics while also calling out false information that spread after Helene. Crises, she said, \u201chave a way of revealing the heroes among us, the angels among us, and of showing us all the best of who we are ... heroes who do not ask the injured or stranded whether they are a Republican or a Democrat, but who simply ask: \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\u201d And yet, Harris said: \u201cThere are some who are not acting in the spirit of community, and I am speaking of these who have been literally not telling the truth, lying about people who are working hard to help the folks in need, spreading disinformation when the truth and facts are required.\u201d That came as the Wall Street Journal reported that some of the earlier response to Helene had come in the form of Patriot Front, an organization that the Anti-Defamation League has concluded is a white-supremacist group \u2013 and that was using misinformation as a recruiting tool. With Arizona, Nevada and Georgia potentially leaning for Trump, and Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin potentially leaning for Harris, the loss of North Carolina would cost Trump 16 electoral college votes needed to reach the winning threshold of 270. The state narrowly voted for Trump in 2020. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday that he would deny Harris and Biden\u2019s call to bring Congress back to Washington to approve more disaster relief funding after the hurricane. \u201cIt can wait,\u201d Johnson said, pointing to $20bn in additional disaster funding that had recently been approved. He claimed only 2% of that funding had been distributed. As soon as states have assessed and calculate their \u201cactual needs\u201d, and submitted them, \u201cCongress will meet and in bipartisan fashion, we will address those needs.\u201d Johnson accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) of being \u201cslow to respond\u201d. He said: \u201cThey did not do the job that we all expect and hope that they will do, and there\u2019s going to be a lot of assessment about that as well in the days ahead.\u201d But with Harris\u2019s support appearing to slip in recent weeks, including after a series of TV appearances, there are reports of growing tensions between her campaign and Biden\u2019s White House. The president cancelled a trip to Germany to concentrate on the hurricane response. But he is now reported to have rescheduled the trip for Friday. According to Axios, Biden aides remain wounded by the president being pushed out of his re-election bid amid questions about his age. He is 81 \u2013 only three years older than Trump. Harris\u2019s team believed Biden upstaged her by holding an impromptu press briefing while she held a rally in Michigan. Biden on Sunday was expected to meet with Florida governor Ron DeSantis, with whom Harris was feuding earlier in the week. An aide to Harris, 59, told the outlet that the president\u2019s team are \u201ctoo much in their feelings\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. In a rallying cry for unity one year on from the bruising experience of referendum rejection, key proponents of the Indigenous voice to parliament have challenged Australians to come together to forge a more \u201cauthentic Australia\u201d. We also report this morning that Queensland\u2019s premier, Steven Miles, has promised to hold a plebiscite on nuclear power if he wins the upcoming state election. Business leaders are laying the blame for Australia\u2019s housing supply crisis on local government delays on application decisions. And UN peacekeepers say Israeli tanks forcibly entered their base in southern Lebanon in a \u201cshocking violation\u201d. Australia Exclusive | Steven Miles will hold a plebiscite on Peter Dutton\u2019s nuclear power plans if he wins the 26 October Queenslans poll, a move that could polarise the electorate at the next federal election. A year later | Pat Anderson, a prominent backer of the Indigenous voice to parliament, has challenged Australians to be \u201cbigger and wider \u2013 to be grand\u201d a year after the referendum\u2019s defeat. Housing crisis | The Business Council of Australia has blamed slow local council decision-making for worsening the housing supply crisis, saying delays are making developers reluctant to invest. Greyhound racing | As more cases of greyhounds being unnecessarily euthanised are revealed, activists want stricter reporting requirements for the racing industry in Victoria. The Agenda | Australia\u2019s proposed world-leading tax transparency scheme faces trouble in parliament, where the Coalition want to water it down and the Greens want to toughen in up, Paul Karp writes. World Middle East crisis | The UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has said two Israeli tanks destroyed a gate and forcibly entered their base; the US will send antimissile system and military personnel to Israel; Palestinians fear being forgotten as world\u2019s focus shifts to Lebanon. US politics | Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, locked in tight race, seek an edge among undecided voters; Democrats are nervous in critical Michigan amid fears of waning enthusiasm for Harris. We have liftoff | SpaceX launched its enormous Starship rocket yesterday on its boldest test flight yet, catching the returning booster back at the pad with mechanical arms in a \u201cchopsticks\u201d manoeuvre. \u2018Massive accusations\u2019 | Limp Bizkt say they \u2013 and probably many other musicians \u2013 are owed hundreds of millions of dollars from resurgent interest on streaming platforms that was allegedly pocketed by music companies. Snap election called | Iceland\u2019s three-party coalition government, in power since November 2021, has collapsed due to disagreements on policy issues \u2013 with new elections to be held in November. Full Story The next generation fighting for an Indigenous voice A year ago on 14 October, as the results of Australia\u2019s 2023 Indigenous voice to parliament referendum rolled in, many people were left devastated. One year on from the referendum, the Uluru youth dialogue co-chairs Allira Davis and Bridget Cama tell Reged Ahmad why they haven\u2019t given up on constitutional recognition for First Nations Australians. In-depth The voice was never going to be a magic bullet, no matter how much the Albanese government attempted to sell it as such, Celeste Liddle writes. But the reality was that what was on the table was a smidgen better than nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to revisit the fallout of the voice referendum,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut I do want to look at how Australia can move forward: we cannot maintain the status quo.\u201d Not the news This month then comedian Geraldine Hickey went looking for tawny frogmouths, a charismatic bird with a frog-like beak and mottled feathers. While she forgot her binoculars and didn\u2019t know she was in the right spot, after a couple of minutes she spotted one. And then another. \u201cI just felt like a bird god,\u201d she says. This week Hickey is among thousands of Australians taking up the opportunity to try 20 minutes of birdwatching as part of BirdLife Australia\u2019s annual Aussie Bird Count. The world of sport Cricket | Australia have beaten India by nine runs after an action-packed final over to book their spot in the 2024 Women\u2019s T20 World Cup semi-finals. Football | Rising sons, shifting shadows: how Japan\u2019s football systems left Australia in the shade. Running | The Kenyan runner Ruth Chepngetich has smashed the marathon world record by nearly two minutes in Chicago. Sailing | New Zealand have taken a 3-0 America\u2019s Cup lead in the first-to-seven series after Britain were hit with a penalty. Media roundup The Victorian government\u2019s compensation offer to former foster care children has been described as an \u201cinsult\u201d to victims, ABC News reports. Australia\u2019s first defence intelligence chief has been appointed as the next Australian Border Force commissioner, the Australian reports.

Instead, he was undone by the Charleston, which isn\u2019t the dance you want when you\u2019ve got a sore leg. This year\u2019s oldest male celebrity at 62 is a strapping fellow, so bouncing and swivelling on a crocked joint can\u2019t have been easy, let alone twice. He\u2019s been spotted out and about in a knee brace, so it\u2019s clearly giving him grief.</p> <p>Still, at least he got to belatedly perform the Paddington dance dedicated to his 10-year-old son Eddie. As judge <strong>Motsi Mabuse</strong> said last night, most celebrities who miss a show through injury never return. Nick bowed out in the ballroom, rather than leaving off-screen with a whimper.</p> <p>The craggy-faced handyman was game enough but something of a dad dancer. The three routines he got to complete - a hi-vis jive, a one-armed American smooth and that Paddington plod - never scored more than 21 points. Once he was drawn against <strong>Shayne Ward</strong> in the dance-off, the writing was on the hastily erected MDF wall.</p> <p>However, when he wasn\u2019t on the physio\u2019s table, he clearly enjoyed his month in the sparkly Strictly bubble. Rest up, get fit and go well, Knowlesy.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-13T19:35:04.580Z\">at 8.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-670c19868f087ed1d5a8ab22\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-13T19:04:51.548Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sighs of relief from half the field</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Perhaps the most fortunate celebrity tonight is<strong> Dr Punam Krishan</strong>. After her error-strewn jive, she finished bottom of the scoreboard, a point below <strong>Nick Knowles</strong>. Considering she scored 10 fewer than<strong> Shanye Ward</strong>, she can count herself lucky. </p> <p>The media medic was saved from the dance-off by viewer votes - a hangover, perhaps, from that milestone Bollywood moment last week. That was the only time she\u2019s escaped the lower reaches of the leaderboard. The jiving GP needs to raise her game if she\u2019s going to make it into November.</p> <p>Indeed, all the hoofers who scored fewer points than Shayne will be breathing a sigh of relief. <strong>Paul Merson</strong> and <strong>Pete Wicks </strong>especially, but also<strong> Sam Quek</strong> and <strong>Sarah Hadland</strong>, who has previously looked like a potential finalist but had a poor night. Bear with, bear with.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670c19158f081a18004e5e2b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-13T19:03:29.509Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Shayne Ward news was a shocker</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nick\u2019s exit was no great surprise. What will raise plentiful eyebrows was the unexpected appearance of <strong>Shayne Ward</strong> in the dance-off. He finished joint fifth on the judges\u2019 scoreboard, a hefty 10 points off the bottom. Six celebrities scored fewer. However, Shayne failed to win enough public votes and plummeted into the bottom two.</p> <p>Was it the fabled \u201ccurse of the middle of the leaderboard\u201d, with everyone assuming he was safe? Was it because he danced first on Saturday, the so-called \u201cslot of death\u201d, meaning his routine got forgotten when it came to voting time? Or is he not connecting with viewers? Some have found his uneasy combination of cockiness and fragility hard to warm to.</p> <p>Then again, perhaps nobody could bring themselves to vote for those ghastly custard yellow get-ups. That will teach <strong>Vicky Gill\u2019</strong>s wardrobe department for using up spare fabric from the Minions routine in Movie Week.

It\u2019s fast and full-on with \u201cmore bloody lifts than Canary Wharf\u201d, according to Chris. Tricks and hip action. Speed, lots of steps and cracking lifts.

No props, fancy dress or comedy factor this time. Paul Merson is trying to keep a straight face for a sophisticated Fred Astaire number. Looking debonair in a tailsuit with top hat and cane. Very gentlemanly. With the axe hovering over him, he\u2019ll need to show improved technique and timing if he\u2019s going to escape another dance-off.

A fun disco number and a decent semi-moonwalk to end. </p> <p><strong>Song:</strong> Ain\u2019t No Love (Ain\u2019t No Use) by Sub Sub feat Melanie Williams. This 1993 dance banger sampled Good Morning Starshine from Hair, which a band member owned on vinyl because he won it at a fair in his teens.

      "bodyText": "Just popping back briefly to highlight this superlative comment from MikeMoonlight: \u201cPete Wicks is dancing to Oasis next week? He\u2019ll get a score of 22 from the judges on Saturday but owing to dynamic scoring, that\u2019ll rise to a perfect 40 by Sunday.\u201d Thanks for watching along with me and making this one of the happiest corners of the internet each weekend. Our dancefloor dozen now progress to the fifth live show, which airs next Saturday at 6.25pm on BBC1. Meet you back here for cha-cha-chat. In the meantime, let muscle memory kick in and keeeeep dancing! Goodnight and have a great week. Finally, on the Wynne Evans and Katya Jones farrago, Pancake01 says: \u201cI think something must have happened. Wynne standing with his hands behind his back, like he\u2019s been told to.\u201d Nottinghamfella adds: \u201cI know Katya &amp; Wynne put a statement out but there is a definite edge here. It\u2019s like he daren\u2019t go near her. Even when their names were announced, he kept his hands behind his back and barely looked at her. It seems neither of them are really sure what to do.\u201d On that Taylor Swift group number, SparklingDormouse says: \u201cBah humbug. Professional dance &amp; special effects. Boo!Didn\u2019t like the darkness. What\u2019s the point of having all those dancers when you can\u2019t see them? AND the freezing thing. Very annoying.\u201d Paperview adds: \u201cMandy Moore is an amazing choreographer. I love her work. But that professionals\u2019 dance was the equivalent of an idea scribbled on a scrap of paper and left, forgotten in a drawer until someone called for a last-minute idea. It should have stayed in the drawer.\u201d On Paul Merson going through, Phoebe says: \u201cI loved the delayed joy from Karen and Paul after they were declared to be through to next week. They were genuinely shocked. Glad Paul is through as he seems to have got over the \u2018embarrassment\u2019 of dancing and realised that he CAN do it and is now enjoying it. A proper Strictly journey.\u201d On Snow Patrol\u2019s performance, JoMK73 says: \u201cOutstanding dance from Lauren and Kai. Lauren really is incredible and they make a nice partnership.\u201d tomatopincushion adds: \u201cLove Snow Patrol but I\u2019m not OK with them looking older. In my head, they only exist as they did when I was 16, listening to them while revising for GCSEs. Twenty years ago. Bah.\u201d On Shayne Ward\u2019s shock appearance in the dance-off, Emilyscatnaps says: \u201cOoooh, the curse of going first for Shayne?\u201d tomatopincushion says: \u201cOh Shayne. Not a huge surprise, he\u2019s pretty forgettable.\u201d IvanTiger adds: \u201cShayne?? Must be his yellow cozzie as his dancing was good.\u201d Time for a (Taylor) swift round-up of your comments. On Nick and Luba\u2019s departure, wtrukus says: \u201cThey deserve to be in the dance off but also when a celebrity wears bear ears, you know they\u2019re going out.\u201d IvanTiger says: \u201cNick\u2019s no surprise. He\u2019ll be able to go home to bed and recover now.\u201d Emilyscatnaps says: \u201cI think Shayne\u2019s leg action is better \u2018tonight\u2019. Bodes badly for the little bear with the hard stare.\u201d YodaknowsAll says: \u201cMotsi \u2018I am voting for Shane and Nancy as they were on a whole other level\u2019. Talk about kicking a man when he\u2019s down.\u201d geordiehinney22 adds: \u201cDear Luba is such a competent person, game for anything, especially on ITT. She\u2019s the one you\u2019d want on your desert island. How I wish she could get a decent dance partner.\u201d It\u2019s been another all-too-brief contest for long-suffering Luba Mushtuk. The St Petersburg-born pro tends to be paired with tall but relatively unpromising celebrities. This was the third time she\u2019s failed to last a month, having been booted out early with rower James Cracknell and NFL player Jason Bell. She was then benched for two years, before reaching mid-series last year with actor Adam Thomas. That remains her best run in seven years on the show. Now she had to choreograph not one but two numbers around Nick Knowles\u2019 various ailments. She\u2019ll be praying for another soap actor or similar next year. Preferably one with a clean bill of health. TV viewers can now flip to Nothing Like A Dame on BBC2, The Dog House on Channel 4 or Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? on ITV1. At 9pm, there\u2019s new Welsh noir Cleddau (which translates as The One That Got Away) on S4C/BBC iPlayer, legal drama Showtrial on BBC1 or The Poisoning: How To Kill Your Husband on C5. Don\u2019t go getting any ideas, mind you. Film-wise, 12 Angry Men is just starting on Sky Arts. The Lady In The Van airs at 10.30pm on BBC1. At 11.55pm, get in the Halloween mood with The Wicker Man on BBC2. Oh no! Oh Jesus Christ! If it wasn\u2019t for his unlucky run of injuries - first to his arm, then his knee - DIY SOS host Nick Knowles might have lasted a few more weeks. Instead, he was undone by the Charleston, which isn\u2019t the dance you want when you\u2019ve got a sore leg. This year\u2019s oldest male celebrity at 62 is a strapping fellow, so bouncing and swivelling on a crocked joint can\u2019t have been easy, let alone twice. He\u2019s been spotted out and about in a knee brace, so it\u2019s clearly giving him grief. Still, at least he got to belatedly perform the Paddington dance dedicated to his 10-year-old son Eddie. As judge Motsi Mabuse said last night, most celebrities who miss a show through injury never return. Nick bowed out in the ballroom, rather than leaving off-screen with a whimper. The craggy-faced handyman was game enough but something of a dad dancer. The three routines he got to complete - a hi-vis jive, a one-armed American smooth and that Paddington plod - never scored more than 21 points. Once he was drawn against Shayne Ward in the dance-off, the writing was on the hastily erected MDF wall. However, when he wasn\u2019t on the physio\u2019s table, he clearly enjoyed his month in the sparkly Strictly bubble. Rest up, get fit and go well, Knowlesy. Perhaps the most fortunate celebrity tonight is Dr Punam Krishan. After her error-strewn jive, she finished bottom of the scoreboard, a point below Nick Knowles. Considering she scored 10 fewer than Shanye Ward, she can count herself lucky. The media medic was saved from the dance-off by viewer votes - a hangover, perhaps, from that milestone Bollywood moment last week. That was the only time she\u2019s escaped the lower reaches of the leaderboard. The jiving GP needs to raise her game if she\u2019s going to make it into November. Indeed, all the hoofers who scored fewer points than Shayne will be breathing a sigh of relief. Paul Merson and Pete Wicks especially, but also Sam Quek and Sarah Hadland, who has previously looked like a potential finalist but had a poor night. Bear with, bear with. Nick\u2019s exit was no great surprise. What will raise plentiful eyebrows was the unexpected appearance of Shayne Ward in the dance-off. He finished joint fifth on the judges\u2019 scoreboard, a hefty 10 points off the bottom. Six celebrities scored fewer. However, Shayne failed to win enough public votes and plummeted into the bottom two. Was it the fabled \u201ccurse of the middle of the leaderboard\u201d, with everyone assuming he was safe? Was it because he danced first on Saturday, the so-called \u201cslot of death\u201d, meaning his routine got forgotten when it came to voting time? Or is he not connecting with viewers? Some have found his uneasy combination of cockiness and fragility hard to warm to. Then again, perhaps nobody could bring themselves to vote for those ghastly custard yellow get-ups. That will teach Vicky Gill\u2019s wardrobe department for using up spare fabric from the Minions routine in Movie Week. Despicable corner-cutting. As the departing couple take a final twirl around the ballroom to I Try by Macy Gray (tune), the credits roll and the other couples crowd in for backslaps and air-kisses. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Her voice cracking with emotion, his pro partner Luba Mushtuk says: \u201cI\u2019ve never met someone as determined as you. I remember you saying that if you do your best, you\u2019ll be very happy. I think you did more than your best. Thank you.\u201d In his exit interview, Nick Knowles tells Tess: \u201cI\u2019ve been surprised by how much I\u2019ve loved doing this and by two things that happen. One is how much you care each week. The other is how much you don\u2019t want to let down your partner. The only reason I could do this is simply because of Luba\u2019s changes, she\u2019s been amazing. \u201cI should say thank you also to all the background staff, the physios, all the people that have actually got me through this week, and to all of my fellow competitors who have been absolutely astounding. Beautiful people. There are some amazing dancers up there and I will love watching the rest of the series.\u201d Nicely said. Feel free to watch along with the Guardian\u2019s liveblog, Nick. I hear it\u2019s quite good. No surprisingly, it\u2019s unanimous. Head judge Shirley also would\u2019ve chosen to save Shayne and Nancy, saying \u201cboth pairs upped their game\u201d. The majority vote means that Nick Knowles and Luba Mushtuk become this year\u2019s third couple to depart the dancefloor. Shayne and Nancy, saying \u201cboth couples improved but they had greater clarity of technique\u201d. Shayne and Nancy, saying \u201cthey were at a different level\u201d. Shayne and Nancy, saying \u201cthey kept time and it was clean, even though Nick improved\u201d. The judges each scored Shayne two points more than Nick last night - except Craig, who saw a three-point difference. Surely Nick didn\u2019t do enough to close such a yawning gap? Nick Knowles and his dance partner Luba Mushtuk reprise their prison-set Charleston to Rain on the Roof from Paddington 2. Channelling Hugh Grant and a Peruvian bear with Ben Whishaw\u2019s voice. The judges said last night that it was slow-paced and too placed, lacking swivel and a sense of wild abandon. It notched 21 points, a huge nine fewer than Shayne, so Nick will need to show miraculous improvement. Shayne Ward and his pro partner Nancy Xu have another go at their bowling alley-themed cha cha cha to Ain\u2019t No Love (Ain\u2019t No Use) by Sub Sub feat Melanie Williams. The judge said last night that it had good groove and strong connection but Shayne needed to work on his arm co-ordination. It scored 30 points, nine more than Nick, so surely all Shayne needs to do is not go A over T and he should be fine. And hey, at least it gives us another chance to enjoy this 90s dance banger. Musical interlude now from Celtic indie rockers Snow Patrol, performing their latest single Everything\u2019s Here and Nothing\u2019s Lost. Kai Widdrington and Lauren Oakey provide choreographic accompaniment. He\u2019s brought in some fruit. Not the promised pears, though. More Clauditorium chat with the relieved couples. La Winkle\u2019s an Oasis superfan, so is mad for it. Dr Punam is relieved and grateful to go through. Sam Quek is missing a friend\u2019s wedding because she\u2019s still in the contest against all expectations. Nikita Kuzmin has another go at singing next week\u2019s song. That was a lot. Sarah Hadland\u2019s cat Percy makes his weekly cameo. Well, he was second from bottom on the scoreboard and hasn\u2019t been saved by viewer votes. Nick Knowles and Luba Mushtuk are consigned to the dance-off for the first time. Is his injured knee up to a second performance? And has he got a hope in hell against Shayne Ward? So are Pete Wicks, Sam Quek, Dr Punam Krishan and Sarah Hadland. Now to find out who will face Shayne in the dance-off. Fasten your lurid yellow leisurewear. Shirley sings the praises of Chris McCausland. Rightly so. Craig Revel Horwood demonstrates figure-of-eight hip action. Even Shirley Ballas, the trademarked Queen Of Latin, is impressed. They\u2019re shocked that Shanye Ward\u2019s in the dance-off, like many of us. Anton Du Beke pretends to be upset that he didn\u2019t get to do a demo time for Montell Douglas. The judges decamp to the Clauditorium to form a semi-circle and take a closer look at last night\u2019s routines. That was rather lovely, I thought, if a bit baffling story-wise. We open with a group routine from the professional troupe. It\u2019s set to Taylor Swift\u2019s 2015 sultry synth-pop ballad Wildest Dreams and choreographed by Emmy-winning Mandy Moore. She\u2019s known for her work on US shows So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing Wth The Stars, plus choreographed 2016 film La La Land, Shania Twain\u2019s La Vegas residency and Tay Tay\u2019s Eras Tour. She\u2019s also confused so often with actress and singer Mandy Moore that her social media handle is \u201cNope Not Her\u201d. Nikita Kuzmin and Karen Hauer play the leads. They\u2019re in hot pink, while everyone else is in greyscale. Visually striking, like a pop video. Romantic contempo-waft with sped-up segments. After Aljaz teases fellow pro Nikita over his Shakira faux-pas, he reveals that they\u2019ll be performing to Florence &amp; The Machine\u2019s Dog Days Are Over. Tune. Chris McCausland says of Jamie Borthwick\u2019s family: \u201cIt must be nice for them to see you on the telly without having to watch EastEnders.\u201d Chris is delighted to be doing a slow ballroom dance next week after two fast Latin numbers. Up on the balcony banquette with the happy couples who are safely through to next week, Montell Douglas reveals that they\u2019re \u201cbringing it back home\u201d with a party dance. Paul Merson and Karen Hauer are shocked to have dodged the dance-off. \u201cHonestly, when Tess called our names, I was thinking, who are Paul and Karen?\u201d he says. Bless that man. Well, that\u2019s a shocker. He\u2019s tumbled from mid-table into the bottom two. Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu must dance again for survival. Perhaps the fashion police intervened. Wynne Evans and Katya Jones are safely through, despite hand-around-waistgate. Also returns to the dancefloor are Montell Douglas, Jamie Borthwick and Tasha Ghouri. Well, obv. Strap in, it\u2019s time for loooong pauses, relieved embraces and ostentatious thanks yous down the camera. Our 13 couples await their fates. Shayne Ward\u2019s custard couture, Paul Merson\u2019s tailcoat and Gorka Marquez\u2019s waxed chest still present and correct. They\u2019ve also repaired Sarah Hadland\u2019s corsage, which she tore in her post-dance excitement last night. We\u2019ve all done it. A recap of Saturday night\u2019s action on-screen now. Paul Merson channels Fred Astaire! Pete Wicks channels Danny Zuko! Montell Douglas\u2019 gracefully gaw-jus Viennese waltz! Chris McCausland performs more miracles! Perfect 10s for Tasha Ghouri! Behold our two-headed hosting hydra, so a quick frockular face-off. Tess Daly is in a one-shouldered black jumpsuit. Claudia Winkleman is in a black sparkly minidress. Claud wins, making it a clean sweep for La Winkle this weekend. Roll clap-along credits. One of these smiley duos will be damp-eyed in approximately 35 minutes. But which, I beseech thee? Call any stragglers in from the kitchen. Wake up any post-roast nappers. We\u2019re about to head over to Elstree Studios\u2026 Musical guests on the results show are Dundee indie rockers Snow Patrol. Not to drop names but frontman Gary Lightbody is an old mate of mine. Clang! Light up, light up the dancefloor, as if you have a choice. Just five minutes now until the glittery curtain comes up\u2026 Last night saw the first maximum scores of Strictly 2024, with Tasha Ghouri and Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec notching three perfect marks for their Charleston. No prizes for guessing which judge declined not to raise his maximum paddle. Frankly, I was with Craig. Not perfect, too soon - and that Coachella/selfie stick theme deserved to knock off a point. Talking of 10s, that\u2019s how many minutes are left to wait\u2026 On BBC1 right now is Antiques Roadshow from the Ulster Folk Museum near Belfast. Glasses for hens! Sounds like something Bob Mortimer would make up on Would I Lie To You? I wonder if one day, people will find a dusty old \u201c10\u201d paddle in Craig Revel Horwood\u2019s loft? Fifteen minutes until the red spotlight of doom gets switched on\u2026 A fleeting incident caused a right kerfuffle online last night. Eagle-eyed viewers noticed that on the balcony, Wynne Evans slipped his arm around partner Katya Jones\u2019 waist but she pushed it down onto her hip. She also apparently ignoring his attempt at a high-five. As speculation grew about the significance of these awkward interactions, Evans has since said they were \u201cmessing around\u201d and apologised for any confusion. Jones insisted it was a \u201csilly joke\u201d. All rather strange. I wonder if The Great Unpleasantness this summer means everyone is on high alert for the merest sign of tension between celebrities and professionals? Is Katya deliberately distancing herself from male partners since Seann Walsh-gate? Or do we reckon something is rotten in the House of GoCompare? The glitterball will soon start spinning again\u2026 Tay Tay fans assemble! Tonight\u2019s group routine is a Taylor Swift number, choreographed by no less than Mandy Moore, who worked on the Eras tour. Not long to wait now, Swift superfans\u2026 It was touch and go whether he\u2019d be fit to dance or forced to withdraw from the competition but Nick Knowles got late medical clearance to perform last night. The DIY SOS host and his pro partner Luba Mushtuk duly delivered the Paddington-themed Charleston they\u2019d originally planned for Movie Week. However, it still left Nick just a single point off the foot of the leaderboard. Will viewers feel sorry for the injury-plagued presenter and save him from the dance-off? It\u2019s 25 minutes until we\u2019re back in the ballroom\u2026 Coming into this weekend, bookmakers\u2019 odds-on favourite for elimination was former footballer Paul Merson. However, he played it straight for the first time and pulled a surprisingly debonair Fred Astaire quickstep out of the sparkly bag. It notched his first seven and lifted him out of the bottom two on the scoreboard. But will that be backed up by viewer votes? Half an hour until glitter o\u2019clock\u2026 Somebody\u2019s hoofing adventure is about be over. Good evening and welcome to the third elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your our rhinestones-and-Spanx correspondent for tonight\u2019s results show. You are cordially invited to watch along with me as another couple bite the ballroom dust. Following last night\u2019s high-quality (if erratically scored) hoofing, our 13 pro-celebrity pairs are set become a dancefloor dozen. The judges\u2019 scores have been combined with the public vote and the bottom two will take to the ballroom floor again, bidding for survival. So who\u2019s in danger? Dr Punam Kirshan was left propping up the scoreboard with Nick Knowles second from bottom, just a point above. But will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Paul Merson, Pete Wicks or even Sarah Hadland could be in for a nervy night. It\u2019s showtime at the very slightly later time of 7.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and mild-to-medium snark. So snuggle up on this chilly autumnal evening and see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d also love to hear from you. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for dance discussion. I\u2019ll quickstep down there whenever I can to gauge your reactions and report on your musings. Yes, 13 will prove unlucky for some. Nearly time to staaaaaart eliminating! That concludes Saturday\u2019s sequin-spangled, yellow-trousered liveblog but we\u2019ll be back in ballroom hold tomorrow. Meet you right here for the results show, which airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1. I\u2019ll press \u201cgo\u201d on the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so I very much hope you\u2019ll rejoin me then. In the meantime, I\u2019m @michaelhogan on Twitter, so do rumba-walk over and say hello. Thanks for watching along with me and your ever-excellent company. Meet you here for the third elimination tomorrow. And in the meantime, as is traditional: keeeeeep dancing! Nighty night. For me, Tasha Ghouri was overmarked. A near-perfect 39 points, before we\u2019re even one-third of the way through the contest, is too much. Whither the improvement and the J-word (journey)? Down the bottom, did Paul Merson save his skin by pulling that debonair quickstep out of the bag? Dr Punam vs Nick Knowles for the dance-off would be the just outcome on Sunday night. A special shout-out to my sparkly sidekick tonight, 12-year-old Strictly superfan May, who has been helping me keep an eye on the messageboard and giggling away at all your comments. The future of hoofing punditry is in safe hands. Indeed, Somersetlass says: \u201cCan we have May as the new Strictly judge next year?\u201d Thanks for all your help, May! I owe you some extra pocket money, money, money. Final comment round-up now. TeeDubyaBee says: \u201cI love Paul Merson\u2019s presence in the background upstairs - like a slightly confused uncle at a kid\u2019s birthday party. RegWhelk says: \u201cA week that will be remembered for bonkers scoring, the first tens and Paul Merson\u2019s quickstep that seemed to come out of nowhere. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who will be in the dance-off but the good doctor must be worried.\u201d jagadox says: \u201cPete Wicks has been smiling and apparently enjoying his dancing. Has he ruined his brand as a miserable git?\u201d TeeDubyaBee says: \u201cI\u2019m surprised at how much I\u2019m liking Mr P Twix.\u201d diamondcat adds: \u201cI do wish Craig would do something about the back of his hair. It looks like the rats have been nibbling at it.\u201d Some comments on tonight\u2019s costumes now. Heartticker says: \u201cWhat has happened to wardrobe? Always loved the gorgeous Strictly costumes but this week looks like they\u2019ve been cobbled together from a child\u2019s dressing-up box.\u201d MartGray says: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have Wyn Evans do a tango, at least paint him orange.\u201d GreatIsMyNewt says: \u201cI\u2019m just wondering if wardrobe recycled Anne Widdecombe\u2019s demented canary outfit for Shayne. But glad to see that Gorka has run out of buttons again.\u201d whistledownthewind says: \u201cI\u2019m trying to work out whether Motsi\u2019s hair is tied in a reef or granny knot.\u201d MollyintheFolly adds: \u201cWhy has Motsi come out in her bathrobe?\u201d On Sarah Hadland, FloraBelle says: \u201cLoved Sarah and Vito. Shaping up to be one of my favourites this season. Even though I keep half expecting Miranda to stage bomb every time she dances.\u201d Somersetlass says: \u201cSarah and Vito\u2019s partnership is just lovely. Sarah seemed a little tentative dancing on her own at the start, but once she was in hold, it was beautiful.\u201d jagadox adds: \u201cI enjoyed Vito and Sarah. A possible finalist combo?\u201d On Jamie Borthwick, EastofStratford says: \u201cPoor Jamie, he suffers from ESDL (Englishman shorts disaster legs). It is incurable but a better cut of shorts can do a lot to divert the eye.\u201d On JB Gill, SparklingDormouse says: \u201cPretty good rumba from JB &amp; Amy. Good movement and a good connection between them.\u201d On Punam\u2019s jive, Heartticker says: \u201cIt didn\u2019t really get going for me. A bit flat-footed and a few mistakes but an extra point for Gorka\u2019s abs.\u201d FascinatingFlamenco adds: \u201cMessy. Jive is meant to be sharp and incisive and that was soft and all over the place. Loved Punam\u2019s dance last week, but this one just wasn\u2019t her.\u201d On Paul Merson, Somersetlass says: \u201cHow lovely to see Paul doing a serious dance. I really enjoyed that - ballroom has brought out the best in him. Fairly light on his feet, and although he still looked rather terrified, he\u2019s made such progress. This is what Strictly is all about.\u201d jagadox adds: \u201cPaul and quickstep seemed like a contradiction. And turned out to be - if not quite Fred Astaire then not yomping over a muddy field in wellies. A decent and somewhat surprising effort.\u201d Sparkling Dormouse says: \u201cReally classy from JoJo &amp; Montell. Lovely from them. Best so far tonight and the first one deserving a nine!\u201d FloraBelle adds: \u201cMontelle and JoJo were just gorgeous there. Such elegant lines and her smile was infectious. Beautiful dress, cute hair ribbon and loved the staging too.\u201d On Chris McCausland, FloraBelle says: \u201cNever mind Men At Work. Chris works like a Trojan. As someone who is visually impaired myself, I am in awe of both him and Diane. Just wow.\u201d Vicc says: \u201cChris and Dianne are amazing. Those lifts. The fact that he doesn\u2019t miss a cue which would normally be a visual one. Impressive to put it mildly!\u201d Heartticker adds: \u201cChris and Dianne impressed once again. Diane is an amazing teacher. I think she\u2019s fabulous and has been a little underrated in the past.\u201d On Tasha\u2019s Charleston, SparklingDormouse says: \u201cPoints off for the selfie stick and Aljaz over-emoting. Apart from that, amazing. Can\u2019t tell who the professional is. Just not getting the improvement element as she\u2019s too good to start with!\u201d Gardener_Maidhc says of Pete Wicks\u2019 quickstep: \u201cFaux quiff short hair really suits Pete. The leading arm elbow drops a bit in hold which throws his posture off but great styling and a good dance. Not my favourite but my favourite of his so far.\u201d On Nick Knowles\u2019 miraculous rise from the physio\u2019s table, Heartticker says: \u201cNick Knowles just danced a very strange Charleston, I thought. I know he\u2019s had an injury or two but a bit boring in my opinion.\u201d whistledownthewind says: \u201cGood to see that Nick Knowles WILL dance tonight. Mind you with his current luck, he\u2019ll possibly sprain his ankle on his way down the stairs during the intro.\u201d IvanTiger says: \u201cNick needs more swivel, though he\u2019s in time and has arm elegance.\u201d jagadox adds: \u201cGlad to see Nick back. Enjoyed the dance too, although perhaps not the greatest Charleston we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Time to take the temperature of your comments. Lots of talk of overmarking. ryfford says \u201cWeek 4 and 10s, FFS. PERLEASZE!!!!\u201d VirgilHilts says: \u201cIt\u2019s week 4 on Strictly and the theme is Insane Overmarking!\u201d irreverentnurse says: \u201cRidiculous scores for Jamie.\u201d Petebail says: \u201cOvermarking won\u2019t do Jamie any favours in the public vote.\u201d fernzette adds: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the scoring? Overmarked for the dances I\u2019ve seen so far. Oh and Tess looks like a pack of Parma violets unraveling.\u201d Viewers can now flip to BBC2 for 40 Hidden Music Treasures At The BBC or it\u2019s Angela Rippon Night on BBC4 to celebrate her 80th birthday - and right now, she\u2019s looking back at her Come Dancing days. At 10.30pm, TV\u2019s Greatest: Black on the Box on Channel 5 pays tribute to the likes of Lenny Henry, Floella Benjamin and Trevor McDonald. If you fancy a film, choose at 9pm between Heat on Legend, Face/Off on Great Movies, 300 on 5Star or Last of the Mohicans on Film4. At 10pm, The Sixth Sense is on MTV. At 10.30pm, Jordan Peele\u2019s Us is on BBC1. As Nick Ross used to say, don\u2019t have nightmares. They\u2019re the most coveted made-up awards this side of Coachella festival. Here are this week\u2019s gong-grabbers\u2026 Best dance: Tasha and Alija\u017e\u2019s three 10s have to clinch it but Montell Douglas\u2019 dreamy waltz and Paul Merson\u2019s first sevens run her close. Worst dance: Nick and Luba\u2019s lumpen Charleston. Dr Punam\u2019s jive scored one fewer point but had more to offer. Best music choice: Pop divas Shakira and Lizzo. A good week overall for Dave Arch and his band. Their version of I Won\u2019t Dance by Fred Astaire had serious swing, too. Worst music choice: Men At Work. Sorry, Dianne\u2019s dad. Best outfit: A three-way tie between Sam\u2019s samba dress, Karen\u2019s pink beaded quickstep frock and those 50s outfits for \u201cPetita\u201d. Worst outfit: Shayne and Nancy\u2019s sickly yellow monstrosities. To add insult to injury, they reused the fabric for Chris McCausland\u2019s trousers. Best judges\u2019 comment: Craig was on top form, from imitating Shirley (\u201cYou might learn something\u201d) to mocking Anton\u2019s grunts (\u201cThe espresso\u2019s kicked in, I see\u201d). Worst VT: Jamie and Michelle dahn the old East End snooker hall. Awkz. Best Claudia quip: I enjoyed \u201cPete gets a tattoo \u2013 his first\u201d but the prize goes to Claud holding up her hand to Vito: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a high-five, it was a halt.\u201d Unsurprisingly after the first 10s of the series, Tasha Ghouri tops the scoreboard by a distance, with Jamie Borthwick and Wynne Evans in joint second spot. Dr Punam Krishan is way down at the bottom, with Nick Knowles just above. As always, though the viewer vote helps decide which two couples are consigned to tomorrow night\u2019s dance-off. It could be a nervy wait for Paul Merson, Sarah Hadland and Sam Quek too. \u201cKeeeeeep dancing,\u201d chirrup Tess and Claud. As the glittery dust settles, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Tonight\u2019s routines now get recapped on-screen. Which fab-ew-lous pair are you voting for? Which dance dis-ah-ster are you definitely not? Cue props, mugging for the camera and all-round pandemonium in the Clauditorium, set to Spandau Ballet\u2019s Gold (one of my karaoke staples, FYI). When did this enjoyably daft Saturday night tradition start? Last five series or so, do we reckon? It\u2019s hard to remember a time without it. Judges\u2019 scores for Tasha and Alja\u017e: 9, 10 (first of the series), 10 (never too early from Shirley), 10 for a total of 39 points. Wowzers. Too much, too soon? Judges\u2019 comments for Tasha and Alja\u017e: Motsi says \u201cone word \u2013 fab-u-lous\u201d. That\u2019s not your line, Motsi. Shirley says \u201cpractically flawless\u201d. Anton says \u201ccan\u2019t fault it\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cleft foot let you down but a-may-zing\u201d. Nines ahoy? They topped last week\u2019s leaderboard with their Barbie rumba. Thankfully Alja\u017e has now lost the mildly disturbing blond Ken wig. Tasha Ghouri is a graceful dancer - she\u2019s racked up 99 points in her three dances so far, the most in the field - but can she showcase her fun side and capture the Charleston\u2019s manic, kooky energy? It\u2019s selfies-at-Coachella-themed, for some random Gen Z reason, with Tasha in cowgirl-ish fringed shorts and a crop top. Selfie stick-ography, which is a sentence I never thought I\u2019d type. Fast-paced, upbeat and intense with loads of steps, tricks and content. Their first time doing lifts. Craig will be studying those lumpy dismounts, as well as the all-important swivel. A little stilted and disappointing for me. Song: Unhealthy by Anne-Marie feat Shania Twain. The country-pop single from last year is about a toxic relationship with a western-style video filmed in Nashville and, ahem, Kent. Judges\u2019 scores for Pete and Jowita: 7, 7, 8, 7 for a total of 29 points. His highest score. Generous in my book but hard to complain when he\u2019s on the trademarked Strictly journey. Judges\u2019 comments for Pete and Jowita: Craig says \u201chip rolls do not belong but I actually liked it\u201d. Motsi says \u201clike the John Travolta vibe but not consistent and transitions let you down\u201d. Shirley says \u201cyou belted across the floor and shifted your weight, technically better, frame dropped but the hip roll was a treat\u201d. Anton concludes \u201copen work was brilliant but in hold, the voices in your head start screaming, you\u2019ve got potential, make the next leap and don\u2019t run out of weeks because you could challenge\u201d. Sixes? After last week\u2019s barefoot jungle samba, at least he\u2019s back wearing shoes now. Pete Wicks and his pro partner Jowita Przystal have been the subject of showmance speculation on the tabloids this week, so see if you can detect any signs of sizzling chemistry. Pete\u2019s been slowly improving and his scores creeping up each week. Knowing and loving the song - he says for the first time this series - should help. Tattoo parlour them, aptly, and 50s styling with quiff. Speed and energy but he\u2019s struggling to stay in time. Rigid face when he should be smiling, visibly counting aloud and lacking lightness of footwork. Swagger and story but not much quickstep, bless him. Song: Town Called Malice by The Jam. Paul Weller wrote the Motown-influenced 1982 chart-topper about his desire to escape his hometown of Woking. Judges\u2019 scores for Sam and Nikita: 7, 7, 7, 7 for a total of 28 points. Mid-table. Sam says she\u2019s celebrating her body and her curves like never before. More power to her. Nikita makes random noises and Claudia says \u201cVito is catching\u201d. Judges\u2019 comments for Sam and Nikita: Motsi says \u201cbam, bam, hit those lines and threw yourself into it, lots of challenging contents, needed more bounce but damn girl\u201d. Shirley says \u201cgood timing, awkward in transitions but full of personality\u201d. Anton says \u201cgave it the full biffter, you\u2019re in a great place, very strong, just keep your weight forward\u201d. Craig concludes \u201clacked bounce, messy misplaced footwork but you sold it fantastically\u201d. Sam Quek\u2019s Tomb Raider paso last week saw her score rise into the 30s for the first time. Can she continue that form? She needs to attack it, committing to the samba\u2019s details and precision. She\u2019s channelling a Latina character called \u201cSamba Samantha\u201d, apparently. Vibrant neon rainbow frock with flouncy skirt. Unleashing her hips, rhythm changes and sass galore but rather rushing through the moves. A tad heavy footed at times but hot, hot, hot. Song: Hips Don\u2019t Lie by Shakira. Not the other one, Nikita. When Nikita Kuzmin made that hilarious faux-pas on last week\u2019s results show, singing the wrong Shakira song, he\u2019d already started choreography to Whenever, Wherever. Oopsy. A great TV moment, nonetheless. Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: 8, 8, 8, 9 for a total of 33 points. Third on the scoreboard so far. Jojo admits that his main aim was not to get a demo time from Anton. \u201cThat\u2019s brave, he can hear you,\u201d says Claudia. Judges\u2019 comments for Montell and Jojo: Anton says \u201cso beautiful, my favourite dance of the night, exquisite\u201d. Craig says \u201cgraceful, elegant, gaw-jus (told you)\u201d. Motsi says \u201cloved the softness and simplicity\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cinfectious personality, divine, great teamwork, creeping up there, you\u2019re dangerous for the rest\u201d. Eights and even a nine? The Gladiator\u2019s second consecutive ballroom after her Dreamgirls tango in Movie Week. She needs to show improvement in hold, as her posture wobbled last week. Johannes gets his own \u201cWater\u201d Gladiator outfit in the VT. Montell Douglas is waiting for her man in a moonlit motel. Smooth and elegant, gliding around the floor. Dizzying spins and heart-meltingly romantic mood. Threw away a few extensions but generally gaw-jus. Song: Nobody Gets Me by SZA. The r\u2019n\u2019b diva\u2019s country-tinged single from last year with lyrics about rekindling with an ex but ending up arguing. In case you were wondering, SZA\u2019s stange name stands for Sol\u00e1na (her real name) Zig-Zag Allah. It\u2019s taken from the Supreme Alphabet and inspired by RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan. Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: 6, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 30 points. Joint third as we enter the home stretch. Judges\u2019 comments for Chris and Dianne: Shirley says \u201cI\u2019m speechless, how you do those lifts so flawlessly without eye timing I can\u2019t imagine, didn\u2019t miss a trick timing-wise, impressive\u201d. Anton says \u201cyou even made the kangaroo steps work, salsa steps a bit plonky but still remarkable\u201d. Craig from Ballarat does his best Aussie accent and says \u201cstompy, lacked flow and fluidity but bonzer\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cI like development of your Latin, great musicality, a joy\u201d. Sevens and eights, do we say? Another energetic, upbeat dance for blind comedian Chris McCausland, following last week\u2019s Wayne\u2019s World jive. Craig commented on his great timing and musical ear, so Dianne Buswell cleverly choreographs to play to his strengths - as well as choosing an Aussie theme for a taste of home. It\u2019s fast and full-on with \u201cmore bloody lifts than Canary Wharf\u201d, according to Chris. Tricks and hip action. Speed, lots of steps and cracking lifts. Some kangaroo jumps, unless I\u2019m mistaken. Lacks spice and hip action but otherwise stupendous. So good, it almost made me forgive those yellow slacks. Song: Down Under by Men at Work. The Australian band\u2019s 1983 chart-topper is about an Australian man travelling the tourist trail in \u201ca fried-out Kombi\u201d, meaning a Volkswagen camper van. Do you speak-a my language? He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich. Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Amy: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Solidly top half. Judges\u2019 comments for JB and Amy: Craig says \u201cyou got stuck, lacked connection but you did a difficult dance justice\u201d. Motsi says \u201cI saw technique, leg action and Cuban motion, passion, enjoyed it\u201d. Shirley says \u201csultry, lovely forward work but needs more rotation, rather enjoyed it\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cyou\u2019re a dream student but I\u2019d like to see more freedom, so let it go\u201d. Sevens and the odd eight? He wowed last week with his West End-worthy Willy Wonka number and is turning into quite the ballroom boy but now it\u2019s back to Latin for JB Gill. His pro partner Amy Dowden loves the rumba and this is her first one on Strictly but it\u2019s notoriously challenging for celebrity males. JB\u2019s been struggling with the tricky technique in training this week. It\u2019s slow and exposing with nowhere to hide but he\u2019s doing a very decent job indeed. Sensual and romantic, with a nice connection established between them. Lacks a little continuous flow and earthiness, she\u2019s dancing around him at times, but sizzling, stylish and smouldering. Song: You Might Need Somebody by Kara Marni. A cover of the jazz-soul hit made famous by Randy Crawford in the 80s and Shola Ama in the 90s. Judges\u2019 scores for Paul and Karen: 4 (boo!), 6, 6, 7 for a total of 23 points. His highest yet and out of the bottom two. Claudia suggests he\u2019s a great dancer and Paul wryly replies \u201cSteady on\u201d. Judges\u2019 comments for Paul and Karen: Anton says \u201cI take my top hat off to you, what a job, no irony, did it straight, just great\u201d. Craig says \u201cfix the style, frame, heaviness and gapping but we have progression\u201d. Motsi says \u201cyou melted my heart, eyes up and smile\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201ccame down the stairs looking sophisticated, I was smiling inside, delightful, Mr Debonair\u201d. Sixes, do we reckon? The wild west dance-off survivors attempt a proper ballroom routine for the first time. No props, fancy dress or comedy factor this time. Paul Merson is trying to keep a straight face for a sophisticated Fred Astaire number. Looking debonair in a tailsuit with top hat and cane. Very gentlemanly. With the axe hovering over him, he\u2019ll need to show improved technique and timing if he\u2019s going to escape another dance-off. Old-style Hollywood feel and cane-ography, then into hold. He\u2019s jogging rather than skipping but great effort, even if he looks slightly terrified. Some showmanship if not all the footwork. Song: I Won\u2019t Dance by Fred Astaire. This playful jazz standard from the 1930s has been recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Johnny Mathis and Lady Gaga with Tony Bennett. Strictly alumnus Will Young crooned it for Pop Idol: The Big Band Album and Jessica Lange for the Grey Gardens soundtrack. Judges\u2019 scores for Punam and Gorka: 4, 5, 5, 6 for a total of 20 points. Bottom as it stands. Judges\u2019 comments for Punam and Gorka: Motsi says \u201cpressure got to you after last week, quite a few mistakes, hot and cold\u201d. Shirley says \u201clacked rotation but great kick section, you\u2019ve got the support of the nation and we love you\u201d. Anton says \u201cI tied my own tie, see you next week\u201d. Craig concludes \u201csloppy, messy, full of mistakes, not your night\u201d. Four from Craig, fives from the rest? Dr Punam Krishan came alive last week and reduced Motsi to tears with her milestone Bollywood routine, which took her to the dizzy heights of joint second on the leaderboard. Can she keep that momentum going? Strange pink foil outfits and futuristic diner theme. An energetic jive with plenty of flicks and kicks but she needs more control and retraction. Could be on the balls of her feet more to keep it lighter. She hops up up on chair and table at the end. Technically shaky and lost timing but fun. Not quite what the doctor ordered. Song: 2 Be Loved (Am I Ready) by Lizzo. The pop diva and classically trained flautist\u2019s 2022 single. Its retro new wave-meets-disco sound has been compared to both the Pointer Sisters and Hall &amp; Oates, which is totally fine by me. Judges\u2019 scores for Wynne and Katya: 8, 9, 9, 8 for a total of 34 points. His highest yet and joint top with Jamie. \u201cI\u2019m an overweight opera singer and I\u2019m having the best time,\u201d says Wynne. \u201cMaybe fat men can dance after all. I found my ribs this week after not seeing them since 1987.\u201d Judges\u2019 comments for Wynne and Katya: Anton says \u201ccommitted to the concept and character, tremendous, one of your best\u201d. Craig says \u201cthumb sticking up but love, love, loved it, Wynne, Wynne, Wynne\u201d. Motsi says \u201cyour best dance yet, story with quality underneath\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201ctook risks, passionate, told a tale, I got goosebumps, you\u2019re in it to win it, mate\u201d. He\u2019s had sevens and eights for the past two weeks and might just better that here. Wynne Evans casts off the Mrs Doubtfire costume to show his more serious side. It\u2019s a Wall Street-style story with his pro partner Katya Jones playing a financier\u2019s disgruntled secretary. He\u2019s been working hard on his tango posture, so needs to keep his legs low and spine straight. Briefcase-ography, tie-adjusting and takes far too long to get going. Assertive and leading well, although the effort is visible on his face. Lacks snap and staccato. Not quite on the money, money, money for me but the audience love it. Song: Money, Money, Money by Abba. The Swedish pop deities\u2019 1976 hit was originally titled Gypsy Girl and was the only Abba single during their mid-70s imperial phase not to top the UK chart. Deborah Meaden and the much-missed Robin Windsor also tangoed to it during the 2013 series. Judges\u2019 scores for Jamie and Michelle: 8, 9, 9, 8 for a total of 34 points. His best yet and top of the leaderboard after four dances. Judges\u2019 comments for Jamie and Michelle: Shirley is momentarily lost for words but says \u201cshifted from foot to foot, led your lady and brought joy, your best dance so far\u201d. Anton says \u201cby far your best, superb energy, feet and hips could\u2019ve worked more but killing it from the waist up\u201d. Craig says \u201cneeded more figure-of-eight in the hip action but you\u2019re an incredible dancer\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cgreat partnering but you shone in the spotlight, you left your heart on the dancefloor\u201d. I\u2019m smelling eights. Or is it Ambre Solaire? EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick closed the show last week, dressed as Su Pollard (or was it Elton John?) for his Rocketman quickstep. Now he needs to keep that high energy but control it and show some Cuban party technique. He\u2019s playing a holiday rep, she\u2019s a tourist. Flog those excursions, Jamie. Free cocktail for lady! Best bar on island! Fast and fluid with changes of rhythm. Shoulder shimmies and his first lifts but a lumpy dismount. Lacking spice but heaps of high-energy fun and a strong finish. Song: Danza Kuduro by Don Omar and Lucenzo. This 2010 banger mixes Latin with reggaeton and duly became a worldwide hit, topping the chart in a dozen countries. It stayed at number one in Italy for a whopping 10 weeks. Judges\u2019 scores for Nick and Luba: 4, 6, 5, 6 for a total of 21 points. Dance-off danger? My liveblog assistant tonight, 12-year-old May, says: \u201cShame Nick isn\u2019t dressed as Paddington - but he does dance like a bear!\u201d Judges\u2019 comments for Nick and Luba: Craig says \u201clet yourself go and be more crazy, extend your lines, placed rather than danced, no swivel but fantastic character\u201d. Motsi says \u201ccoming back took courage, slow pace but tidy and readable\u201d. Shirley says \u201ctook risks, used props, lovely synchronisation but I missed a sense of freedom\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cenjoyed the number, you improved Craig\u2019s choreography, exquisite timing\u201d. Fives and sixes? After missing last week\u2019s show, injury-prone DIY SOS host Nick Knowles\u2019 knee is on the mend and doctors have given him clearance to dance. Because of his reduced training time, they\u2019re picking up where they left off with the Paddington number they had planned for Movie Week. Nick\u2019s pleased to be belatedly doing it, as his 10-year-old son Eddie is a fan of the Peruvian bear. He\u2019s unleashing his showbizzy, jazz-handy side to play villainous thesp Phoenix Buchanan, with Luba Mushtuk as the late Queen\u2019s mate. She\u2019s adjusted the steps to be easier on his knees. It duly lacks a little bounce and speed but has a sweet musical theatre feel. Brolly-ography, lifts and tricks. Heavy-footed but happiness-making. Song: Rain on the Roof from Paddington 2. Originally from the musical Follies, it\u2019s sung at the end of the film by Phoenix in prison - and the accompanying dance number was choroegraphed by no less than Craig Revel Horwood. Pit-pitty-pat indeed. Judges\u2019 scores for Sarah and Vito: 6, 7, 7, 7 for a total of 27 points. A slight dip. Judges\u2019 comments for Sarah and Vito: Shirley says \u201cflawless spotting on the spins but your footwork didn\u2019t glide, work on the seamlessness in ballroom\u201d. Anton says \u201cshort steps, too trotty, lost its flow, lovely storyteling but stride out\u201d. Craig says \u201clacked glide, gapping, too much attack but magnificent turns, you\u2019re a clean, clean dancer\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cyou capture the music as you dance, allow yourself to breathe and let go\u201d. Sevens a-coming? Her Harry Potter waltz last week was Motsi\u2019s highlight of the night and saw her joint second on the scoreboard. Again. Now actor Sarah Hadland stays in ballroom hold for a graceful and lyrical foxtrot. She\u2019s sporting a blue aqua floral frock, like a grown-up Elsa from Frozen. Emotional with lovely lines, delicate details and softness. The song is a favourite of her and her daughter, so there\u2019s real feeling in this. A bit wobbly in places but lovely. Song: Birds of a Feather by Billie Eilish. The recent single which featured in teen Netflix drama Heartstopper and was performed by Eilish at the Olympic Closing Ceremony. Not to be coinfused with the theme tune to 90s sitcom Birds of a Feather which was, of course, What\u2019ll I Do. Sharon! Tracey! Dorien from next door! We\u2019ve only just got rid of him. The picture-slamming spexy beast is this week\u2019s surprise Clauditorium guest, reading out the voting Ts &amp; Cs. Judges\u2019 scores for Shayne and Nancy: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Generous. Judges\u2019 comments for Shayne and Nancy: Motsi says \u201ccool, calm and collected but use your arms more\u201d. Shirley says \u201chuge improvement since your week one samba, loved the sense of freedom, work on that co-ordination and posture\u201d. Anton says \u201cloved the partnering and connection, keep the improvement going\u201d. Craig concludes \u201clacked resistance and tone (boo!), arms need attention but great groove, liked it a lot\u201d. Sevens, do we think? Shayne Ward\u2019s scores have been steadily rising. Can he continue to show improvement in his first Latin number since week one? Bowling alley theme. Ghastly neon custard-coloured outfits. Showcasing his fun side with solo sections and hip action. Timing and leg technique are the challenge here. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s nailing the latter. A fun disco number and a decent semi-moonwalk to end. Song: Ain\u2019t No Love (Ain\u2019t No Use) by Sub Sub feat Melanie Williams. This 1993 dance banger sampled Good Morning Starshine from Hair, which a band member owned on vinyl because he won it at a fair in his teens. Sub Sub later reinvented themselves as indie band Doves, trivia fans. First sighting of our couples as they come out for a welcome wave. Outfits are positively understated compared to last week\u2019s Movie Week overload. Lots of pink. Wonder if Wynne Evans feels naked without his Mrs Doubtfire costume? And if Pete Wicks feels restricted in, you know, actual clothes and shoes? Here come the hoofing inspectors, Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and Shirley Ballas, cutting some rug to Lionel Ritchie\u2019s Dancing On The Ceiling. Synchronised sit-down in three, two, one\u2026 Sit! Ooh, I felt like Barbara Woodhouse there. The hostly duo arrive, so time for our weekly couture comparison. Tess Daly is in a lilac shoulder-less jumpsuit affair. Claudia Winkleman is in a simple black frock with a pop of red lippy. Claud wins. Only the gingers have left so far, with Tom Dean and Toyah Willcox becoming the first two celebrities to depart the dancefloor. Who\u2019s next for the auburn axe? Cue the usual scene-setting, tension-building montage. Grab a glass and nab some nibbles. We\u2019re about to go over live to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 Alan Carr\u2019s Picture Slam reaching a bifocal crescendo on BBC1 now. That\u2019s Numberwang! Tonight\u2019s musical selections include Abba, Shakira, Lizzo and Billie Eilish, as well as a reggaeton favourite and a banger by The Jam. Well, it beats the George Of The Jungle theme song. A mere five minutes until the glitterball starts spinning\u2026 There was an official BBC announcement this week that on Saturday 2nd November, we can look forward to Strictly\u2019s first ever Icons Week, with dances inspired by musical legends - and just as temptingly, a Beyonc\u00e9-themed pro dance led by Jojo Radebe. Now that\u2019s what I call bootylicious. Ten minutes until the glittery clock strikes\u2026 Anyone see Gogglebox last night? Giles and Mary were amusingly outraged by Pete Wicks\u2019 pelvic thrusting in a leopard print loincloth. Oh, Nutty. Meanwhile, over on Have I Got News For You, Paul Merton said of Ed Balls\u2019 Gangnam Style salsa: \u201cIf that had happened in a public park, he would\u2019ve been arrested.\u201d Heeeeey, sexy lady. We can look forward to two salsas, two quicksteps and two Charlestons, among various other choreographic treats. No Couple\u2019s Choices, slightly surprisingly. Not long until the spangly curtain comes up\u2026 Tick them off with a flourish when you spot them on-screen! Take a drink for each! End up face down in a kebab! Here\u2019s this week\u2019s 10-point checklist: Tess Daly exclaims \u201cThey\u2019re on their feet!\u201d to someone who can patently see that everyone is on their feet Eliminated pro Ginger Neil elbows his way to the front of the balcony crowd Jamie Borthwick risks their wrath by doing an impression of the judges Celebrity relative in the front row glances up at the monitor, then gives an embarrassed wave Anton says \u201cThat was the sort of routine I\u2019d have loved to dance\u201d Shirley Ballas produces her pair of haunted Victorian child\u2019s shoes again Chris McCausland gives some post-critique lip to Craig Way-too-soon mention of Halloween or Blackpool Anton calls a demo time to teach better ballroom hold Judge says \u201cIt\u2019s week four now, so we\u2019re looking for footwork and technique\u201d The show\u2019s running time tonight is a nice, round two hours - fully 15 minutes shorter than last week. Snappy. It\u2019s 15 minutes until the glittery klaxon sounds\u2026 Could it be knockout time for Paul Merson? He\u2019s the lowest scorer left in the contest, is yet to score more than a six and appeared in last week\u2019s dance-off. Bookies say he\u2019s odds-on favourite for the exit. Tipped to join him in the dance-off are either Pete Wicks or Nick Knowles. Both Paul and Pete are dancing quicksteps this evening, which should make for an intriguing comparison. Not long until we get our first choreographic clues\u2026 Yes, he\u2019s back from the sickbay! A BBC spokesperson announced on Friday night: \u201cWe are all delighted that Nick Knowles and Luba Mushtuk will be dancing in this Saturday\u2019s show. Nick has been cleared to dance by the medical and physio teams following his injury last week. Due to time taken out of training this week, they will be performing their Movie Week Charleston to Rain On The Roof from Paddington 2.\u201d Good news all round. Nobody wanted an injury dropout. We\u2019ll also finally get to see Luba\u2019s Paddington outfit. It could get sweaty, dancing in a duffel coat and floppy hat. Just 20 minutes until spray tan-and-Spanx time\u2026 That\u2019s a wrap. Yes, the credits have rolled on Movie Week and there\u2019s no fancy dress for our hoofing couples to hide behind. Good evening and welcome to the latest live weekend of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your virtual dance partner for tonight\u2019s mercifully non-themed show. You are warmly invited to watch along with me as our 13 surviving pro-celebrity pairs take to the Elstree Studios dancefloor once more. After last week\u2019s celluloid special and second elimination - when Toyah Willcox followed Tom Dean onto the glittery bus home - our unlucky 13 will become a dancefloor dozen this weekend. Tonight\u2019s scores will be combined with the public vote and the bottom two duos will perform for survival on Sunday night. Who\u2019ll become the third celebrity to bite the ballroom dust? Dance-off survivor Paul Merson looks the most vulnerable. Pete Wicks, Dr Puman Krishan and Nick Knowles, bouncing back from his injury, could also find themselves in danger. It\u2019s showtime at 6.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 5.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and ballroom backchat. So hold your calls, cancel your social plans and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for the usual sequin-spangled discussion. I\u2019ll Charleston swivel down there every now and again to gauge your reaction and report on your witty wisdom. In week four, who\u2019ll be weak on the floor? Nearly time to staaaart dancing!",

      "body": "<p>An MSP has been expelled from the SNP over comments about the Israel-Hamas conflict, which his party described as \u201cutterly abhorrent\u201d.</p> <p>The Glasgow Shettleston MSP, John Mason, posted on social media in August: \u201cIf Israel wanted to commit genocide, they would have killed 10 times as many.\u201d</p> <p>He was reacting to former SNP MSP Sandra White, who had said: \u201cWe know what Israelis hope to achieve they are already committing genocide in Gaza,\u201d adding that \u201cinnocent children are being massacred\u201d.</p> <p>Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s former Westminster leader, was among those who criticised Mason\u2019s comments, saying on X: \u201cYou are not fit for public office. You are an embarrassment and not fit to represent anyone.\u201d</p> <p>In a post on X on Sunday, Mason revealed he had been expelled by the party over his comments.</p> <p>\u201cVery disappointed to be expelled from the SNP over my comments on Israel, Gaza, and whether or not there has been genocide,\u201d he said in the post.</p> <p>\u201cI continue to believe that we should be able to tolerate a variety of views within the party as long as we are all committed to Scottish independence.\u201d</p> <p>After the decision to remove the whip in August, a party spokesperson said: \u201cTo flippantly dismiss the death of more than 40,000 Palestinians is completely unacceptable.</p> <p>\u201cThere can be no room in the SNP for this kind of intolerance.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/13/alex-salmond-had-huge-political-impact-says-john-swinney-scotland\">Tributes paid to Alex Salmond\u2019s \u2018colossal contribution\u2019 to Scottish and UK politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the time, the spokesperson added: \u201cThe chief whip has today withdrawn the whip from John Mason MSP with immediate effect, pending internal parliamentary group due process.\u201d</p> <p>In a radio interview, Mason stood by his comments after the decision to remove the whip.</p> <p>He also wrote in a Facebook post that his \u201cprimary desire in relation to Israel and Gaza is that there should be peace talks, negotiations, and eventually peace\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cToo many lives have already been lost in Israel, Gaza, and beyond and, as I said when I spoke in parliament, many people feel that Israel has moved from a position of self-defence to seeking revenge.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, I personally do not believe that Israel has tried to commit, has committed, or is committing genocide.</p> <p>\u201cThey certainly have the ability to kill many more Palestinians than they have done.

The Glasgow Shettleston MSP, John Mason, posted on social media in August: \u201cIf Israel wanted to commit genocide, they would have killed 10 times as many.\u201d He was reacting to former SNP MSP Sandra White, who had said: \u201cWe know what Israelis hope to achieve they are already committing genocide in Gaza,\u201d adding that \u201cinnocent children are being massacred\u201d. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s former Westminster leader, was among those who criticised Mason\u2019s comments, saying on X: \u201cYou are not fit for public office. You are an embarrassment and not fit to represent anyone.\u201d In a post on X on Sunday, Mason revealed he had been expelled by the party over his comments. \u201cVery disappointed to be expelled from the SNP over my comments on Israel, Gaza, and whether or not there has been genocide,\u201d he said in the post. \u201cI continue to believe that we should be able to tolerate a variety of views within the party as long as we are all committed to Scottish independence.\u201d After the decision to remove the whip in August, a party spokesperson said: \u201cTo flippantly dismiss the death of more than 40,000 Palestinians is completely unacceptable. \u201cThere can be no room in the SNP for this kind of intolerance.\u201d At the time, the spokesperson added: \u201cThe chief whip has today withdrawn the whip from John Mason MSP with immediate effect, pending internal parliamentary group due process.\u201d In a radio interview, Mason stood by his comments after the decision to remove the whip. He also wrote in a Facebook post that his \u201cprimary desire in relation to Israel and Gaza is that there should be peace talks, negotiations, and eventually peace\u201d. He added: \u201cToo many lives have already been lost in Israel, Gaza, and beyond and, as I said when I spoke in parliament, many people feel that Israel has moved from a position of self-defence to seeking revenge. \u201cHowever, I personally do not believe that Israel has tried to commit, has committed, or is committing genocide. \u201cThey certainly have the ability to kill many more Palestinians than they have done. That is not to say that the loss of life already is not too many.\u201d An SNP spokesperson said: \u201cAs the disciplinary process includes the right to appeal, the issue remains live and we cannot comment prior to its conclusion.\u201d",

There was plenty of goodwill towards Lee Carsley after his first window as England\u2019s interim manager, with the BBC among those surmising that the job was his to lose. All that goodwill evaporated on Thursday night, when England were beaten by Greece after Carsley picked an, a-hem, experimental XI that inccluded five forwards and no striker.</p> <p>Carsley was praised by many before the game for letting England\u2019s hair down, then ridiculed after it for being a bald fraud. And while it\u2019s almost entirely unfair, Carsley\u2019s distinguished England coaching career will probably now be remembered for the night he gambled on a 4-1-5-0 formation.</p> <p>\u201cYou want the public to trust and love the team,\u201d said Carsley, \u201cbecause the impact the national team has on the public is very inspiring. We know we can do a lot better. You have to respect people\u2019s opinions and we didn\u2019t perform as well as we can and I would expect a reaction against Finland.\u201d</p> <p>England will pick a more conventional team in Finland, with Harry Kane likely to return up front, and they yet could end the day joint-top of Group B2. That would require the Republic of Ireland to win in Greece but, as England know all too well, stranger things have happened.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>5pm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/11/lee-carsley-intends-to-row-back-on-england-tactics-after-chastening-loss\">Lee Carsley intends to row back on England tactics after chastening loss</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-13T17:06:11.273Z\">at 6.06pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with Dave Hytner\u2019s report from Helsinki. Thanks for your company and emails; goodnight! The team responded really well and scored three good goals. I thought we were a lot better tonight \u2013 we played with a lot more control. Looking at the data we\u2019ve just got, we had massive possession, lots and lots of passes, created lots of chances. But I think we can still be better. Finland were very well organised, with five at the back, and there wasn\u2019t a lot of space. When you have as much possession as we did, you\u2019re always going to get chances from 70 minutes onwards and it was good that the subs made an im pact. Trent\u2019s quality speaks for itself; he\u2019s more than earned his place. We do get bogged down with whether he\u2019s left-back or right-back but what\u2019s more important is that he gets in effective positions. Jack (Grealish) was outstanding tonight. I think he\u2019d have been really effective against Greece and I wish we could fast forward and play them next week. [Do you want the job?] I\u2019ve not really thought that much about it. My remit was to do six games and I\u2019m really enjoying it. I didn\u2019t enjoy it so much in the last two days \u2013 I\u2019m not used to losing with an England team and I don\u2019t take losing very well. My bosses have made it totally clear what they need from me. This job deserves a world-class coach who has won trophies and been there and done it, and I\u2019m still on the path to that. We could\u2019ve had a few more goals, especially towards the end as the game opened up. It was difficult at times in the first half and we\u2019re a bit gutted to concede at the end, but we needed a win and we got it. [On his goal] It comes from the manager giving us all the freedom to move around. I play with Angel every day in training and I know what a top player he is. It was a brilliant assist. [On Alexander-Arnold\u2019s goal] I said to him, \u2018If you score this I\u2019ll give you \u00a3500\u2019 and he just slapped it in the top bin! [On Lee Carsley] Whatever happens with the England manager you\u2019ll always have some people saying negative stuff. I don\u2019t really get it. He\u2019s a top, top guy, a brilliant manager and I love playing for him. All over in Helsinki. It wasn\u2019t the most emphatic response from England to Thursday night\u2019s minor fiasco, but they were deserved winners. The pick of the goals was a delicious free-kick from Trent Alexander-Arnold, playing at left-back for the first time in living memory. He was also part of a sporadically shaky defensive performance. Jack Grealish and Declan Rice scored England\u2019s other goals \u2013 Grealish after excellent work from Angel Gomes \u2013 before Arttu Hoskonen headed a deserved consolation for Finland. 90 min Grealish\u2019s low cross is cut out by Hoskonen on the six-yard line. He almost gives the ball straight to Foden but eventually manages to clear. Four minutes of added time. 89 min \u201cAntman isn\u2019t just a super sub,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cHe\u2019s a superhero sub.\u201d 88 min Madueke hits the side netting at the other end. He\u2019s been a real threat since coming on, and if his decision making improves he could become a seriously good player. No clean sheet for Dean Henderson on his first England start. Walta curls a corner to the near post, where Hoskonen gets across Watkins and strains his neck muscles to force a header past Henderson. Not great defending from Ollie Watkins but Finland deserve that goal. 86 min Though England have been the better team, the scoreline is a little harsh on Finland. Fredrik Jensen missed two chances to equalise, the second a bit of a sitter, and at no stage have they been haemorrhaging chances. 85 min: England substitution Conor Gallagher comes on for Declan Rice. Declan Rice makes it three on the break. Watkins made good ground down the left, beat Hoskonen in the area and slid a good low cross towards the near post. Rice, who ran the length of the field in support just in case, touched the ball past Hradecky. That\u2019s his second goal in four games under Lee Carsley. 82 min: Finland substitution Oliver Antman comes on for Nikolai Alho, who had a good game at right wing-back. 81 min England break four on four. Grealish slips the ball down the left to Foden, who tries to find the unmarked Watkins at the far post. A Finland defender gets back to boot the ball over his own bar. 79 min Walta shoots over from 25 yards, with Henderson committing to a slightly weird dive after the ball has cleared the bar. England make two more substitutions: Phil Foden and Rico Lewis come on for Jude Bellingham and Angel Gomes. Both played pretty well and Gomes created Jack Grealish\u2019s goal with a lovely pass. 78 min Here\u2019s that terrific free-kick from Trent Alexander-Arnold. 77 min Bellingham shoots into the side netting from the edge of the area. Hradecky had it covered. 76 min \u201cI\u2019ve only been able to catch snippets of the game, but am intrigued to see Trent playing left back,\u201d says Dean Kinsella. \u201cHas it worked?\u201d Yes and no, which is the answer to pretty much any question about Alexander-Arnold when he plays for England. Some of his defending has been less than optimal but he played a part in the first goal and scored a majestic second. 75 min: Double substitution for Finland Teemu Puki and Robin Lod replace Topi Keskinen and Fredrik Jensen. That was a classic free-kick, whipped over the wall at pace and into the top corner. Hradecky got a touch as he flew to his right but couldn\u2019t keep it out. I don\u2019t think he could have done much more. A beautiful free-kick from Trent Alexander-Arnold seals victory for England. 73 min Bellingham dummies Walta neatly and is fouled 25 yards from goal. The free-kick is a fair way to the left of centre, with Alexander-Arnold over it\u2026 72 min \u201cThe mid-range football nations can get pretty far if they\u2019re well organised, and have a solid goalkeeper and a dangerous striker,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cThe Eagle-Owls have a clear way of playing, Hradecky is one of the best in the Bundesliga, but since Pukki got old, they lack a cutting edge. Pohjanpalo has been great for Venezia, but hasn\u2019t replicated that form for the national team.\u201d 71 min Madueke beats his man easily on the edge of the area and tries to give Watkins an open goal with an early cross. Hradecky throws himself at the ball and just manages to touch it away. 70 min Grealish runs at Alho to win a corner for England, who have had a whopping 78 per cent possession in the second half. 69 min: Double substitution for England Ollie Watkins and Noni Madueke come on for Harry Kane and Cole Palmer. Both men had quiet games. 65 min It sounds like Ollie Watkins is getting ready to come on for England, whose domination of this game is verging on the sterile. 64 min: Double substitution for Finland Leo Walta and Joel Pohjanpalo replace Rasmus Schuller and Fredrik Kallman. 63 min England continue to move the ball from side to side, looking for an opening. Grealish\u2019s goal is about the only time they have found an eye in the Finnish needle. 59 min Rice hits a powerful curler from 25 yards that is held by Hradecky, diving to his left. 57 min Bellingham escapes on the left at the other end and slides a low cross that is crucially cut out at the near post by Hradecky. Kane was waiting behind him and would have had an open goal. 56 min: Great chance for Jensen! Finland should be level. The chance came on the break after about five minutes of non-stop England possession. Keskinen lost Walker on the left side of the area and slide a precise low cross that was wafted over the bar by Jensen, barely six yards out. Replays show the ball bobbled but even so, that was a glorious chance. 54 min Palmer plays a good early ball to Kane, who releases Walker on the right. He has to wait for support and the move eventually peters out. 51 min And that\u2019s his second. Palmer hits an early shot through the crowd from the edge of the area, and Hradecky gets down well to his right to save. 50 min Alexander-Arnold whistles a decent effort from 30 yards that is held low to his right by Hradecky. That\u2019s his first save of the match. 47 min Finland break three on three after England lose the ball in midfield. Keskinen finds Kallman, who runs into trouble and is dispossessed. That was an opportunity. 46 min Peep peep! The second half is under way; no changes on either side. Half-time reading England lead through Jack Grealish\u2019s fourth goal for his country, made stylishly by Angel Gomes. They\u2019ve been good at times, sloppy at others, and a resourceful Finland side have had good chances of their own. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min Kallman\u2019s shot on the turn is saved by Henderson, though he was fractionally offside so it wouldn\u2019t have counted anyway. 43 min Bellingham overruns the ball in the area after receiving a sharp pass from Grealish on the left. That was half a chance. 42 min Finland have played well in the first half and been more competitive than most of us expected. 40 min Kallman heads over the bar after pulling off Guehi in the area. It was a difficult chance as the ball into him was played from a central position. 39 min \u201cHang on,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cAre we saying that you can\u2019t believe everything that\u2019s posted on Twitter?\u201d Politicians telling bald-faced lies is bad enough, but tactical misinformation is a new low for humanity. 38 min: Good chance for Jensen! A crossfield pass from left to right is headed back infield by Alho towards Jensen on the edge of the area. He runs through the challenge of Alexander-Arnold and splatters a half-volley over the bar. That was a really good opportunity. 36 min Most of England\u2019s threat has been on the left-hand side, with Grealish, Bellingham and Alexander-Arnold seeing a lot of the ball. 35 min Bellingham, on the left, pings a terrific flat pass over the defence to find Rice in the area. He controls the ball in mid-air, inadvertently wrongfoots a defender in the process and has a snapshot that is blocked by a second defender and goes behind for a corner. 33 min Then England lose the ball and Finland break. The lively Keskinen runs at Stones and shoots straight at Henderson from the edge of the area. 32 min England keep the ball for 90 seconds or so to calm everything down. It does feel like they have another gear or two should they need them. 30 min \u201cSome insider info: Finland was planning to play with a back five all along,\u201d says Antti Vanhoja. \u201cThe commentators on Finnish TV were aware of the ruse and revealed it to the audience already before kick-off. A cunning plan, though not very effective.\u201d It\u2019s a big sad that the culture of marginal gains has extended to deliberately putting your team in the wrong formation when you post it on Twitter, but you see it happen all the time. 29 min Keskinen\u2019s shot takes a deflection off Walker and spins behind for a corner. Finland are having a good spell. 29 min Play resumes and Jensen has a shot on the turn from about 20 yards that is blocked. Gomes seems okay for now. 28 min There\u2019s a break in play while Gomes receives treatment. It looks like he strained something while trying to challenge Jensen. 25 min Keskinen gets away from Walker and pings a decent cross into the middle. Kallman is the only Finland player in the box, however, and it\u2019s nowhere near him. 23 min Grealish and Bellingham are combining a lot in the inside-left channel. England could still do with an overlapping left-back, but they have what they have. 23 min \u201cAll this messing with Trent isn\u2019t doing him, or the team any good,\u201d says Colum Farrelly. \u201cPlay him at right back. Or, in the absence of a fit left back, play him at left back. But omit the right-back-with-a-bit-of-midfielder, the left-back-with-free-role (wha?) and if he\u2019s not playing well, don\u2019t play him. Then he\u2019ll know what he\u2019s supposed to do and have a chance to do it well.\u201d 21 min The last man Guehi shows excellent pace to beat Alho to a long ball forward. He looks very assured at this level. 19 min I know it\u2019s only Nations League Group B2, but that eye-of-the-needle pass from Gomes was very classy. Jack Grealish gets his second goal under Lee Carsley. Alexander-Arnold played a short pass into Gomes, 25 yards from goal. He controlled it on the half turn and flicked a gorgeous through ball for Grealish, who timed his run perfectly and passed the ball under Hradecky. Jack\u2019s back. 17 min Jensen is penalised for a challenge on Bellingham, complains to the referee and receives an extravagant, arm-waving reprimand. You had to be there. 15 min Finland have done well so far to deny England space in the final third. It helps that England\u2019s play has been quite relatively narrow. I do think that\u2019s a problem the new manager needs to address. 13 min Incidentally, Topi Keskinen, who almost gave Finland the lead in the seventh minute, has a tattoo of Wayne Rooney on his person. 11 min A corner from Palmer is only half cleared by Finland. Alexander-Arnold walks onto the ball, 25 yards from goal, and hits a low drive that is kicked away. He didn\u2019t catch it perfectly and looks frustrated with himself. 10 min The first bit of really good play from England. Grealish slides a crisp return pass into Bellingham on the edge of the area. He twists Jensen (I think) one way and then the other before hitting a shot that deflects off Jensen and spins behind for a corner. 8 min Now England almost get into trouble when Alexander-Arnold gives the ball away. A couple of moments of sloppiness from England. 7 min: Chance for Finland! All that passing from England and it\u2019s Finland who almost take the lead. Gomes gave the ball away to Kamara, and seconds later Stones had to make a desperate sliding block from Kallman\u2019s shot. The ball ran loose to Keskinen, who mishit his shot wide of the near post. 4 min Loads of early possession for England, which comes as no surprise. Trent Alexander-Arnold is almost playing as a left-back with a free role. Imagine if you\u2019d pitched that idea to Jackie Charlton in the 1990s. 1 min Peep peep! England, in their dark raisin/sesame (sic) change strip, kick off from right to left as we watch. Finland have started with a back five, not the advertised 4-3-3. They literally lied on their Twitter feed. As the players stroll onto the field, here\u2019s a reminder of the two teams. Finland (possible 4-3-3) Hradecky; Alho, Hoskonen, Ivanov, Uronen; Kamara, Schuller, Peltola; F Jensen, Kallman, Keskinen. Substitutes: Joronen, Sinisalo, Galvez, Antman, Lod, Pukki, Stahl, Pikkarainen, Tenho, Nissila, Pohjanpalo, Walta. England (possible 4-2-3-1) Henderson; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Alexander-Arnold; Gomes, Rice; Palmer, Bellingham, Grealish; Kane.

A bit of pre-match reading Finland manager Markku Kanerva speaks to ITV We want to give our fans a spectacular match. We know how tough it\u2019s going to be but we\u2019re ready to make a miracle. We have to defend well for 90+ minutes, be very solid and compact, and take care of the ball when we have it. \u201cInteresting quote from Carsley on wanting to try something different,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cIs that a coded way of saying it was an object lesson to all those that thought Southgate was too stodgy and conservative?\u201d I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s how he works. I suspect it was more in the spirit of the England cricket team, testing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. That\u2019s quite admirable because he\u2019s smart enough to have known what was coming if it went wrong. England\u2019s Nations League campaign concludes in November with matches against Greece (A) and Ireland (H), then the speculation about Gareth Southgate\u2019s successor will really begin. That\u2019ll be fun. Remember when Lee Carsley speaks to ITV It\u2019s fair to say we fell below the levels that we expect. We can use it as a real positive now with a good response tonight. [On Dean Henderson\u2019s selection] It was always the case we we were gonna look at Dean in one of the games. [On Trent Alexander-Arnold at left-back] His role will be a bit different to a conventional left-back. He\u2019s very versatile and we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in him. [On the reaction to Thursday\u2019s defeat] I\u2019m absolutely fine. It was something I was expecting \u2013 I wanted to try something different and I take full responsibility. If I had my time again I\u2019d do exactly the same. Jonathan Liew on England For years the focus of England\u2019s cultural development has been on how we can keep these guys happy, in an era where the rewards and prestige are ever more severely weighted towards club football. This was one of Gareth Southgate\u2019s great achievements, and by the end even he seemed a little lost in the cosmos, desperately trying to keep the circus on the road, a cast of stars all convinced they were possessed of some unique main-character energy. When it works, your stars step up at crucial moments to drag you to a major final you had no business being in. But the problem with this model is that effort becomes contingent on circumstances. Euro semi-final: fine. Uefa Nations League group B2 in October: good luck with that. Which is why a certain arrogance, a certain caprice, seems to have crept into the setup. Poor bloke probably can\u2019t wait to get back to the under-21s. All change in the England team, with Lee Carsley reverting to a more familiar 4-2-3-1 formation. Harry Kane, Marc Guehi, Kyle Walker, Angel Gomes, Jack Grealish and Dean Henderson replace Phil Foden, Levi Colwill, Rico Lewis, Jordan Pickford, Anthony Gordon and Bukayo Saka. That means either Walker or, more likely, Trent Alexander-Arnold will start at left-back. Finland have made five changes to the side that lost at home to Ireland on Thursday. Finland (possible 4-3-3) Hradecky; Alho, Hoskonen, Ivanov, Uronen; Kamara, Schuller, Peltola; F Jensen, Kallman, Keskinen. Substitutes: Joronen, Sinisalo, Galvez, Antman, Lod, Pukki, Stahl, Pikkarainen, Tenho, Nissila, Pohjanpalo, Walta. England (possible 4-2-3-1) Henderson; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Alexander-Arnold; Gomes, Rice; Palmer, Bellingham, Grealish; Kane. Substitutes: Pickford, Pope, Lewis, Foden, Gordon, Gallagher, Colwill, Livramento, Watkins, Solanke, Madueke. Referee Giorgi Kruashvili (Georgia). The difference a game makes. There was plenty of goodwill towards Lee Carsley after his first window as England\u2019s interim manager, with the BBC among those surmising that the job was his to lose. All that goodwill evaporated on Thursday night, when England were beaten by Greece after Carsley picked an, a-hem, experimental XI that inccluded five forwards and no striker. Carsley was praised by many before the game for letting England\u2019s hair down, then ridiculed after it for being a bald fraud. And while it\u2019s almost entirely unfair, Carsley\u2019s distinguished England coaching career will probably now be remembered for the night he gambled on a 4-1-5-0 formation. \u201cYou want the public to trust and love the team,\u201d said Carsley, \u201cbecause the impact the national team has on the public is very inspiring. We know we can do a lot better. You have to respect people\u2019s opinions and we didn\u2019t perform as well as we can and I would expect a reaction against Finland.\u201d England will pick a more conventional team in Finland, with Harry Kane likely to return up front, and they yet could end the day joint-top of Group B2. That would require the Republic of Ireland to win in Greece but, as England know all too well, stranger things have happened. Kick off 5pm.",

And no one should underestimate the impact the BBC has had in the global news landscape to this point \u2013 as an entirely independent force \u2026\u201d During his Monday afternoon speech, Davie will also discuss the impact and growth of news outlets controlled by Russia and China, and how they are outspending BBC investment \u201cby a multiple of thousands\u201d. \u201cTogether they are spending an estimated \u00a36-8bn on expanding their global media activities \u2013 investing hard to grow their audiences in key markets in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America,\u201d he will say. \u201cAcross Africa in particular, Russian media is incredibly active in promoting its narratives, with social media influencers amplifying propaganda and so-called \u2018activists\u2019 live-streaming pro-Russia rallies. \u201cAnd this investment is seeing significant returns, not only in terms of the reach of Russian state broadcaster RT and China\u2019s CGTN, but also in terms of trust.\u201d In his speech, Davie will discuss how other companies have filled the \u201cgaps\u201d the BBC left in Africa after its \u201cretreat\u201d. \u201cKenya\u2019s state broadcaster KBC has taken up Chinese output on TV and radio, as has Liberia\u2019s state broadcaster LBS,\u201d he will say. \u201cMeanwhile, in Lebanon, Russian-backed media is now transmitting on the radio frequency previously occupied by BBC Arabic. \u201cLast month, our outstanding BBC Monitoring teams listened in to that Russian output on the day thousands of pagers and radio devices exploded. What they heard was unchallenged propaganda and narratives being delivered to local communities. \u201cHad the BBC been able to retain our impartial radio output, these messages would have been much harder for local audiences to find. In this context, the further retreat of the BBC World Service should be a cause for serious global concern.\u201d In 2022, the BBC announced the proposed closure of about 382 posts at the World Service as well as the closure of its Arabic and Persian radio services. In April an inquiry was launched into the future funding of the service, focusing on the corporation\u2019s influence as a soft power and establishing whether increased government support was needed. The World Service is the BBC\u2019s international broadcaster and is predominantly funded by the UK licence fee. It receives additional grant funding of \u00a3104.4m from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Under its current support package, the World Service has agreed not to close any language services, but this condition is set to be lifted in 2025.",

However, the world champions do have a few injury concerns that leave them a smidge more vulnerable. </p> <p>Pace bowler Tayla Vlaeminck has a dislocated right shoulder, suffered after only four balls in their eventual win against Pakistan and captain Alyssa Healy was forced to hobble off the field towards the end of the match with an \u201cacute\u201d injury to her right foot. </p> <p>Healy\u2019s prognosis for the rest of the tournament should become clear soon after she was sent for scans yesterday. Vlaeminck\u2019s injury is a particularly cruel blow as the fast bowler has been plagued with injury and was playing only her second World Cup match and first since 2018. her teammates were visibly upset when she went down and it became clear she could not continue. </p> <p>The Aussies have remarkable strength in depth but won\u2019t take India lightly, they have yet another world trophy in their sights. If India win by less than 61 runs then they\u2019ll be looking nervously to New Zealand\u2019s match against Pakistan and a host of net run rate outcomes that, to be perfectly honest, make my brain rattle. We\u2019ll cross that numerical bridge when and if we come to it. </p> <p>Play gets underway at 6pm local time, 1am AEDT time and 3pm where I am in dear old blighty. I\u2019ll be back with news of the teams and the toss when they filter through.

      "bodyText": "Righto, that\u2019s enough from me. Thanks for your company, the OBO will return\u2026 That was an impressive performance from Australia who were up against it with injuries. They withstood pressure with the bat to post a decent total and were suffocating with the ball and in the field. They go through to the semi-finals with an unbeaten run through the group stage. You didn\u2019t expect anything else did you? Sophie Molineux scoops Player of the Match for her 2-32: It was a really good game. India came out hard and it went down the wire. We held our nerve. I think we just wanted to stay calm. All the senior players stepped up and we just went back to basics. It was very loud, the crowd were very one-sided towards India but it\u2019s cool. A lot of our players have experienced this, any game against India, you mark it in your calendar, it\u2019s going to be massive (the semi-final). It\u2019s about momentum for us now.\u201d Crikes. Four wickets in the final over! India came close at the last but left themselves with too much to do in the end. Australia book their spot in the semi-final and India will have a nervy wait to see if they progress ahead of New Zealand on - your friend and mine \u2013 net run rate. Are you keeping up with this? Am I? 19.5 overs: Shreyanka is run out off a leg-side wide! 19.4 overs: Kaur can only get a single. That could be Goodnight Viennetta. Reddy sacrifices herself in order to get Harmanpreet Kaur back on strike. India need 13 from 3. What were you worried about? Sutherland goes full and Harmanpreet can only get a single down the ground. Bowled! Vastrakar is cleaned up off the next one and it is a crucial dot. India need 13 from 4 balls. Annabel Sutherland is going to bowl the final over. Deep breaths. 19th over: India 138-5 (Harmanpreet 52, Vastrakar 9) Sophie Molineux to bowl the penultimate over. Vastrakar carves past point for four to put the pressure on the bowler. A full ball is luckily edged away fine by Kaur to take her to 49. She picks up two over cover to go to fifty and doesn\u2019t even acknowledge it, she\u2019s in the zone! A single off the last ball means that Harmanpreet Kaur will be on strike for the final over \u2013 India need 14 from six balls. Exactly what they\u2019ve just scored off this one. 18th over: India 124-5 (Harmanpreet 45, Vastrakar 2) Now then! Harmanpreet hits back to back boundaries through the off side off Ash Gardner to keep India ticking. Just. 28 needed from 12! 17th over: India 112-5 (Harmanpreet 35, Vastrakar 0) Disastrous over for India, just a single and the wicket off it as Megan Schutt\u2019s up shop for the Aussies. (Sorry) Direct hit! Gone! Ghosh taps to cover and sets off but Litchfield is a dead eye, she has a stump and a half to aim at and splatters them with a flat throw. 16th over: India 111-4 (Harmanpreet 34, Ghosh 1) Richa Ghosh is the new batter, she scampers a single to get off the mark from her first ball. India need 41 from 24 balls, they\u2019ve still got Harmanpreet Kaur at the crease and she is well set. Loins girded for a tight finish? India finally show some real intent, both Kaur and Sharma finding the fence off Molineux. The left arm spinner has the last laugh though as Sharma heaves her away straight to Georgia Wareham on the square leg boundary rope. 15th over: India 99-3 (Harmanpreet 25, Sharma 27) Georgia Wareham gets it all wrong and flings down a waist high full toss. Called a No Ball, rightly so, Kaur can\u2019t connect with the free hit and it\u2019s just a single. Deepti Sharma sweeps the final ball of the over past fine leg for four. India clinging on. 53 from 30 needed and the fifty partnership up for Sharma and Kaur. 14th over: India 90-3 (Harmanpreet 25, Sharma 19) Ash Gardner back for her third over, singles off the first four deliveries, India need to find the fence! Ah, there we go. Sweet release as Kaur pulls a short ball to the square leg fence. 13th over: India 82-3 (Harmanpreet 19, Sharma 17) Australia are well and truly putting the squeeze on, India\u2019s eyes bulging in the green and gold constrictor coils. Just three runs off Sutherland. 70 runs needed from 42 balls. 12th over: India 79-3 (Harmanpreet 17, Sharma 16) Wareham is picked off for four singles off the over which serves only to lump more pressure on India. Kaur has 17 off 21 balls and needs to put her foot down. Thelma. Louise. Harmanpreet. 11th over: India 75-3 (Harmanpreet 15, Sharma 14) Righto. India need 85 runs from the remaining 60 balls. Australia officially qualify for the semi finals as the over ticks past the halfway mark, no matter what the result. So India and New Zealand are vying for the final semi spot from Group A. Darcie Brown is given the nod by McGrath, a short ball is swivelled away for four by Harmanpreet and four more singles are collected off the over, eight in total off it. 10th over: India 67-3 (Harmanpreet 9, Sharma 12) Molineux dusts herself down and comes back on for her second over. Harmanpreet tries to ramp but doesn\u2019t connect, dots are deadly for India. Eeeesht! Shades of Sarah Taylor\u2019s great catch down the leg side as Beth Mooney anticipates a lap sweep and heads off to try and haul it in with a dive. Sharp thinking and excellent effort but the ball just went too wide in the end. Just four runs off the over, not enough. Time for a drink, India need a splosh of rocket fuel in their squash. Here is that Sarah Taylor masterpiece, enjoy. 9th over: India 63-3 (Harmanpreet 7, Sharma 9) Sutherland returns and keeps things tight for Australia, India can only work for singles. With the run rate rising Sharma swipes into the air on the leg side and narrowly evades the diving fielder, still only a single results. DROP! Sutherland sends down a looooopy slower ball that Sharma frying pans to backward point, Sophie Molineux dives to her weaker side but can\u2019t cling on. Sharma survives. India need 89 runs from 66 balls. 8th over: India 57-3 (Harmanpreet 4, Sharma 7) Georgia Wareham into the attack, she gets away with a full bunger first ball, Sharma clubbing it to the fielder in the ring. A couple of singles worked down the ground are followed by a sweep for four by Sharma, a gossamer tickle off the glove is enough to divert the ball past Mooney behind the stumps. 7th over: India 48-3 (Harmanpreet 2, Sharma 1) Deepti Sharma joins her captain in the middle. At the very least India need to take this as close as they can in order to maximise their chances of progressing on NRR. A pounding will basically see them knocked out of the tournament. The required rate climbs to eight an over\u2026 the pressure cooker hisses in Sharjah. Rodrigues slams Schutt away through the leg side on the pull for four at the start of the over and is then dismissed trying to replicate the shot a few balls later! Rodrigues hit it hard and flat but straight into the safe hands of Ash Gardner on the boundary sponge, she don\u2019t drop those. 6th over: India 41-1 (Rodrigues 11, Harmanpreet 1) Molineux is accurate, she gets out of the over for the cost of just two runs and pocketed the wicket of Mandhana, her RCB captain in the WPL. Harmanpreet arrives in the middle with plenty to do for her side. Sophie Molineux into the attack with her left arm spin and she picks up the big wicket of Mandhana with her first ball! A poor shot from the opener in truth, a good length delivery that she tried to hack away across the line, missing it and being trapped in front. India did not need that. 5th over: India 39-1 (Mandhana 6, Rodrigues 10) Jemimah Rodrigues comes to the party! She advance down the wicket to Annabel Sutherland and turns a length ball into a half volley, driving down the ground for four. Next ball Rodrigues stays stock still and bunts Sutherland back over her head for four more! Ten runs off the over, don\u2019t count India out just yet. Verma tries to go big again but doesn\u2019t get enough on the shot, she\u2019s caught on the long on boundary. Ash Gardner picks her up for the FIFTH time in T20I cricket. Bright Eyes, Burning Like Fire. Rabbit, innit. Rodrigues is the new batter, three singles finish the over as Australia curtail India\u2019s fast start. 4th over: India 29-1 (Mandhana 5, Rodrigues 2) 3rd over: India 25-0 (Mandhana 3, Verma 20) Beth Mooney is keeping wicket for Australia in Healy\u2019s absence. She has front row seats for Shafali Verma smoking Schutt back over her head for four and then timing a full ball away over the off side for a sweetly struck SIX! 2nd over: India 13-0 (Mandhana 3, Verma 10) Ash Gardner from t\u2019other end. Verma drives down the ground for a couple and then works a single. Mandhana returns the favour to give Verma the last ball\u2026 which she duly clobbers away over square leg for four! 1st over: India 5-0 (Mandhana 2, Verma 3) Megan Schutt to open the bowling for Australia. FYI \u2013 India need to get the runs inside 10.2 overs if they are to leapfrog Australia\u2026 I know I know but I have to tell you these things. Australia work five runs off the first over as my toddler waddles in to tell me off for some perceived indiscretion. She\u2019s in her eighth straight hour of pretending to be a teacher. Daniel Day Lewis eat your heart out. Phoebe Litchfield spanks the final ball of the innings over square on the leg side for SIX! A beaut of a slog sweep sees Australia get to 150 in the end. A topsy turvy innings, India will need to post 152 runs to win and keep their tournament hopes alive. 20th over: Australia 151-8 (Litchfield 15, Schutt 0) Confusion! Sophie Molineux pats her first ball in the air to Jemimah Rodrigues at point and believes she has been caught out. The batter starts to walk off but Rodrigues actually spilled the chance. Fair play to the fielder though, she recovered quickly and had the presence of mind to enact the run out. Slightly dozy cricket from Molineux. One ball of the innings to go\u2026 Shreyanka Patil to bowl the final over. Sutherland charges and drives down the ground for four but then tries to repeat the shot and is comprehensively bowled! 19th over: Australia 139-6 (Litchfield 9, Sutherland 5) Annabel Sutherland is the new batter, she whips her very first ball from Sharma off her pads for four past fine leg. Sutherland takes a single off the final ball of the over to keep strike for the last. What can the Aussies post from here? Ellyse Perry departs after clubbing straight to sub fielder Sajana on the leg side boundary, the ball was middles and was travelling so it was a decent catch on the sponge. 18th over: Australia 132-5 (Perry 31, Litchfield 8) Five singles rotated off Yadav\u2019s second over but it is bad news for India as they\u2019ve been too slow at bowling their overs and won\u2019t be allowed to have all of their allotted players out outside the ring for the final two overs. This match slipping away from them\u2026 17th over: Australia 127-5 (Perry 28, Litchfield 6) Another good over for Australia, twelve runs off it as Phoebe Litchfield clears her front leg and drives Deepti Sharma down the ground for four. Umpire Redfern then raises the finger to give Litchfield out lbw off an attempted reverse hit but Australia review and the decision comes back not out as the ball is still deemed to have pitched outside leg even though the batter was attempting a reverse-hit. There\u2019s some confusion out there, I might have to dust off the law book too. On we go, Perry clears the mind and pulls as Sharma short ball away for four more. Australia finishing strongly, they\u2019ll be looking at a target of 150/160 from here. 16th over: Australia 115-5 (Perry 21, Litchfield 1) Shreyanka Patil drags down and Ellyse Perry punishes her, rocking back and hitting through the leg side for four. SIX! Perry then hits the first Aussie six of the evening, dancing down and hitting high and long over the midwicket rope. Fourteen runs in total off the over as Australia plunder precious runs. 15th over: Australia 101-5 (Perry 8, Litchfield) India keep taking wickets, Phoebe Litchfield is the new batter. Ash Gardner hits a four straight down the ground but then perishes to the short ball! Vastrakar drags her length back and Gardner swipes into the air to cover. 14th over: Australia 95-4 (Perry 7, Gardner 1) Ash Gardner arrives in the middle and nearly ploops a return catch straight back to Sharma off her first ball! The ball flew just wide of the bowler in her follow through and the batters scamper a single. Perry cuts away for two but the over belongs to India - just four runs and the wicket of Harris off it. Harris plinks Deepti Sharma straight to mid on! Tame dismissal in the end. Both set batters back in the hutch for Australia as India hit back. 13th over: Australia 95-4 (Harris 40, Perry 4) Grace Harris gives the Aussie run rate a welcome shot in the arm with two boundaries off the over. A thump over mid-off is followed by a freebie on the leg stump from Arundhati Reddy that is clubbed behind square. 12th over: Australia 80-3 (Harris 32, Perry 1) Ellyse Perry arrives at the crease. She can sometimes be a slow starter but Australia can ill afford her to chew up too many deliveries. Off the mark first ball with a drive to deep cover. Huge drop! Harmanpreet Kaur shells Tahlia McGrath at mid off off the bowling of Radha Yadav and hangs her head in her hands instead. How costly will that be\u2026 NOT VERY! Radha Yadav fires one past McGrath as she advances and lines up a wild swing, Richa Ghosh does the honours behind the sticks to enact a neat stumping. McGrath was looking to put her foot down and India are very glad to see the back of her. 11th over: Australia 71-2 (Harris 31, McGrath 25) Australia have recovered well from the early losses of Mooney and Wareham but will still want plenty more. Luckily for them they\u2019ve got the impressive engine room of Perry, Gardner, Litchfield and Sutherland to come. Renuka Singh returns for her final over, can she find another breakthrough\u2026 nearly \u2013 she scuds one into McGrath\u2019s pads off her final delivery and impores umpire Sue Redfern to raise the finger. It looked a close one. The umpires says no and India go upstairs. Good decision from the umpire, the ball was just slipping past leg stump. Renuka Singh finishes with 2-24 from her four overs. 10th over: Australia 65-2 (Harris 27, McGrath 24) Deepti Sharma summoned by Harmanpreet and her first over is good one, nagging line on the stumps and only five runs off the over. We\u2019re halfway through the Aussie innings and it\u2019s time for a drink. Milk, no sugar. Ta. 9th over: Australia 60-2 (Harris 25, McGrath 21) Drop! Deepti Sharma shells a low chance from Harris at backward point, the momentum beginning to change in this game. McGrath dances down and lofts Arundhati over mid off for four as the Aussie partnership grows. 8th over: Australia 52-2 (Harris 24, McGrath 14) Vastrakar returns and very nearly cleans up McGrath with one that nips back late. India decide against the review, it looked a little high, the replays show it was umpires call and the decision on field was not out. Prettay prettay close though. Shot! McGrath charges the next ball and drives on the up through point for four. Vastrakar responds with a bouncer that McGrath ducks. A single to cover brings Harris on strike for the final ball of the over. Nicely played! A pre-meditated dab from Harris is well executed and runs away fine for the second boundary of the over. Ten runs off it. 7th over: Australia 42-2 (Harris 19, McGrath 9) Arundhati Reddy given the nod and sends down another tight over, just five singles off it as Australia can\u2019t break the shackles. The Aussies have patted back 22 dots so far, that gives a decent indication of how well the Indian bowlers have bowled and fielded so far. 6th over: Australia 37-2 (Harris 16, McGrath 7) Shreyanka Patil to bowl the final over of the powerplay. Bosh! Harris greets her with a heave over midwicket that bounces once before hitting the boundary hoardings. Patil responds well though, darting the ball in at the stumps and not giving Harris the chance to get under it. Two leg byes and single the only further damage. Cat and mouse stuff. 5th over: Australia 30-2 (Harris 11, McGrath 7) Grace Harris lines up a smear into the leg side but misses it and the ball nearly cleans up her leg stump. Ghosh missed it too and the batters scrabble a single. Renuka Singh is looking for the lbw again but strays a bit too straight an is worked away into the leg side by both batters. Six runs off the over. 4th over: Australia 24-2 (Harris 10, McGrath 5) Pooja Vastrakar into the attack for India. Medium pace and shaping way from the right hander. McGrath punches through cover for a single to get off the mark and then finishers the over with clip of the pads fine for four. Australia have Ellyse Perry to come in next, they are in the middle of a re-build job here, India are buzzing about after the early breakthroughs, could this be their night\u2026? 3rd over: Australia 18-2 (Harris 9, McGrath 0) Stand in captain Tahlia McGrath arrives at the crease with her team in srtrife. Can she survive the hat-trick ball from Renuka\u2026 just! The ball was arrowed in at the pads once more but was a bit too leg side, McGrath scampering a leg bye to get down the other end and keep strike for the next over. Two wickets for Renuka and India putting the Aussies under the pump in Sharjah. Stone. Dead. Wareham is pinned lbw first ball and Renuka Singh is on a hat-trick! Mooney cuts away uppishly and is well caught by the last minute replacement Radha Yadav, diving forward to scoop the ball up just before it hit the turf. Fine grab and India have their first! Gah! Renuka slides one down the leg side and leaves Ghosh with no chance behind the stumps as the ball races away for five wides\u2026 but hang on a minute\u2026 There\u2019s been a late swap to the India XI: Radha Yadav has come in for Asha Sobhana. I only just saw this. Finger meet pulse. 2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Harris 7, Mooney 1) Shreyanka Patil from the other end with her wily off-breaks. She starts well, pinning Mooney on the pads with an arm-ball and getting plenty of drift and spin when she flights it. Just a single to each batter, the floodlights beat down in Sharjah and it looks very clammy out there. 1st over: Australia 7-0 (Harris 6, Mooney 0) India\u2019s wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh is up to the stumps and there\u2019s a slip in place too. Renuka is on the money first ball but strays short and wide with her second, Harris does not miss out, rocking back and spanking through point for four! A drop? Renuka spears one down the leg side and I think Harris got a tickle on it, Ghosh spills it and the umpire tellingly does not give a wide. They stick or they don\u2019t\u2026 and that one didn\u2019t. Harris clips for a couple off her pads to make it seven runs off the first. Right then, the players are heading out for the anthems, Grace Harris and Beth Mooney are opening up for the Aussies. Renuka Singh is going to open the bowling for India. The actual fireworks go off and maybe we\u2019re about to see some more metaphorical ones. Play! Not looking good for Alyssa Healy and Tayla Vlaeminck\u2019s tournament is over. You know it, I know it \u2013 sport is a cruel so and so sometimes. Here\u2019s one England prepared earlier: Heather Knight\u2019s side booked their place in the semi-finals with a ten wicket victory over Scotland and - whisper it \u2013 are seemingly peeking at the right time for a tilt at the trophy. Teams: Grace Harris and Darcie Brown are back in the side for Australia. Pooja Vastrakar is back in the XI for India. It\u2019s a still sweltering 34 degrees in Sharjah with the temperature set to drop as evening sets in. Perhaps dew will play a part later on in proceedings\u2026 India: 1 Shafali Verma, 2 Smriti Mandhana, 3 Harmanpreet Kaur (C), 4 Jemimah Rodriguez, 5 Richa Ghosh (wk), 6 Deepti Sharma, 7 Pooja Vastrakar, 8 Arundhati Reddy, 9 Shreyanka Patil, 10 Asha Sobhana, 11 Renuka Singh Australia: 1 Beth Mooney (wk), 2 Grace Harris , 3 Ellyse Perry, 4 Ashleigh Gardner, 5 Phoebe Litchfield, 6 Tahlia McGrath (C), 7 Georgia Wareham, 8 Annabel Sutherland, 9 Sophie Molineux, 10 Megan Schutt, 11 Darcie Brown The news is confirmed that Alyssa Healy is out of action for Australia, she\u2019s even sporting crutches so it doesn\u2019t look good for the rest of the tournament. Thalia McGrath takes the captaincy reins with the incredibly experienced Ellyse Perry as her deputy, her first act is a succesful one, she wins the toss and decides to have a bat. Hello and welcome to the OBO of Australia v India from Sharjah. There\u2019s a place in the T20 World Cup semi-final at stake and Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s side have it all to do. In order to progress they\u2019ll need to jam a stick in the spokes of one of the greatest sides to grace world cricket, and that is not hyperbole. An India win of 61 runs or more will see them leapfrog the Aussies and qualify automatically for the final four but that would be some turn up for the books as India have only won eight of the 34 T20 matches they\u2019ve played against the Aussies. However, the world champions do have a few injury concerns that leave them a smidge more vulnerable. Pace bowler Tayla Vlaeminck has a dislocated right shoulder, suffered after only four balls in their eventual win against Pakistan and captain Alyssa Healy was forced to hobble off the field towards the end of the match with an \u201cacute\u201d injury to her right foot. Healy\u2019s prognosis for the rest of the tournament should become clear soon after she was sent for scans yesterday. Vlaeminck\u2019s injury is a particularly cruel blow as the fast bowler has been plagued with injury and was playing only her second World Cup match and first since 2018. her teammates were visibly upset when she went down and it became clear she could not continue. The Aussies have remarkable strength in depth but won\u2019t take India lightly, they have yet another world trophy in their sights. If India win by less than 61 runs then they\u2019ll be looking nervously to New Zealand\u2019s match against Pakistan and a host of net run rate outcomes that, to be perfectly honest, make my brain rattle. We\u2019ll cross that numerical bridge when and if we come to it. Play gets underway at 6pm local time, 1am AEDT time and 3pm where I am in dear old blighty. I\u2019ll be back with news of the teams and the toss when they filter through. Please do drop me a line with any thoughts and theories, the (ludicrously?) capacious OBO mailbag is open.",

      "body": "<p>It is Sunday afternoon in the Cowbridge Suite of the Vale Resort on the outskirts of Cardiff, base camp for Wales, and the pre\u2011Montenegro press conference is 23 minutes old when the last question, about playing long, is put to Craig Bellamy. Most managers would be minded to wrap things up. Then again, Bellamy is not a most managers kind of character. \u201cI like to give you a fair fight,\u201d he says, his words lingering for a second or two. He is only getting started, as a five-minute soliloquy provides an absorbing insight into his deep and complex psyche.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want people coming off feeling like I did, and that\u2019s the honest truth,\u201d the 45-year-old says. \u201cI want you to love this [playing for Wales], I want you to come away thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to play again. It might not have been our day but I felt like I had a chance of scoring, I had so much of the ball.\u2019 So many times when I came off it was so difficult. Against the Republic of Ireland [in 2007], I cried. I touched the ball three times. I\u2019m at Croke&nbsp;Park. No one came and spoke to me and said: \u2018Sorry for leaving you on your own up there [in attack].\u2019 I never want anyone to feel that way. I believe we should give everybody a chance at being able to&nbsp;show their true talent.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/12/fast-starts-and-a-licence-to-thrill-wales-warming-to-project-bellamy\">Fast starts and a licence to thrill: Wales warming to Project Bellamy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By this point Bellamy had already touched on the allure of Joe Allen\u2019s return to the Wales setup. \u201cWe all love romance, no? Hopefully he kicks the ball for me [against Montenegro].\u201d Then he moved on to expectations, not wanting to temper excitement among the supporters, and his unwavering belief in his possession-based plan. \u201cWe should enjoy this. This country over the last years has given us reasons to be optimistic. I\u2019ve watched us in major tournaments. We got to the semi\u2011finals with Cookie [Chris Coleman at Euro 2016], then the Euros with Pagey [Rob Page in 2021], a World Cup [in 2022], it\u2019s been incredible for us. Now we want to keep that going. And I&nbsp;believe there\u2019s a really good chance of being able to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Bellamy apologised for trailing off and talking \u201cnonsense for 20\u2011odd minutes\u201d but he made a series of serious points, none more so than when discussing the dearth of options at the base of midfield. Aaron Ramsey and Ethan Ampadu are injured, Jordan James is suspended and Allen, the 34-year-old who returned to the international fold this month after retiring last year, has yet to start a game this season. Bellamy conceded starting Allen against Montenegro would be a gamble. Josh Sheehan, of League One Bolton, could partner Allen\u2019s Swansea clubmate Oli Cooper in midfield. </p> <p>\u201cWe are light in the No&nbsp;6 area, and that\u2019s through all the age groups,\u201d Bellamy said. </p> <p>\u201cWe are a nation that sometimes has to be creative in what we do and sometimes that adds to your strengths. We\u2019ve seen bigger nations than ours really struggle in that area. It\u2019s a really important area for how we play. We just have to get on with it. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how one or two others get on.\u201d</p> <p>After all, these days the absences of important players \u2013 the in-form Brennan Johnson is also suspended \u2013 are not enough to dampen expectations. Ben Davies, who will captain Wales again with Ramsey missing, concedes they went \u201csky high\u201d after impressing against Turkey in Bellamy\u2019s first match. \u201cExpectations are made off the back of what we have done in the past,\u201d Davies says. </p> <p>\u201cThere was a time when Wales didn\u2019t qualify for any major tournaments and we were probably going into campaigns expecting to get nowhere near it. We want that expectation. We don\u2019t want a bit of luck to get to competitions. We want to push and play at the highest level.

      "bodyText": "It is Sunday afternoon in the Cowbridge Suite of the Vale Resort on the outskirts of Cardiff, base camp for Wales, and the pre\u2011Montenegro press conference is 23 minutes old when the last question, about playing long, is put to Craig Bellamy. Most managers would be minded to wrap things up. Then again, Bellamy is not a most managers kind of character. \u201cI like to give you a fair fight,\u201d he says, his words lingering for a second or two. He is only getting started, as a five-minute soliloquy provides an absorbing insight into his deep and complex psyche. \u201cI don\u2019t want people coming off feeling like I did, and that\u2019s the honest truth,\u201d the 45-year-old says. \u201cI want you to love this [playing for Wales], I want you to come away thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to play again. It might not have been our day but I felt like I had a chance of scoring, I had so much of the ball.\u2019 So many times when I came off it was so difficult. Against the Republic of Ireland [in 2007], I cried. I touched the ball three times. I\u2019m at Croke Park. No one came and spoke to me and said: \u2018Sorry for leaving you on your own up there [in attack].\u2019 I never want anyone to feel that way. I believe we should give everybody a chance at being able to show their true talent.\u201d By this point Bellamy had already touched on the allure of Joe Allen\u2019s return to the Wales setup. \u201cWe all love romance, no? Hopefully he kicks the ball for me [against Montenegro].\u201d Then he moved on to expectations, not wanting to temper excitement among the supporters, and his unwavering belief in his possession-based plan. \u201cWe should enjoy this. This country over the last years has given us reasons to be optimistic. I\u2019ve watched us in major tournaments. We got to the semi\u2011finals with Cookie [Chris Coleman at Euro 2016], then the Euros with Pagey [Rob Page in 2021], a World Cup [in 2022], it\u2019s been incredible for us. Now we want to keep that going. And I believe there\u2019s a really good chance of being able to do that.\u201d Bellamy apologised for trailing off and talking \u201cnonsense for 20\u2011odd minutes\u201d but he made a series of serious points, none more so than when discussing the dearth of options at the base of midfield. Aaron Ramsey and Ethan Ampadu are injured, Jordan James is suspended and Allen, the 34-year-old who returned to the international fold this month after retiring last year, has yet to start a game this season. Bellamy conceded starting Allen against Montenegro would be a gamble. Josh Sheehan, of League One Bolton, could partner Allen\u2019s Swansea clubmate Oli Cooper in midfield. \u201cWe are light in the No 6 area, and that\u2019s through all the age groups,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cWe are a nation that sometimes has to be creative in what we do and sometimes that adds to your strengths. We\u2019ve seen bigger nations than ours really struggle in that area. It\u2019s a really important area for how we play. We just have to get on with it. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how one or two others get on.\u201d After all, these days the absences of important players \u2013 the in-form Brennan Johnson is also suspended \u2013 are not enough to dampen expectations. Ben Davies, who will captain Wales again with Ramsey missing, concedes they went \u201csky high\u201d after impressing against Turkey in Bellamy\u2019s first match. \u201cExpectations are made off the back of what we have done in the past,\u201d Davies says. \u201cThere was a time when Wales didn\u2019t qualify for any major tournaments and we were probably going into campaigns expecting to get nowhere near it. We want that expectation. We don\u2019t want a bit of luck to get to competitions. We want to push and play at the highest level. We\u2019ve had experiences at the World Cup and the Euros and we want more.\u201d The challenge for Wales, Bellamy acknowledged, is finding that often elusive consistency. Wales have shone in all three of his matches in charge but in each game bright first-half displays fizzled out in the second. Wales were 2-0 up in Iceland on Friday at the interval but were, ultimately, fortunate to leave Reykjavik with a point. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a number of meetings since then showing that discipline will allow you to have good habits,\u201d Bellamy says. \u201cGood habits allow you to be consistent. And if you\u2019re consistent, then you can grow. We\u2019re just in that period at the moment.\u201d",

Korir and Chepngetich ran in honor of the late Kelvin Kiptum of Kenya, who broke the men\u2019s world record at the 2023 Chicago Marathon. \u201cThe world record has come back to Kenya,\u201d Chepngetich said. \u201cI dedicate this world record to Kelvin Kiptum.\u201d In February the 24-year-old Kiptum and his coach, Gervais Hakizimana, died in a car accident. Police said Kiptum lost control of his vehicle before hitting a tree near a training area in Kaptagat, Kenya. Organizers held a moment of silence for Kiptum before the race and offered the nearly 50,000 runners a memorial sticker to add to their bibs.",

      "body": "<p>The Scottish politician Alex Salmond, who has died suddenly at the age of 69, was a commanding figure who came close to breaking up the United Kingdom in the 55.3 to 44.7% independence referendum of 2014.</p> <p>The decision by David Cameron to grant the powers to hold a referendum on Scottish independence marked the apex of Salmond\u2019s formidable career and reflected his achievement in leading the Scottish National party to power at Holyrood.</p> <p>Salmond\u2019s power base lay in north-east Scotland but, under his leadership, the SNP transformed its electoral fortunes in the Labour heartlands of the central belt.</p> <p>It was a paradox of his career that he was better suited to the cut and thrust of Westminster debate than the more constrained environment of Holyrood. He was an orator and debater who flourished on the bigger stage and became an influential player in the politics of the UK as a whole.</p> <p>After Salmond lost his Westminster seat in 2017, a nightmarish sequence of events dominated his life and placed enormous strains upon him. These centred around allegations from within the SNP and Scottish government of inappropriate sexual conduct in earlier years.</p> <p>Salmond was eventually cleared on all charges, but much of the damage to his reputation had been done. The provenance of these allegations remains bitterly contested, and at the time of his death Salmond was pursuing through the courts <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-67517416\">an action for damages against the Scottish government</a> and named individuals, including his successor, Nicola Sturgeon. Recently, the former Scottish minister and scion of an SNP dynasty, Fergus Ewing MSP, described the pursuit of Salmond as \u201cthe scandal of our age\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Linlithgow, West Lothian, Alex was the son of Mary (nee Milne) and Robert Salmond, <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituary-robert-salmond-civil-servant-and-war-veteran-who-raised-a-future-first-minister-1447199\">both civil servants</a>. The local MP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/26/tam-dalyell-obituary\">Tam Dalyell</a>, first encountered Salmond as a schoolboy at Linlithgow Academy who insisted on asking awkward questions about such subjects as prices and incomes policy. </p> <p>The SNP was on an upsurge, on the back of the \u201cScotland\u2019s Oil\u201d campaign, a cause that Salmond embraced in 1973, becoming a leading light in student debating at St Andrews University and president of the Federation of Student Nationalists. He graduated in 1978 with honours in economics.</p>    <p>His first job was as an agricultural economist in the former Scottish Office. However, he was quickly involved in political activism as the SNP hit the rocks in the 1979 general election, after voting with Margaret Thatcher to bring down the Labour government. Salmond joined with others on the left of the party to form <a href=\"https://www.holyrood.com/inside-politics/view,interview-the-79-group-snp-young-rebels-who-became-the-party-mainstream_9348.htm\">the 79 Group</a>, which demanded a radical agenda directed at working-class voters.</p> <p>This led to internal strife and Salmond \u2013 from 1980 employed by the Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 was briefly expelled in 1982 with other leading lights, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/04/margo-macdonald\">Margo Macdonald</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-stephen-maxwell-polotical-activist-69-1630264\">Stephen Maxwell</a>. However, the episode proved cathartic for the SNP and it emerged stronger.</p> <p>In 1985, Salmond became its vice-convener with responsibility for publicity. In Scotland, the general election of two years later was dominated by the poll tax, which the Tories had introduced in response to uproar from their own supporters over rating revaluation. Labour were the main beneficiaries, but three seats won by the SNP included Banff and Buchan, where Salmond defeated the incumbent Tory, Sir Albert McQuarrie. He also became deputy leader of the party.</p> <p>Salmond brought a cutting edge to the SNP\u2019s presence at Westminster. In 1988, he attracted national attention by getting himself suspended for a week from the House of Commons for interrupting Nigel Lawson\u2019s budget speech. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/12/salmond-scottish-nationalists-snp-margins-independence-vote\">election as leader of the SNP in 1990</a> created the platform for greater prominence and internal modernisation.</p> <p>While Labour was dominant in Scotland under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/12/guardianobituaries.labour\">Donald Dewar</a>\u2019s leadership, it was acutely aware that unless an offer was made on the constitution, this position was vulnerable. Dewar\u2019s response was to endorse a <a href=\"https://paulcairney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/scc-1995.pdf\">Scottish constitutional convention</a>, along with wide-ranging elements of political and civic Scotland, to plan a prospectus for devolution.</p> <p>Salmond\u2019s SNP stayed outside the convention because its scope did not include independence. However, with Labour returned in 1997 and a devolution referendum on the agenda, he skilfully adapted that position to support a \u201cyes\u201d vote. Labour, terrified that without SNP support the offer of a devolved parliament might be rejected, welcomed him into the tent.</p> <p>The belief that Holyrood in opposition did not greatly appeal to Salmond was reinforced when he resigned as SNP leader in 2000, but remained at Westminster. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-swinney\">John Swinney</a> succeeded him as leader and was not a success. When Swinney resigned in 2004, Salmond made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/sep/03/scotland.devolution\">last-minute decision to enter the contest</a> that Sturgeon was otherwise likely to have won. Instead, she settled for becoming Salmond\u2019s deputy.</p> <p>The electoral system for Holyrood was designed to prevent one-party domination and there had been a cosy expectation on the part of its founders that a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition would become the norm.</p> <p>However, as Labour\u2019s fortunes declined, this proved delusionary. In 2007, Salmond led the SNP to becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/04/scotland.devolution\">biggest party by a single seat</a>. By now a skilled deal-maker, he persuaded the Scottish Tories to provide him with the majority needed to form a government.</p> <p>In office, the SNP provided stable government with Salmond dominant. He was a man of ideas, an effective communicator and had built a good relationship with Scottish business. His trademark policy was universalism on issues such as free university tuition and benefits. While the middle classes were grateful beneficiaries, the principle also appealed to Scotland\u2019s leftish instincts.</p> <p>By 2011, with Labour still in disarray, Salmond achieved what the electoral system was not designed to deliver \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/06/snp-election-victory-scottish-independence\">single-party overall majority</a> at Holyrood with the SNP taking 69 of the 129 seats. It was the commanding nature of this result that persuaded Cameron he had no alternative to granting Salmond a referendum. Once again, Salmond proved a skilled negotiator in setting terms for the poll and framing of the question.</p> <p>The protracted campaign for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2014/sep/18/-sp-scottish-independence-referendum-results-in-full\">the 2014 referendum</a> saw a substantial increase in support for independence, and in its latter stages opinion polls suggested that the \u201cyes\u201d side was edging ahead. However, the weakness of its case lay in the economic argument, around issues such as currency and (ironically as it turned out) continuing EU membership. The first televised debate between Salmond and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/01/alistair-darling-lord-darling-obituary\">Alistair Darling</a> (who led the Better Together campaign) was particularly significant in this respect.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the referendum, Salmond announced his decision to resign both as first minister and leader of the SNP. It was a decision he would soon deeply regret. His protege and deputy, Sturgeon, succeeded him on the crest of a nationalist wave as the 45% that had voted for independence largely held together \u2013 enough to win elections but not a referendum.</p> <p>This was reflected in the 2015 general election, when Salmond returned to his old stomping ground of Westminster as MP for Gordon but found himself as one of 50 SNP MPs and in a relatively obscure role. In the 2017 election, he lost his seat to the biggest Tory swing in the UK. Reduced to the fringes of both Scottish and UK politics, he took on an ill-advised role as presenter of a weekly programme on the TV channel Russia Today.</p> <p>At the same time, his relationship with his successor was deteriorating rapidly. Salmond believed that his legacy was being squandered as the strategy for another independence referendum became increasingly unconvincing, to many inside as well as outside the SNP. However, Scotland was astounded by the turn in events of January 2019 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/24/alex-salmond-scotlands-former-first-minister-arrested\">police charged Salmond with 14 offences</a>, of which one was ultimately withdrawn.</p> <p>Salmond always maintained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/alex-salmond-acquitted-of-all-charges-in-sexual-assault-trial\">his innocence, and this was eventually sustained</a> in the high court in Edinburgh in March 2020 on all charges, but the bitterness created, and the questions surrounding the legal process pursued by the Scottish government, have never abated. In 2021, Salmond founded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/mar/26/alex-salmond-launches-new-independence-focused-political-party-alba\">Alba</a> as an alternative independence party to the SNP but it met with little success, depending heavily on his personal standing.</p> <p>Salmond was, by any standard, a major figure in Scottish and UK politics over several decades. He attracted strong loyalties and deep hostility. But to very many Scots, he was a clever and committed politician with exceptional skills who took his party from a low ebb to the exercise of power and close to its ultimate objective.</p> <p>He met Moira McGlashan when they were both Scottish Office civil servants, and they married in 1981. She survives him. </p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond, politician, born 31 December 1954; died 12 October 2024</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2024 because Alba was formed in 2021, not in 2022 as an earlier version said.</p>",

The decision by David Cameron to grant the powers to hold a referendum on Scottish independence marked the apex of Salmond\u2019s formidable career and reflected his achievement in leading the Scottish National party to power at Holyrood. Salmond\u2019s power base lay in north-east Scotland but, under his leadership, the SNP transformed its electoral fortunes in the Labour heartlands of the central belt.

The local MP, Tam Dalyell, first encountered Salmond as a schoolboy at Linlithgow Academy who insisted on asking awkward questions about such subjects as prices and incomes policy. The SNP was on an upsurge, on the back of the \u201cScotland\u2019s Oil\u201d campaign, a cause that Salmond embraced in 1973, becoming a leading light in student debating at St Andrews University and president of the Federation of Student Nationalists. He graduated in 1978 with honours in economics. His first job was as an agricultural economist in the former Scottish Office. However, he was quickly involved in political activism as the SNP hit the rocks in the 1979 general election, after voting with Margaret Thatcher to bring down the Labour government. Salmond joined with others on the left of the party to form the 79 Group, which demanded a radical agenda directed at working-class voters. This led to internal strife and Salmond \u2013 from 1980 employed by the Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 was briefly expelled in 1982 with other leading lights, including Margo Macdonald and Stephen Maxwell. However, the episode proved cathartic for the SNP and it emerged stronger. In 1985, Salmond became its vice-convener with responsibility for publicity. In Scotland, the general election of two years later was dominated by the poll tax, which the Tories had introduced in response to uproar from their own supporters over rating revaluation. Labour were the main beneficiaries, but three seats won by the SNP included Banff and Buchan, where Salmond defeated the incumbent Tory, Sir Albert McQuarrie. He also became deputy leader of the party. Salmond brought a cutting edge to the SNP\u2019s presence at Westminster. In 1988, he attracted national attention by getting himself suspended for a week from the House of Commons for interrupting Nigel Lawson\u2019s budget speech. His election as leader of the SNP in 1990 created the platform for greater prominence and internal modernisation. While Labour was dominant in Scotland under Donald Dewar\u2019s leadership, it was acutely aware that unless an offer was made on the constitution, this position was vulnerable. Dewar\u2019s response was to endorse a Scottish constitutional convention, along with wide-ranging elements of political and civic Scotland, to plan a prospectus for devolution. Salmond\u2019s SNP stayed outside the convention because its scope did not include independence. However, with Labour returned in 1997 and a devolution referendum on the agenda, he skilfully adapted that position to support a \u201cyes\u201d vote. Labour, terrified that without SNP support the offer of a devolved parliament might be rejected, welcomed him into the tent. The belief that Holyrood in opposition did not greatly appeal to Salmond was reinforced when he resigned as SNP leader in 2000, but remained at Westminster. John Swinney succeeded him as leader and was not a success. When Swinney resigned in 2004, Salmond made a last-minute decision to enter the contest that Sturgeon was otherwise likely to have won. Instead, she settled for becoming Salmond\u2019s deputy. The electoral system for Holyrood was designed to prevent one-party domination and there had been a cosy expectation on the part of its founders that a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition would become the norm. However, as Labour\u2019s fortunes declined, this proved delusionary. In 2007, Salmond led the SNP to becoming the biggest party by a single seat. By now a skilled deal-maker, he persuaded the Scottish Tories to provide him with the majority needed to form a government. In office, the SNP provided stable government with Salmond dominant. He was a man of ideas, an effective communicator and had built a good relationship with Scottish business. His trademark policy was universalism on issues such as free university tuition and benefits. While the middle classes were grateful beneficiaries, the principle also appealed to Scotland\u2019s leftish instincts. By 2011, with Labour still in disarray, Salmond achieved what the electoral system was not designed to deliver \u2013 a single-party overall majority at Holyrood with the SNP taking 69 of the 129 seats. It was the commanding nature of this result that persuaded Cameron he had no alternative to granting Salmond a referendum. Once again, Salmond proved a skilled negotiator in setting terms for the poll and framing of the question. The protracted campaign for the 2014 referendum saw a substantial increase in support for independence, and in its latter stages opinion polls suggested that the \u201cyes\u201d side was edging ahead. However, the weakness of its case lay in the economic argument, around issues such as currency and (ironically as it turned out) continuing EU membership. The first televised debate between Salmond and Alistair Darling (who led the Better Together campaign) was particularly significant in this respect. In the immediate aftermath of the referendum, Salmond announced his decision to resign both as first minister and leader of the SNP. It was a decision he would soon deeply regret. His protege and deputy, Sturgeon, succeeded him on the crest of a nationalist wave as the 45% that had voted for independence largely held together \u2013 enough to win elections but not a referendum. This was reflected in the 2015 general election, when Salmond returned to his old stomping ground of Westminster as MP for Gordon but found himself as one of 50 SNP MPs and in a relatively obscure role. In the 2017 election, he lost his seat to the biggest Tory swing in the UK. Reduced to the fringes of both Scottish and UK politics, he took on an ill-advised role as presenter of a weekly programme on the TV channel Russia Today. At the same time, his relationship with his successor was deteriorating rapidly. Salmond believed that his legacy was being squandered as the strategy for another independence referendum became increasingly unconvincing, to many inside as well as outside the SNP. However, Scotland was astounded by the turn in events of January 2019 when police charged Salmond with 14 offences, of which one was ultimately withdrawn. Salmond always maintained his innocence, and this was eventually sustained in the high court in Edinburgh in March 2020 on all charges, but the bitterness created, and the questions surrounding the legal process pursued by the Scottish government, have never abated. In 2021, Salmond founded Alba as an alternative independence party to the SNP but it met with little success, depending heavily on his personal standing. Salmond was, by any standard, a major figure in Scottish and UK politics over several decades. He attracted strong loyalties and deep hostility. But to very many Scots, he was a clever and committed politician with exceptional skills who took his party from a low ebb to the exercise of power and close to its ultimate objective. He met Moira McGlashan when they were both Scottish Office civil servants, and they married in 1981. She survives him. \u2022 Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond, politician, born 31 December 1954; died 12 October 2024 \u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2024 because Alba was formed in 2021, not in 2022 as an earlier version said.",

      "body": "<p>Alex Salmond cemented his place in British political history in May 2011 when he and the Scottish National party did something extraordinary.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/06/scottish-elections-salmond-historic-victory-snp\">They won an overall majority at Holyrood</a>, under a proportional system designed to promote coalitions, not one party\u2019s domination. With the SNP winning 69 of Holyrood\u2019s 129 seats, the result delivered two things that defined Salmond\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>It established the SNP as a formidable political force, forged largely by what John Swinney described on Sunday as Salmond\u2019s \u201cabsolute determination\u201d to win. And second, it established that a referendum on Scottish independence was inevitable.</p> <p>Yet questions later emerged about the side-effects of the power Salmond was allowed to accrue inside the party and the Scottish government.</p> <p>Did it prevent some of Salmond\u2019s colleagues from either seeing or acting on disturbing evidence about his personal conduct, actions that later led to his trial for sexual assaults, and the bitter feud with Nicola Sturgeon that defined his later years?</p> <p>Within months of the 2011 election, the then Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government led by David Cameron quickly agreed to Salmond\u2019s demands for a referendum. At the time support for independence hovered at about 32%; Cameron and his close allies were confident of victory and on 19 September 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/scotland-independence-no-vote-victory-alex-salmond\">the no campaign won</a> by 55% to 45%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/13/alex-salmond-death-scotland-alba-leader\">Alex Salmond\u2019s political star had long faded. Yet his death has sent shock waves through Scotland | Lesley Riddoch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Salmond quit, paving the way for Sturgeon to be anointed SNP leader unopposed. But in that defeat Salmond had succeeded in normalising independence as a popular position, thanks to the depth and quality of his partnership with Sturgeon. She drew in younger, leftwing urban voters, complementing his appeal to rural, suburban middle Scotland.</p> <p>Support for independence has hovered since then at about 45% to 50%. The yes vote is now the settled will of a majority of younger voters. </p> <p>It also set the SNP up to become one of the most dominant political forces in recent British political history. Until July this year, the SNP had not lost an election in Scotland since its first narrow victory in 2007.</p> <p>Buoyed by the remarkable surge in SNP support that sprung out of the referendum defeat, when the party\u2019s membership soared to 120,000, the SNP won an extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/snp-surge-claims-first-major-labour-scalp-with-douglas-alexanders-defeat\">landslide election in 2015</a>, taking 56 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Westminster seats on 50% of the vote.</p> <p>Yet that proved, in retrospect, to be Sturgeon\u2019s high point. The EU referendum in 2016, when Scotland voted to remain yet was expected to acquiesce to Brexit because of England\u2019s vote to leave, briefly turbocharged support for independence.</p> <p>Her attempts to leverage a second independence referendum from Brexit backfired in the 2017 general election. Voters were alienated by her rhetoric, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/snp-deputy-angus-robertson-ousted-by-tories-on-bad-night-for-sturgeons-party\">SNP lost a host of seats</a> \u2013 including Salmond\u2019s. He had never lost a parliamentary contest before, and he lashed out.</p> <p>To Sturgeon\u2019s frustration, Salmond ignored advice from his closest aides to choose a dignified exit by setting up a foundation or taking his pick of international roles. Instead he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/17/be-ashamed-alex-salmond-courts-controversy-rt-russia-today\">launched a chat show</a> on the Kremlin-funded television channel RT.</p>    <p>In August 2018, the news broke that Salmond had been investigated by Scottish government officials for alleged misconduct towards female civil servants. Although the findings were later set aside by a court for procedural failings, including apparent bias, that internal inquiry had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/aug/30/alex-salmond-inquiry-upheld-five-sexual-harassment-complaints\">upheld five complaints</a> from two women.</p> <p>In March 2020, Salmond was prosecuted on 13 charges of sexual assault, including sexual assault with intent to rape. He was acquitted of every charge yet the trial heard some complaints were dealt with quietly by some of Salmond\u2019s officials; some complainers admitted they downplayed their experiences at the time to avoid undermining Salmond\u2019s independence campaign.</p> <p>Even his lawyer described Salmond\u2019s \u201ctouchy-feely\u201d behaviour as \u201cinappropriate\u201d. One confidante suggests he remained unwilling to reflect on his own part in this, and still believed strongly the charges were the result of a conspiracy.</p> <p>By then Holyrood had launched its investigation into the government\u2019s mishandling of the internal review, entrenching a now open feud with Sturgeon.</p> <p>In spring 2021, Salmond\u2019s popularity had plummeted: open polls showed as few as 8% of voters were favourable towards him; as many as 75% disliked him. Sturgeon\u2019s popularity had soared, particularly during the first year of the Covid crisis.</p> <p>Salmond had quit the SNP in fury, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/mar/26/alex-salmond-launches-new-independence-focused-political-party-alba\">setting up a rival party, Alba</a>. It became an outlet for a handful of SNP politicians and those activists irritated by Sturgeon\u2019s progressive, identity-focused policies, and her alliance with the Scottish Greens.</p> <p>With Salmond\u2019s unexpected death, Alba is unlikely to survive as a political force. Its sole MSP, Ash Regan, is unlikely to win a seat at the next Holyrood election; in the July general election Alba won just 0.5% of the national vote.</p> <p>Salmond\u2019s death also raises a more subtle and significant question for the wider nationalist movement. With Sturgeon now a largely inactive backbencher who may not stand again for Holyrood, Swinney is the only established nationalist leader left.</p> <p>There are a handful of possible candidates in the younger generation \u2013 Swinney\u2019s deputy, Kate Forbes, and the party\u2019s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, are mentioned most often, but until the next Holyrood election in 2026, Swinney will be the last veteran standing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alex Salmond cemented his place in British political history in May 2011 when he and the Scottish National party did something extraordinary. They won an overall majority at Holyrood, under a proportional system designed to promote coalitions, not one party\u2019s domination. With the SNP winning 69 of Holyrood\u2019s 129 seats, the result delivered two things that defined Salmond\u2019s legacy. It established the SNP as a formidable political force, forged largely by what John Swinney described on Sunday as Salmond\u2019s \u201cabsolute determination\u201d to win. And second, it established that a referendum on Scottish independence was inevitable. Yet questions later emerged about the side-effects of the power Salmond was allowed to accrue inside the party and the Scottish government. Did it prevent some of Salmond\u2019s colleagues from either seeing or acting on disturbing evidence about his personal conduct, actions that later led to his trial for sexual assaults, and the bitter feud with Nicola Sturgeon that defined his later years? Within months of the 2011 election, the then Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government led by David Cameron quickly agreed to Salmond\u2019s demands for a referendum. At the time support for independence hovered at about 32%; Cameron and his close allies were confident of victory and on 19 September 2014, the no campaign won by 55% to 45%. Salmond quit, paving the way for Sturgeon to be anointed SNP leader unopposed. But in that defeat Salmond had succeeded in normalising independence as a popular position, thanks to the depth and quality of his partnership with Sturgeon. She drew in younger, leftwing urban voters, complementing his appeal to rural, suburban middle Scotland. Support for independence has hovered since then at about 45% to 50%. The yes vote is now the settled will of a majority of younger voters. It also set the SNP up to become one of the most dominant political forces in recent British political history. Until July this year, the SNP had not lost an election in Scotland since its first narrow victory in 2007. Buoyed by the remarkable surge in SNP support that sprung out of the referendum defeat, when the party\u2019s membership soared to 120,000, the SNP won an extraordinary landslide election in 2015, taking 56 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Westminster seats on 50% of the vote. Yet that proved, in retrospect, to be Sturgeon\u2019s high point. The EU referendum in 2016, when Scotland voted to remain yet was expected to acquiesce to Brexit because of England\u2019s vote to leave, briefly turbocharged support for independence. Her attempts to leverage a second independence referendum from Brexit backfired in the 2017 general election. Voters were alienated by her rhetoric, and the SNP lost a host of seats \u2013 including Salmond\u2019s. He had never lost a parliamentary contest before, and he lashed out. To Sturgeon\u2019s frustration, Salmond ignored advice from his closest aides to choose a dignified exit by setting up a foundation or taking his pick of international roles. Instead he launched a chat show on the Kremlin-funded television channel RT. In August 2018, the news broke that Salmond had been investigated by Scottish government officials for alleged misconduct towards female civil servants. Although the findings were later set aside by a court for procedural failings, including apparent bias, that internal inquiry had upheld five complaints from two women. In March 2020, Salmond was prosecuted on 13 charges of sexual assault, including sexual assault with intent to rape. He was acquitted of every charge yet the trial heard some complaints were dealt with quietly by some of Salmond\u2019s officials; some complainers admitted they downplayed their experiences at the time to avoid undermining Salmond\u2019s independence campaign. Even his lawyer described Salmond\u2019s \u201ctouchy-feely\u201d behaviour as \u201cinappropriate\u201d. One confidante suggests he remained unwilling to reflect on his own part in this, and still believed strongly the charges were the result of a conspiracy. By then Holyrood had launched its investigation into the government\u2019s mishandling of the internal review, entrenching a now open feud with Sturgeon. In spring 2021, Salmond\u2019s popularity had plummeted: open polls showed as few as 8% of voters were favourable towards him; as many as 75% disliked him. Sturgeon\u2019s popularity had soared, particularly during the first year of the Covid crisis. Salmond had quit the SNP in fury, setting up a rival party, Alba. It became an outlet for a handful of SNP politicians and those activists irritated by Sturgeon\u2019s progressive, identity-focused policies, and her alliance with the Scottish Greens. With Salmond\u2019s unexpected death, Alba is unlikely to survive as a political force. Its sole MSP, Ash Regan, is unlikely to win a seat at the next Holyrood election; in the July general election Alba won just 0.5% of the national vote. Salmond\u2019s death also raises a more subtle and significant question for the wider nationalist movement. With Sturgeon now a largely inactive backbencher who may not stand again for Holyrood, Swinney is the only established nationalist leader left. There are a handful of possible candidates in the younger generation \u2013 Swinney\u2019s deputy, Kate Forbes, and the party\u2019s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, are mentioned most often, but until the next Holyrood election in 2026, Swinney will be the last veteran standing.",

A daddy\u2019s girl, even after Elvis\u2019s divorce from her mother, Priscilla, she would ride around the grounds in her own golf cart and threaten to get staff sacked.</p> <p>Elvis looms large in these passages: taking his daughter on a rollercoaster with a gun in a holster; shooting snakes in the grounds. He was a long-term prescription drug addict and Lisa Marie would sometimes find him passed out on the floor.

In subsequent years, she responded with the standard teenage cocktail of cynicism and rebellion: any drugs, bar heroin (\u201canything I could swallow, snort, eat, sniff\u201d); terrible boyfriends, one of whom orchestrated a paparazzi set-up. She had howling insecurities as the daughter of the \u201cking\u201d. When Presley eventually made music, she resisted pressure to sound like her father.</p>    <p>Nor did she feel close to her mother. Elvis met Priscilla when she was 14 (\u201cit was a different time\u201d, writes Lisa Marie, brusquely noting they didn\u2019t have sex until her mother was 18). Priscilla springs from these pages like some southern belle ice queen. After Elvis\u2019s death: \u201cIt was a one-two punch: he\u2019s dead and I\u2019m stuck with her.\u201d When they both became Scientologists, Lisa Marie felt Priscilla was \u201cdumping\u201d her there. Later there was a truce, but you don\u2019t sense a real reconciliation: \u201cPeople think I\u2019m a bitch because unfortunately I have my mom\u2019s chilly thing.\u201d</p> <p>Her healthiest relationship was with Riley and Ben\u2019s father (Danny Keough), and they remained lifelong friends. While the Cage union is dealt with relatively swiftly and politely, the mid-90s marriage to Jackson gets the full candid treatment. She brushes aside the child molestation accusations (\u201cI never saw a goddamn thing like that. I personally would\u2019ve killed him if I had\u201d). He told her he was a virgin (\u201cHe said Madonna had tried to hook up with him once, too, but nothing happened\u201d) and was interested in her sexually (\u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m not waiting!\u2019\u201d). Later, Presley would start to doubt Jackson, who also had drug problems and his own&nbsp;anaesthetist. She also suspected he would dump her if she had his much-wanted children: \u201cHe was very controlling and calculating.\u201d</p> <p>There is lots more going on too, as she succumbs to opioids, drifting in and out of rehab. But it\u2019s the passages about her son\u2019s body that make you wonder if you\u2019re hallucinating (\u201cI think it would scare the living fucking piss out of anybody else to have their son there like that. But not me\u201d) \u2013 especially when she shows a tattooist the tattoo she wants by displaying it on Ben\u2019s dead hand.</p> <p>Reading this, an uneasy thought occurs. Presley may have been happy to do the tapes, but would she have wanted it <em>all</em> published? We\u2019ll never know. Certainly, it\u2019s clear that Presley was nothing if not radically honest. It\u2019s also striking how Keough seems to almost plead with the reader to understand and love her mother as much as she does. Ultimately, this is a book built on grief: Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s for her father and son, but also a daughter\u2019s for her mother.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>From Here to the Great Unknown</em> by Lisa Marie Presley and Riley Keough is published by Pan Macmillan (\u00a325).

After Elvis\u2019s death: \u201cIt was a one-two punch: he\u2019s dead and I\u2019m stuck with her.\u201d When they both became Scientologists, Lisa Marie felt Priscilla was \u201cdumping\u201d her there. Later there was a truce, but you don\u2019t sense a real reconciliation: \u201cPeople think I\u2019m a bitch because unfortunately I have my mom\u2019s chilly thing.\u201d Her healthiest relationship was with Riley and Ben\u2019s father (Danny Keough), and they remained lifelong friends. While the Cage union is dealt with relatively swiftly and politely, the mid-90s marriage to Jackson gets the full candid treatment. She brushes aside the child molestation accusations (\u201cI never saw a goddamn thing like that. I personally would\u2019ve killed him if I had\u201d). He told her he was a virgin (\u201cHe said Madonna had tried to hook up with him once, too, but nothing happened\u201d) and was interested in her sexually (\u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m not waiting!\u2019\u201d). Later, Presley would start to doubt Jackson, who also had drug problems and his own anaesthetist. She also suspected he would dump her if she had his much-wanted children: \u201cHe was very controlling and calculating.\u201d There is lots more going on too, as she succumbs to opioids, drifting in and out of rehab. But it\u2019s the passages about her son\u2019s body that make you wonder if you\u2019re hallucinating (\u201cI think it would scare the living fucking piss out of anybody else to have their son there like that. But not me\u201d) \u2013 especially when she shows a tattooist the tattoo she wants by displaying it on Ben\u2019s dead hand. Reading this, an uneasy thought occurs. Presley may have been happy to do the tapes, but would she have wanted it all published? We\u2019ll never know. Certainly, it\u2019s clear that Presley was nothing if not radically honest. It\u2019s also striking how Keough seems to almost plead with the reader to understand and love her mother as much as she does. Ultimately, this is a book built on grief: Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s for her father and son, but also a daughter\u2019s for her mother. \u2022 From Here to the Great Unknown by Lisa Marie Presley and Riley Keough is published by Pan Macmillan (\u00a325).

However, it said: \u201cChallice has no interest in either selling its Mulberry shares to Frasers or providing Frasers with any irrevocable or other undertaking with regards the possible offer.\u201d It pointed out that Frasers would be unable to take over Mulberry without its support, and said: \u201cChallice hopes that by making its position clear, Frasers will be encouraged to announce that it does not intend to make an offer for Mulberry.\u201d It said it was \u201cvery supportive of the company and its current management team\u201d and believed in the long-term value of the Mulberry brand. \u201cChallice believes that it is an inopportune time for Mulberry to be sold and particularly regrets the distraction that the possible offer is bringing to the company and its management team at this time.\u201d Mulberry \u2013 founded in 1971 by the entrepreneur Roger Saul and his mother, Joan, is best known for its leather goods, particularly women\u2019s handbags. In recent times it has struggled to compete against bigger international brands, especially since the post-Brexit ending of shopping tax breaks for tourists to the UK. Thierry Andretta, who led Mulberry from 2015, oversaw a push to take it upmarket, but the arrival of Baldo, who previously ran the fashion label Ganni and was involved in a turnaround at the Italian streetwear brand Diesel, is expected to herald a shift back to a broader appeal.",

      "body": "<p>The odds of Britain securing the America\u2019s Cup for the first time lengthened a little further on Sunday after the dominant New Zealand team \u00adestablished a three\u2011race lead in the first-to-seven, 13-race competition.</p> \n<p>The planned fourth race was cancelled as winds failed to reach the minimum 6.5 knots and will be held as a one-off on Monday. Weather permitting, the two-race schedule will resume on Wednesday. Britain\u2019s Ineos team may feel relieved that Sunday\u2019s second race was cancelled after a New Zealand display of superiority over the first three races that the \u00adSpanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo described as \u201calmost insulting\u201d.</p> \n<p>On the second day of the showdown, race&nbsp;three proved to be pretty much a replica of the first two contests. On a fine, warm day with a light north-easterly wind of 7-10 knots, once again the Emirates Team New \u00adZealand boat made an aggressive and better start and quickly \u00adestablished a comfortable lead. The two boats almost collided at the start line, for which the British team paid with a 75-metre penalty for failing to keep&nbsp;clear.</p> \n<p>By the end of the first stage, New Zealand were 150m ahead, extending their lead to 400m by the fourth leg before crossing the line with more than 600m of clear water, 52 seconds ahead of Ineos Britannia, having led at every stage. At each turn they seemed to have better acceleration than their rivals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fc127adf-8612-4858-bffe-02fc00d68dc7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p> Sir Ben Ainslie took a swipe at a TV commentator after Britain fell 3-0 behind. In the live on-boat post-race TV interviews, Ainslie was asked by the New Zealand commentator Stephen McIvor if he still believed the British boat was as close to New Zealand when it comes to performance. Visibly annoyed by the question, Ainslie replied: \"Maybe that's the Kiwi commentator in you, mate.\" As the cameras cut away, with the live feed still being broadcast, the British skipper could be heard to swear \"fucking wanker\" into his microphone. When pressed on the incident later in the team's press conference, Ainslie said: \"It was a stupid comment from the Kiwi commentator. I think it's good for our team. I think it's good motivation.\" <b>PA Media</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked about the manoeuvre at the start line Peter Burling, the New \u00adZealand captain, said the team had been \u201cworking on little bits and pieces\u201d, adding: \u201cWe tried it yesterday and they just got past us. It was uncomfortable how close the boats got but it was great to finally execute it in a race, to make it count.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ray Davies, the New Zealand coach, said: \u201cIt was an awesome moment that we\u2019ve been practising a lot. It was great to see a bit of match racing creeping in. Ben [Ainslie, the British captain] has been asking for someone to do it for quite a long time. It was good that it was us who gave him one of those.\u201d </p> \n<p>Ainslie believed his team\u2019s \u00adpenalty at the start was a tough call. \u201cIt felt like we were keeping clear but the umpires didn\u2019t see it that way,\u201d he said, adding that he accepted the&nbsp;decision.</p> \n<p>The general view is that, technically, there is little to choose between the British and New Zealand boats and that it is the drivers that count. On this showing, New&nbsp;Zealand\u2019s are simply better than&nbsp;Britain\u2019s.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re under no illusions,\u201d Burling said. \u201cThey\u2019re an amazing team and they\u2019re going to be putting together a hell of a fight, so we\u2019re expecting a battle every race, but we\u2019re definitely up for it.\u201d</p> \n<p>People in Barcelona have been largely indifferent to a competition in which racing started two months ago, and the boats have been \u00advisible in the port since the start of the year. However, there have been signs that America\u2019s Cup fever is finally \u00adbeginning to catch on. The fan zones were packed on Sunday, with British fans heavily outnumbered by New \u00adZealand supporters, many wearing the ETNZ team shirt. In addition \u00addozens of boats, large and small, crowded around the edges of the race area to give fans a closer look.</p> \n<p>By no means is everyone in Barcelona happy about the competition being staged here, though, and opposition has been building over recent months. Two hours before racing began on Sunday thousands of people \u2013 10,000 according to the organisers \u2013 joined a protest organised by the \u201cNo to the America\u2019s Cup\u201d campaign, which is supported by about 140 local and community organisations.</p> \n<p>Protesters say that holding these prestigious events benefits only the wealthy and contributes to \u00adrising housing costs, pricing residents out of their homes. The campaign is also&nbsp;bringing a case to the anti-fraud office on the grounds that the \u00adorganisers allegedly made false and grossly inflated claims about the \u00adeconomic benefits to the city of \u00adhosting the event.</p> \n<p>Technically speaking, the racing could continue for another week, but the British team know that they will have to up their game if they do not want to find themselves heading home on Friday on the losing end of a 7-0 scoreline.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know there\u2019s a long way to go in this competition, we just keep pushing hard,\u201d said Ainslie, whose phlegmatic nature has been put to the test these past 48 hours.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The odds of Britain securing the America\u2019s Cup for the first time lengthened a little further on Sunday after the dominant New Zealand team established a three\u2011race lead in the first-to-seven, 13-race competition. The planned fourth race was cancelled as winds failed to reach the minimum 6.5 knots and will be held as a one-off on Monday. Weather permitting, the two-race schedule will resume on Wednesday. Britain\u2019s Ineos team may feel relieved that Sunday\u2019s second race was cancelled after a New Zealand display of superiority over the first three races that the Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo described as \u201calmost insulting\u201d. On the second day of the showdown, race three proved to be pretty much a replica of the first two contests. On a fine, warm day with a light north-easterly wind of 7-10 knots, once again the Emirates Team New Zealand boat made an aggressive and better start and quickly established a comfortable lead. The two boats almost collided at the start line, for which the British team paid with a 75-metre penalty for failing to keep clear. By the end of the first stage, New Zealand were 150m ahead, extending their lead to 400m by the fourth leg before crossing the line with more than 600m of clear water, 52 seconds ahead of Ineos Britannia, having led at every stage. At each turn they seemed to have better acceleration than their rivals. Asked about the manoeuvre at the start line Peter Burling, the New Zealand captain, said the team had been \u201cworking on little bits and pieces\u201d, adding: \u201cWe tried it yesterday and they just got past us. It was uncomfortable how close the boats got but it was great to finally execute it in a race, to make it count.\u201d Ray Davies, the New Zealand coach, said: \u201cIt was an awesome moment that we\u2019ve been practising a lot. It was great to see a bit of match racing creeping in. Ben [Ainslie, the British captain] has been asking for someone to do it for quite a long time. It was good that it was us who gave him one of those.\u201d Ainslie believed his team\u2019s penalty at the start was a tough call. \u201cIt felt like we were keeping clear but the umpires didn\u2019t see it that way,\u201d he said, adding that he accepted the decision. The general view is that, technically, there is little to choose between the British and New Zealand boats and that it is the drivers that count. On this showing, New Zealand\u2019s are simply better than Britain\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusions,\u201d Burling said. \u201cThey\u2019re an amazing team and they\u2019re going to be putting together a hell of a fight, so we\u2019re expecting a battle every race, but we\u2019re definitely up for it.\u201d People in Barcelona have been largely indifferent to a competition in which racing started two months ago, and the boats have been visible in the port since the start of the year. However, there have been signs that America\u2019s Cup fever is finally beginning to catch on. The fan zones were packed on Sunday, with British fans heavily outnumbered by New Zealand supporters, many wearing the ETNZ team shirt. In addition dozens of boats, large and small, crowded around the edges of the race area to give fans a closer look. By no means is everyone in Barcelona happy about the competition being staged here, though, and opposition has been building over recent months. Two hours before racing began on Sunday thousands of people \u2013 10,000 according to the organisers \u2013 joined a protest organised by the \u201cNo to the America\u2019s Cup\u201d campaign, which is supported by about 140 local and community organisations. Protesters say that holding these prestigious events benefits only the wealthy and contributes to rising housing costs, pricing residents out of their homes. The campaign is also bringing a case to the anti-fraud office on the grounds that the organisers allegedly made false and grossly inflated claims about the economic benefits to the city of hosting the event. Technically speaking, the racing could continue for another week, but the British team know that they will have to up their game if they do not want to find themselves heading home on Friday on the losing end of a 7-0 scoreline. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a long way to go in this competition, we just keep pushing hard,\u201d said Ainslie, whose phlegmatic nature has been put to the test these past 48 hours.",

I think if they go for employers\u2019 national insurance, firstly, it\u2019s a very bad tax to raise, because it\u2019s a tax on jobs, and what they should be about is growth and increasing productivity in the economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/13/how-labour-promises-have-left-rachel-reeves-with-a-giant-budget-headache\">How Labour promises have left Rachel Reeves with a giant budget headache</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe second thing is, I think it goes totally counter to their manifesto that assured us they would not be putting up national insurance.\u201d</p> <p>Stride also said the government\u2019s claim that the Conservatives left a \u00a322bn hole in public finances was \u201cfictitious\u201d.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said the Labour government inherited a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d from its predecessors, causing speculation about how she will raise funds.</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimated this week that \u00a325bn would need to be raised in tax increases if Reeves wanted to keep spending rising with national income.</p> <p>The chancellor has also hinted she is planning to tweak the rules that dictate how much the government is allowed to borrow for spending on infrastructure investment.

Speaking on Sky\u2019s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, Jonathan Reynolds was asked if the pledge applied to employees\u2019 and employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs). He replied: \u201cThat pledge, it was taxes on working people, so it was specifically in the manifesto, a reference to employees and to income tax.\u201d He said he would not say anything more before the budget, but his comments have fuelled speculation that a rise in employer contributions is being considered. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot already in the manifesto, but you have to wait for the detail of a budget,\u201d he said. NICs are paid by employees and employers and it has been unclear whether Labour\u2019s promise not to increase the tax included both. During prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Keir Starmer declined to rule out raising employers\u2019 NICs in the budget. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, said it would be an \u201cabsurdity\u201d for Labour to argue that raising employers\u2019 NICs was not a breach of its manifesto commitments. Stride said Labour had \u201cboxed themselves in\u201d by claiming it was not going to have to put up taxes, \u201cand therefore saying that they would not put up all sorts of different taxes, broadly based taxes that account for about 75% of all the taxes raised\u201d. He said: \u201cThat leaves you with a narrow field of taxes now to go for. I think if they go for employers\u2019 national insurance, firstly, it\u2019s a very bad tax to raise, because it\u2019s a tax on jobs, and what they should be about is growth and increasing productivity in the economy. \u201cThe second thing is, I think it goes totally counter to their manifesto that assured us they would not be putting up national insurance.\u201d Stride also said the government\u2019s claim that the Conservatives left a \u00a322bn hole in public finances was \u201cfictitious\u201d. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said the Labour government inherited a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d from its predecessors, causing speculation about how she will raise funds. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimated this week that \u00a325bn would need to be raised in tax increases if Reeves wanted to keep spending rising with national income. The chancellor has also hinted she is planning to tweak the rules that dictate how much the government is allowed to borrow for spending on infrastructure investment. Writing in the Sunday Times, Reeves said it was \u201ctime that the Treasury moved on from just counting the costs of investments, to recognising the benefits too\u201d. Charlie Nunn, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, told the BBC on Sunday that he was concerned about the impact of taxing employers\u2019 pension contributions. He said: \u201cAnything that helps people continue to invest and take appropriate risk, we think, is really important. Anything that does the opposite would be a handbrake. \u201cPensions, and contributions to pensions, are critical. We see about 40% of people in the UK have a pension which won\u2019t give them even a basic living allowance when they retire. So we need to increase enrolment and investments in pensions.\u201d",

But if she gets a little too forceful, slamming down on a beat, a safety mechanism kicks in to prevent her from doing any damage to herself or the musicians. Rindt told MDR he had the idea of stepping aside for a sophisticated robot 23 years ago while rehearsing an intricate composition. One of the bassoonists told the conductor: \u201cYou\u2019re conducting the clarinets in 3/4 time and I have 5/8, a totally different tempo \u2013 what should I do, no one is conducting me?\u201d And the conductor answered: \u201cI\u2019m not a robot.\u201d Local media reported an enthusiastic reception for the world premiere on Saturday night, which is to be followed by a livestreamed concert on Sunday. MAiRA is perhaps the most technically advanced robot to conduct music but she is not the first. In 2008, a 1.2-metre-tall automaton with a baton conducted the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Mitch Leigh\u2019s The Impossible Dream from the Man from La Mancha. Nine years later, the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and the Lucca Philharmonic Orchestra performed in Pisa with YuMi, billed as a \u201ccollaborative\u201d dual-arm robot conductor. And in South Korea in July 2023, an android robot took the conductor\u2019s podium at Seoul\u2019s National Theater of Korea. During its quarter-century of existence, Dresden\u2019s Sinfoniker has often pushed the envelope of contemporary music. In 2006, it played an arrangement of the soundtrack of the classic silent film Battleship Potemkin from the balconies of a communist-era housing development in central Dresden, while the British pop duo Pet Shop Boys played on the roof. And in 2017, it staged a festival \u201cagainst isolation and intolerance\u201d during the Trump presidency close to the US-Mexican border wall near Tijuana and performed with Mexican and US musicians.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email They did not allow the greyhound to be medically examined before the procedure but the vet told the tribunal it \u201cdid not appear injured and there was no obvious fracture\u201d and it was standing \u201cOK on all four legs\u201d. The tribunal determined the trainer made \u201cno effort at all\u201d to rehome the greyhound and deemed the euthanasia \u201cunnecessary\u201d. Penalty findings for the case are ongoing and have been requested in written form due to the trainer\u2019s \u201caggressive outbursts\u201d during the hearing. In another case from 2022, a different trainer was found by the tribunal to have euthanised nine dogs between 2016 and 2019 without any effort to rehome them and without notifying the body that oversees the industry, Greyhound Racing Victoria. Instead, the trainer misled the GRV by reporting the dogs as \u201cretired pets\u201d. \u201cEach dog was euthanised \u2026 and it was always your intention that this would happen,\u201d the tribunal\u2019s finding reads. In New South Wales similar concerns have emerged, with a report by the greyhound racing peak body\u2019s former chief vet Dr Alex Brittan alleging some vets in the industry willingly euthanise large numbers of greyhounds. The report, which has led to an independent inquiry, named two vets \u201cresponsible for half the euthanasia in NSW\u201d. The Victorian state Animal Justice party MP Georgie Purcell said there was no way to know how many healthy greyhounds were being euthanised in Victoria because GRV does not publish a breakdown of deaths. Its annual report has previously only included an overall figure for euthanasia as well as \u201cracing fatalities\u201d \u2013 deaths that occur instantaneously on the track. In the 2022-23 reporting period, GRV recorded 382 euthanasia deaths and 40 racing fatalities. \u201cIt\u2019s really misleading to the public because euthanasia sounds like it was in the best interest of the dog,\u201d Purcell said. \u201cBut we know there are dogs with treatable injuries that industry participants just want dead because they might not be economically viable any more.\u201d In parliament on Wednesday Purcell will move a motion that, if passed, would force GRV to report how many dogs are killed off-track and the specific reasons for that. The motion also proposes that any deaths occurring within 10 days of a race, training or trial be reclassified as racing fatalities. In response, GRV said its latest figures showed racing fatalities in Victoria had decreased by 47% over the past five years. \u201cInstances of euthanasia have also declined by nearly 40% \u2026 as a result of GRV\u2019s dedication to ensuring all healthy retired greyhounds are rehomed as pets once their racing careers are over,\u201d it said. Guardian Australia understands that GRV\u2019s upcoming annual report, yet to be tabled in parliament, will include a breakdown of \u201ceuthanasia by reason\u201d and non-euthanasia deaths. While there are no plans to reclassify racing fatalities, Guardian Australia understands GRV is open to introducing a separate category: \u201ctrack-related mortality not as part of race meeting\u201d, which is a classification used in NSW.",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s supporters do not pitch up at his rallies expecting to hear policy speeches or even the truth. Mostly they go for the comfort of distractions from hard realities and the allure of false promises to revive the past.</p> \n<p>But some of the loudest cheers at Trump\u2019s recent rally in Saginaw, Michigan, came in response to a claim the former US president\u2019s supporters could believe, when he said election polls were swinging his way in the battleground state and that Kamala Harris\u2019s \u201choneymoon period\u201d was over.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re up in all of the polls. We\u2019re up in every swing state. They had a honeymoon period,\u201d he said before he was drowned out by the cheering crowd.</p> \n<p>With just three weeks left until the election, Democrats fear that Trump is right. Some complain that Harris has squandered an initial burst of enthusiasm after Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, which sparked a surge in fundraising and volunteering for her campaign.</p> \n<p>Michigan is one of the handful of key swing states that will decide the result of this most momentous of elections. While Harris has a slight lead in national polls, she is <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/michigan/\">struggling in Michigan</a>, a state she must win or face a more challenging path through the US\u2019s electoral college to take the White House. Trump won the state by just 10,704 in 2016 and lost it by a narrow margin to Biden four years later.</p> \n<p>The stakes are enormous. Trump has campaigned in 2024 on an ever more extreme platform, threatening mass deportations of immigrants and promising to seek revenge on his political enemies if he returns to the White House. Last week, Trump even demanded one of America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/trump-cbs-license-harris-interview\">big television networks lose its licence</a> because he sees its political coverage as unfair to him. In a country that prides itself on free speech, freedom of the press could ail quickly under a second Trump term. For many, US democracy itself feels on the line.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/saginaw-zip/giv-4559UAVTVXolxCgB/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/saginaw-zip/giv-4559UAVTVXolxCgB/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The Harris campaign has long considered its easiest path to victory is by winning the Rust belt battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If the vice-president were to lose in Michigan, she would almost certainly need to win one of the other closely contested states of Georgia, Arizona or North Carolina.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3913\">Quinnipiac University poll </a>released last Wednesday put the vice-president three points behind Trump in Michigan, while <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/michigan/trump-vs-harris\">poll trackers</a> offer a mixed picture.</p> \n<p>For those desperate to know which way Michigan might go, it is Saginaw that is the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/21/saginaw-michigan-swing-state-trump-harris-election\"> bellwether county of the state</a>. Barack Obama won it twice before Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the county by a little more than 1,000 votes, just over 1% of the ballot, in 2016. Four years later, Biden took Saginaw county from Trump by an even narrower margin of just 303 votes.</p> \n<p>Both campaigns are piling resources into Michigan including a deluge of frantic television advertising, and a merry-go-round of candidates and prominent supporters wheeling through the state.</p> \n<p>Harris\u2019s running mate, Tim Walz, was in Detroit on Friday looking to win over blue-collar union voters. The vice-president is expected in Detroit <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/11/kamala-harris-detroit-michigan-visit-charlamagne-that-god-radio/75625818007/\">on Tuesday</a> in a bid to turn out Black voters who are key to a Democratic victory in Michigan.</p> \n<p>The Harris campaign has wheeled out Barack Obama in recent days and sent Bernie Sanders, the darling of the left of the Democratic party, to rally student support in Saginaw a week ago.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, traversed Michigan promising to bring back the old and attacking the new. Vance joked to an audience in Detroit on Tuesday about the importance of the state: \u201cI\u2019m going to be in Michigan like 30 times\u201d before the election.</p> \n<p>The pair have repeatedly pledged to make the American car industry great again, after so many jobs were lost to globalisation and automation, while attacking its future by scorning electric vehicles. Trump\u2019s rally in Saginaw leaned heavily on promises to bring back the dozen or so auto factories in the county that have closed in recent years.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bf30d5e8-4209-4d30-91e8-82f6a9e72604\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In what is expected to be a knife-edge US election decided by a few voters in a handful of key battleground states, the Guardian is exploring Saginaw, Michigan. It is a swing area in a swing state whose voters will bear an outsize influence on the outcome of the fight between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Chris McGreal is on the ground in Saginaw in the run up to November's election examining the issues that voters of all political backgrounds care about.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/26/saginaw-michigan-voters-presidential-election-trump-harris-share\"><b>Saginaw voters: tell us which issues will decide the US election</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Alongside the fantasy promises is a darker campaign aimed at those who do not fit the view of what many Trump supporters think an American should look like. Some of it is dressed up as opposition to illegal immigration but groups supporting Trump are running television ads with sinister overtones in Michigan, including one paid for by Duty to America that shows a series of photographs of white people who are said to have been \u201cleft behind\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if we do everything right, Harris and the Democrats find new ways to make us pay. For what? No matter what we do, Democrats are against us. So this November, we\u2019re against them,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>Across the key Rust belt states, Trump has a clear lead on two of the most important issues for many voters, the economy and immigration. He is even ahead by one point on which candidate would better preserve democracy, despite his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, according to the <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3913\">Quinnipiac poll</a>.</p> \n<p>Behind the scenes, Democratic strategists are increasingly alarmed by the numbers. The party\u2019s US Senate candidate in Michigan, Elissa Slotkin, warned last month that Harris was not polling as well as expected.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling my best right now about where we are on Kamala Harris in a place like Michigan,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/election-michigan-harris\">told a fundraiser</a>. \u201cWe have her underwater in our polling.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some Democratic campaigners blame the campaign.</p> \n<p>Carly Hammond is an organiser for the US\u2019s largest trade union confederation, the AFL-CIO, for the Saginaw region who is running for city council while also canvassing for Harris.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the most expensive election in American politics so far. There\u2019s more money around, more ads, more signs, the volunteers are there. I really haven\u2019t seen anything like this in terms of the mobilisation efforts,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat is missing is Harris\u2019s policies. People ask: \u2018What is she going to do?\u2019 I\u2019ve heard about 200 Harris ads in the past few weeks just because they\u2019re inescapable. But I couldn\u2019t tell you what her concrete plan is to tackle anything.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some of the Democratic messaging in Michigan plays to Trump\u2019s agenda, with repeated promises to \u201csecure the border\u201d even though Saginaw is 1,500 miles from the Mexican frontier and undocumented immigrants make up only about 1% of the state\u2019s population. But it does not appear to be doing Harris much good while alienating some Democrats.</p> \n<p>Hammond said she feared that Harris had retreated into defensive messaging and a reliance on scaring voters over Trump\u2019s ties to Project 2025, the authoritarian plan to impose rightwing control across the entire US government, that is costing her momentum.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen it switched over from Biden to Harris, there was an expectation that Harris would put out her own aggressive policy proposals and that hasn\u2019t happened. There\u2019s been a kind of walking back. Harris\u2019s campaign said she\u2019s going to take on the billionaires and corporate interest rates. A lot of that language fell off and now it\u2019s just kind of \u2018Project 2025, it really sucks\u2019,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Trump, on the other hand, has been hitting the state with hard promises even if they\u2019re unlikely to be fulfilled. He told his audience in Saginaw he would make Michigan the \u201ccar capital of the world again\u201d after General Motors closed a dozen factories in the county and moved some production to Mexico.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnder my plan American workers will no longer be worried about losing their jobs to foreign nations. Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America. We\u2019re bringing them all back,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Large numbers of Trump voters don\u2019t believe it will happen, not least because he made the same promise in 2016 and the factories didn\u2019t return. But they apparently don\u2019t care.</p> \n<p>Gary Ell, chair of Saginaw\u2019s Republican party and a fervent Trump backer, said his supporters take the promise alone as evidence that the former president cares about them while the Democrats care about other people.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t look at him as being a politician. They still look at him as being an experienced former president who still stands on the same policies that he stood for before with the exception that the economy has gotten so much worse and the migration of mass illegal aliens has gotten so much worse. Those are two things that he had in check when he was president before,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Biden boasts of a booming economy, including record job growth, but statistics mean little to large numbers of Americans who feel much worse off after years of surging inflation. Saginaw\u2019s largest food bank has just received a $1m grant to expand because so many families are buckling under high grocery prices.</p> \n<p>Still, the Harris campaign has been encouraged by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/28/us/elections/times-siena-michigan-crosstabs.html\">data</a> showing the vice-president gaining ground with white voters without college degrees in Michigan, a key part of Trump\u2019s base.</p> \n<p>In a move to shore that up, Democratic heavyweights from out of state, including the former US senator from Indiana Joe Donnelly, descended on Saginaw last Wednesday to tell trade union members that Biden had been good for blue collar workers and Harris would be too.</p> \n<p>The area\u2019s member of Congress, Dan Kildee, warned the workers that Trump\u2019s false promises could cost them their jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a union hall where everybody\u2019s working because the Biden-Harris administration has invested in American manufacturing. When Donald Trump was president, we were losing these jobs. Sixty per cent of these people were unemployed. Under Biden-Harris, they\u2019re back to work. So, the question is, are we going to continue on this path or are we going to go back to those days?\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The Harris camp also brought Sanders to Saginaw to get out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/kamala-harris-election-michigan\">the student vote</a> with a rally at the local university. He said that Trump\u2019s denial of the climate crisis threatened the future of the planet and warned that another Trump presidency could be a decisive blow to a democracy already undermined by a growing oligarchy.</p> \n<p>Sanders also mocked Trump for losing the support of his own vice-president, Mike Pence.</p> \n<p>\u201cMike Pence is a very conservative guy. His views are nothing like mine. I disagree with him on every issue.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s supporters do not pitch up at his rallies expecting to hear policy speeches or even the truth. Mostly they go for the comfort of distractions from hard realities and the allure of false promises to revive the past. But some of the loudest cheers at Trump\u2019s recent rally in Saginaw, Michigan, came in response to a claim the former US president\u2019s supporters could believe, when he said election polls were swinging his way in the battleground state and that Kamala Harris\u2019s \u201choneymoon period\u201d was over. \u201cWe\u2019re up in all of the polls. We\u2019re up in every swing state. They had a honeymoon period,\u201d he said before he was drowned out by the cheering crowd. With just three weeks left until the election, Democrats fear that Trump is right. Some complain that Harris has squandered an initial burst of enthusiasm after Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, which sparked a surge in fundraising and volunteering for her campaign. Michigan is one of the handful of key swing states that will decide the result of this most momentous of elections. While Harris has a slight lead in national polls, she is struggling in Michigan, a state she must win or face a more challenging path through the US\u2019s electoral college to take the White House. Trump won the state by just 10,704 in 2016 and lost it by a narrow margin to Biden four years later. The stakes are enormous. Trump has campaigned in 2024 on an ever more extreme platform, threatening mass deportations of immigrants and promising to seek revenge on his political enemies if he returns to the White House. Last week, Trump even demanded one of America\u2019s big television networks lose its licence because he sees its political coverage as unfair to him. In a country that prides itself on free speech, freedom of the press could ail quickly under a second Trump term. For many, US democracy itself feels on the line. The Harris campaign has long considered its easiest path to victory is by winning the Rust belt battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If the vice-president were to lose in Michigan, she would almost certainly need to win one of the other closely contested states of Georgia, Arizona or North Carolina. A Quinnipiac University poll released last Wednesday put the vice-president three points behind Trump in Michigan, while poll trackers offer a mixed picture. For those desperate to know which way Michigan might go, it is Saginaw that is the bellwether county of the state. Barack Obama won it twice before Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the county by a little more than 1,000 votes, just over 1% of the ballot, in 2016. Four years later, Biden took Saginaw county from Trump by an even narrower margin of just 303 votes. Both campaigns are piling resources into Michigan including a deluge of frantic television advertising, and a merry-go-round of candidates and prominent supporters wheeling through the state. Harris\u2019s running mate, Tim Walz, was in Detroit on Friday looking to win over blue-collar union voters. The vice-president is expected in Detroit on Tuesday in a bid to turn out Black voters who are key to a Democratic victory in Michigan. The Harris campaign has wheeled out Barack Obama in recent days and sent Bernie Sanders, the darling of the left of the Democratic party, to rally student support in Saginaw a week ago. Meanwhile Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, traversed Michigan promising to bring back the old and attacking the new. Vance joked to an audience in Detroit on Tuesday about the importance of the state: \u201cI\u2019m going to be in Michigan like 30 times\u201d before the election. The pair have repeatedly pledged to make the American car industry great again, after so many jobs were lost to globalisation and automation, while attacking its future by scorning electric vehicles. Trump\u2019s rally in Saginaw leaned heavily on promises to bring back the dozen or so auto factories in the county that have closed in recent years. Alongside the fantasy promises is a darker campaign aimed at those who do not fit the view of what many Trump supporters think an American should look like. Some of it is dressed up as opposition to illegal immigration but groups supporting Trump are running television ads with sinister overtones in Michigan, including one paid for by Duty to America that shows a series of photographs of white people who are said to have been \u201cleft behind\u201d. \u201cEven if we do everything right, Harris and the Democrats find new ways to make us pay. For what? No matter what we do, Democrats are against us. So this November, we\u2019re against them,\u201d it said. Across the key Rust belt states, Trump has a clear lead on two of the most important issues for many voters, the economy and immigration. He is even ahead by one point on which candidate would better preserve democracy, despite his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, according to the Quinnipiac poll. Behind the scenes, Democratic strategists are increasingly alarmed by the numbers. The party\u2019s US Senate candidate in Michigan, Elissa Slotkin, warned last month that Harris was not polling as well as expected. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling my best right now about where we are on Kamala Harris in a place like Michigan,\u201d she told a fundraiser. \u201cWe have her underwater in our polling.\u201d Some Democratic campaigners blame the campaign. Carly Hammond is an organiser for the US\u2019s largest trade union confederation, the AFL-CIO, for the Saginaw region who is running for city council while also canvassing for Harris. \u201cThis is the most expensive election in American politics so far. There\u2019s more money around, more ads, more signs, the volunteers are there. I really haven\u2019t seen anything like this in terms of the mobilisation efforts,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is missing is Harris\u2019s policies. People ask: \u2018What is she going to do?\u2019 I\u2019ve heard about 200 Harris ads in the past few weeks just because they\u2019re inescapable. But I couldn\u2019t tell you what her concrete plan is to tackle anything.\u201d Some of the Democratic messaging in Michigan plays to Trump\u2019s agenda, with repeated promises to \u201csecure the border\u201d even though Saginaw is 1,500 miles from the Mexican frontier and undocumented immigrants make up only about 1% of the state\u2019s population. But it does not appear to be doing Harris much good while alienating some Democrats. Hammond said she feared that Harris had retreated into defensive messaging and a reliance on scaring voters over Trump\u2019s ties to Project 2025, the authoritarian plan to impose rightwing control across the entire US government, that is costing her momentum. \u201cWhen it switched over from Biden to Harris, there was an expectation that Harris would put out her own aggressive policy proposals and that hasn\u2019t happened. There\u2019s been a kind of walking back. Harris\u2019s campaign said she\u2019s going to take on the billionaires and corporate interest rates. A lot of that language fell off and now it\u2019s just kind of \u2018Project 2025, it really sucks\u2019,\u201d she said. Trump, on the other hand, has been hitting the state with hard promises even if they\u2019re unlikely to be fulfilled. He told his audience in Saginaw he would make Michigan the \u201ccar capital of the world again\u201d after General Motors closed a dozen factories in the county and moved some production to Mexico. \u201cUnder my plan American workers will no longer be worried about losing their jobs to foreign nations. Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America. We\u2019re bringing them all back,\u201d he said. Large numbers of Trump voters don\u2019t believe it will happen, not least because he made the same promise in 2016 and the factories didn\u2019t return. But they apparently don\u2019t care. Gary Ell, chair of Saginaw\u2019s Republican party and a fervent Trump backer, said his supporters take the promise alone as evidence that the former president cares about them while the Democrats care about other people. \u201cThey don\u2019t look at him as being a politician. They still look at him as being an experienced former president who still stands on the same policies that he stood for before with the exception that the economy has gotten so much worse and the migration of mass illegal aliens has gotten so much worse. Those are two things that he had in check when he was president before,\u201d he said. Biden boasts of a booming economy, including record job growth, but statistics mean little to large numbers of Americans who feel much worse off after years of surging inflation. Saginaw\u2019s largest food bank has just received a $1m grant to expand because so many families are buckling under high grocery prices. Still, the Harris campaign has been encouraged by data showing the vice-president gaining ground with white voters without college degrees in Michigan, a key part of Trump\u2019s base. In a move to shore that up, Democratic heavyweights from out of state, including the former US senator from Indiana Joe Donnelly, descended on Saginaw last Wednesday to tell trade union members that Biden had been good for blue collar workers and Harris would be too. The area\u2019s member of Congress, Dan Kildee, warned the workers that Trump\u2019s false promises could cost them their jobs. \u201cThis is a union hall where everybody\u2019s working because the Biden-Harris administration has invested in American manufacturing. When Donald Trump was president, we were losing these jobs. Sixty per cent of these people were unemployed. Under Biden-Harris, they\u2019re back to work. So, the question is, are we going to continue on this path or are we going to go back to those days?\u201d he said. The Harris camp also brought Sanders to Saginaw to get out the student vote with a rally at the local university. He said that Trump\u2019s denial of the climate crisis threatened the future of the planet and warned that another Trump presidency could be a decisive blow to a democracy already undermined by a growing oligarchy. Sanders also mocked Trump for losing the support of his own vice-president, Mike Pence. \u201cMike Pence is a very conservative guy. His views are nothing like mine. I disagree with him on every issue. But he worked with Trump every single day and he said Trump is not fit to be president of the United States,\u201d Sanders told a standing-room-only crowd. Some Michigan Republicans are pushing a similar message. A former member of Congress from Detroit, Dave Trott, and other anti-Trump conservatives launched Michigan Republicans for Harris-Walz earlier this month, aimed at the more than 350,000 Republicans in Michigan who voted against the former president in their party\u2019s primary in February. Trott accused Trump of \u201cgutting Michigan\u2019s economy\u201d and called him \u201cmore dangerous than ever\u201d. It\u2019s not clear if any of this is changing anyone\u2019s vote. Both camps are focused on turnout, knowing that it is likely to decide the election. Trump\u2019s support in Michigan went up in 2020 but he was beaten because many of those Democrats who stayed home when Clinton was the candidate four years earlier came out to remove him from the White House. Trump has been restating his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen in urging supporters to vote in order to make the election \u201ctoo big to rig\u201d. Harris is counting on the enthusiasm initially generated by her campaign, particularly among young female voters. Ultimately, the election in Michigan may be decided by events half a world away. More than 100,000 people voted uncommitted in the state\u2019s Democratic primaries in February in a protest against Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, as the Palestinian civilian death toll climbed into the tens of thousands. But the Uncommitted movement is now alarmed at the prospect of those supporters boycotting Harris if it delivers Michigan to Trump. On Tuesday, the group\u2019s co-founder Lexi Zeidan pleaded in a video on social media to not let that happen. \u201cAs a Palestinian American, the current administration\u2019s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising, but the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [the Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map,\u201d she said. Zeidan\u2019s warning fell well short of an endorsement of Harris but across Michigan, the vice-president\u2019s campaign is counting on fear of Trump as much as enthusiasm for the vice-president to get her over the line.",

Pat Anderson\u2019s rallying cry on the eve of the anniversary came at the close of an hour-long online event for key yes advocates to reflect, lament and commit to \u201cstay true to Uluru\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity here to actually turn Australia into an authentic Australian nation,\u201d Anderson told the online audience, \u201cwith people who are proud and respectful and acknowledge each other, and can go forward with all the energy that we have in this country and all the resources that this wonderful country has to offer to us.\u201d Anderson, an Alyawarre woman, joined other participants in the 2017 Uluru dialogues in reflecting on the process that had created the Uluru statement from the heart and its three ambitions \u2013 voice, treaty and truth \u2013 and then the brutal defeat of last year\u2019s attempt to realise the first. Anderson lamented that Australia still couldn\u2019t \u201chave the hard conversations\u201d. She said the Uluru statement was \u201ca guide, a roadmap to how we can all move forward as a sophisticated nation\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThe Uluru statement from the heart was a gift of love,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a gift of hope. It was a gift of asking you to join us. And the most of you rejected it. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to stop, because this is our place. And as I said, we ain\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d She said Indigenous Australians would keep inviting the rest of the nation \u201casking you, begging you almost, to see our point of view, to respect us, to acknowledge us\u201d. Participants in the event thanked the 6.2 million Australians \u2013 the 40% of the population \u2013 who voted yes and emphasised that 80% of Indigenous Australians were among them. \u201cThis is a really quite emotional time for us,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAnd I just wanted to take the opportunity to ask us to think bigger and wider and to be grand and to be fantastic. We have all the resources to do it. So let\u2019s grab it and do it anyhow.\u201d The youth dialogues co-chair and Cobble Cobble woman Allira Davis became emotional praising the elders who led the campaign. \u201cAs young people, we had the best leaders to lead the way forward and keep leading the way forward until we are given the torch to fight the good fight,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Anderson spoke of Indigenous mothers who warned their children that if they encountered police, they should be polite, answer the questions and not make trouble. It was, she said \u201cabhorrent racism\u201d, which put them at risk just for being Aboriginal. \u201cWe tell our kids, especially our boys, the same message every Friday night, every time they go out,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this has to stop.\u201d She called for structural reform so Indigenous people could move forward. \u201cSo we are not at the arse end of society, that we can take our proper place, that we are not excluded, that we can contribute to the nation in a way that we already do but it seems to be unrecognised.\u201d The dialogues co-chair and Cobble Cobble woman Prof Megan Davis said that with greater public education about misinformation, Australians were beginning to understand \u201cwe didn\u2019t get a fair go last year\u201d. \u201cMainstream politics is now moving to protect itself,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut we were exposed to a lot of political lies and misinformation that scuttled our people\u2019s attempt to finally do what wasn\u2019t done in 1788, 1901 and 1967,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re still here.\u201d Davis said that since the time of colonisation there still had been \u201cno settlement to the original grievance\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re still fighting for.\u201d The dialogues elder and Wiradjuri man Geoff Scott said while the referendum question was ultimately rejected, the process of talking about the proposal around the country had been positive. \u201cIt was about unity,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about division. It was about a real way forward and understanding why we wanted to do it. And it\u2019s for our kids, for the children, it\u2019s for the elders, but it\u2019s also about for the whole nation, about bringing us together.\u201d Anderson was the last of the speakers, some of whom said the online gathering was held on the anniversary\u2019s eve to give some Indigenous leaders space on the day itself. Addressing her remarks to the whole nation, Anderson explained, again, what the voice was about. \u201cOur mob across the country wanted structural reform,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to change in the relationship between you and and all of us. Our very lives and our existence actually depend upon it.\u201d",

The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, will take a plan for seven Commonwealth-owned nuclear power stations to the next election. That includes two in Queensland, replacing existing coal plants at Callide and Tarong. But an obscure provision in Queensland\u2019s 17-year-old Nuclear Facilities Prohibition Act 2007 may stand in the way.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The state opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has repeatedly ruled out changes to the law, most recently at a joint press conference with Dutton this month. Miles said if Dutton won the federal election, whoever was Queensland premier would be required under law to hold a plebiscite. \u201cThe law of Queensland requires a plebiscite if it looks like the Australian government\u2019s going to try to build a nuclear facility,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve said that I\u2019ll do everything I can to stand in the way of the most expensive option, that includes letting Queenslanders have their say. \u201cObviously, if I\u2019ve won the election, they\u2019ll have had their say, that will be a mandate for my position, which is for the cheaper option of storing renewables using pumped hydro. \u201cBut also the LNP leader claims he\u2019s not going to change the law either, and so I assume that means he intends to hold a plebiscite as well.

The Victorian and New South Wales parliaments passed bans on nuclear power in the 1980s, and the commonwealth parliament did so in 1999. Dutton has yet to reveal many details of his plan, including the cost. Guardian Australia understands the state government had examined holding a plebiscite at the state election on 26 October. Queensland is legally permitted to hold referendums on any issue and states have called referendums at federal elections in the past. In 1910 Queenslanders voted in a state referendum on religious education in schools plus a federal referendum, and a federal election, on the same day. Since 1922 states require approval by the governor general, who has only given it once: for the 1998 Northern Territory referendum on statehood. Queensland\u2019s last referendum, held in 2016, required state elections to be held every four years on fixed dates.

It\u2019s Sailing Jim/John, but not as we know it. This is Foiling, a totally different concept. If the actual hull of the actual boat is in actual contact with the actual water, actually that\u2019s probably going to cost you the race. What they do is hugely impressive, as it should be given the investment required, but even Ainslie said it, it is very much a push-button and timing sport nowadays. You don\u2019t see hands on deck heaving ropes and dodging the boom, much less on-the-fly to balance the boat. All that is controlled by the on-board tech, plus the in-race tech-support back in Blighty. I\u2019m sure the crew work super hard, they all look well fit, but you only ever see them in their cockpits helmeted-up. I\u2019m an old skule kind of person (vinyl music, real books, craft beer, sturdy lace-ups and sensible brogues...) and I\u2019d be much more inclined to sign up for live TV coverage if the boats were actually sailing on the water, with actual sails, hoisted by actual people using actual ropes, teamwork, and timing, dodging the actual boom.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Burgen reports from Barcelona. They will come back on Monday for a single-race day, 2pm local time in Barcelona. The crucial moment of the race we did get to see. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on that first race: BARCELONA, Oct 13 (Reuters) - New Zealand won the third America\u2019s Cup race against Britain on Sunday to take a 3-0 lead in the first-to-seven series, after a near collision between the two before the start. Ben Ainslie\u2019s British team were penalised after failing to keep clear in response to an aggressive close-quarters manoeuvre by Peter Burling\u2019s New Zealand crew in the pre-start. \u201cIt was a little bit uncomfortable .. with how close the boats got,\u201d Burling said laughing on the America\u2019s Cup live broadcast immediately after the end of the race off Barcelona. Burling said the New Zealand team had been \u201cworking on little bits and pieces\u201d in preparing to defend the America\u2019s Cup against Britain, which won the right to challenge them. The 33-year-old Kiwi skipper said it was \u201cgreat to finally execute it in a race ... and to make it count\u201d. Britain had to drop 75 metres behind the Kiwis after crossing the line to shake off the penalty, handing the America\u2019s Cup holders an early advantage. \u201cIt was obviously a port-starboard and we thought we were keeping clear but the umpires didn\u2019t see it that way,\u201d Ainslie said of the decision to impose a penalty on the British, who were the give-way boat under the rules of racing in sailing. Despite coming close to overtaking during an early tacking duel, the British were unable to get past and the New Zealanders sailed away from them for a convincing win at the finish. So, with the wind dropping, there\u2019s no more racing today. It\u2019s 3-0 to New Zealand. Perhaps that helps the Ineos team; they can go back to the drawing board. And maybe hope for a better start than almost crashing into their opponent. New Zealand appear in control, and are opening up a gap of over 100m. The wind is helping them along, as it\u2019s coming to them first ahead of the British team. Their speed is greater, too as the Brits have to negotiate the dirty air. New Zealand take the first leg, with 24 seconds in it. It appears the TV decided to show the opening race from Saturday. Racing has been abandoned for the day\u2026. Ok, the wind situation is that we go again in eight minutes. The race will start at 15.23 \u2013 that\u2019s ten minutes more. The lower wind limit has been passed. So we wait for it to pick back up. Make that another few minutes. They are waiting on the wind. It has dropped. We\u2019re blow the knots required for a race. Meanwhile, the boats/foils throb. The next race is in around five minutes. The sea state the same as before, and the wind is dropping. The boats are circling each other. Jeremy Boyce gets in touch: \u201cAs I was discussing with Dom yesterday, I\u2019m enjoying the racing, but with reservations. It\u2019s Sailing Jim/John, but not as we know it. This is Foiling, a totally different concept. If the actual hull of the actual boat is in actual contact with the actual water, actually that\u2019s probably going to cost you the race. What they do is hugely impressive, as it should be given the investment required, but even Ainslie said it, it is very much a push-button and timing sport nowadays. You don\u2019t see hands on deck heaving ropes and dodging the boom, much less on-the-fly to balance the boat. All that is controlled by the on-board tech, plus the in-race tech-support back in Blighty. I\u2019m sure the crew work super hard, they all look well fit, but you only ever see them in their cockpits helmeted-up. I\u2019m an old skule kind of person (vinyl music, real books, craft beer, sturdy lace-ups and sensible brogues...) and I\u2019d be much more inclined to sign up for live TV coverage if the boats were actually sailing on the water, with actual sails, hoisted by actual people using actual ropes, teamwork, and timing, dodging the actual boom. Mark my words, it will all come back. As the Americans say \u201cWhat goes around, comes around\u201d.\u201d Against Modern Sailing. #ams Team Ineos have 30 minutes or so to turn this around. The recriminations from that near-crash will just have to wait. The race penalty of 75m was so costly. \u201cKeep plugging, guys, long way to go with this,\u201d says Ben Ainslie. New Zealand only need four more wins. Peter Burling, Kiwi captain. \u201cIt was uncomfortable how close the boats got\u2026.it was great to make it count.\u201d Ben Ainslie again: \u201cA tough call. It felt we were keeping clear but the umpires didn\u2019t see it that way. We shall have a look at the conditions.\u201d He then swats away the Kiwi commentator who suggests the New Zealand boat might be superior to the Ineos. The commentator demures. Plain-sailing for New Zealand. \u201cA real nice breeze\u201d is heard from their crew. It\u2019s been theirs from the start. The lead is 600m, almost unassailable. The Brits have been beaten by a more aggressive, more disciplined team. They\u2019re going much slower, too. They almost idle to the finish line. Job done. That\u2019s 3-0. The Ineos Britannia turns and makes its way for the final two legs. A vast margin to make up. Rob Wilson, GB coach on that penalty. \u201cWe\u2019re just hanging in there, they\u2019re sailing cleanly.\u201d That near-clash of foils at the start could have ruined the day as a whole. The NZ boat seems to be able to speed away from its tacks. A feat of engineering beyond Big Sir Jim\u2019s men, it seems. The final leg is cut down to 1.2 nautical miles as the Kiwi team turns for home at the end of leg five. All smiles in the Kiwi camp. What can Britannia produce? Clipped conversation between their co-helm. The lead is 450m or so. Huge. They\u2019ve managed this well. Perhaps only the wind dropping can stop them. They approach the bottom gate to sure through with a clear lead after leg four. Into the third leg, and Ineos Britannia is going quicker. The problem is the dirty air coming off their opponents. Ben Ainslie is quiet. Too quiet? That start has hobbled the Britannia. He was steering when it happened. New Zealand are staying well away, out of danger, in full control they lead coming out of leg three. The crowd is huge in Barcelona, lots of Union Jacks but the Kiwis\u2019 boat is extending its lead. The race committee shorten the course as the conditions ease. The New Zealand team are pedalling for their lives. They have the bigger gybe, and that\u2019s helping them along. They take a clear lead after the second leg, a very big lead. It\u2019s theirs to lose already. New Zealand set off at a faster rate of knots, GB drop those 75m behind to clear the penalty, and that\u2019s a good recovery as they give chase. The gap is down to 54m. \u201cStand by,\u201d says Dylan Fletcher as they seek a chance to pass. The New Zealand team tack left, and that slows the British. They drop to 100m down, then 130m down. This is only the first leg after which New Zealand lead. So, both teams are primed and ready, launched into the bay, ready to start tacking. They nearly crash into each other ahead of the start. The Brits gets a 75m penalty from the start. Whoops. The race is due in just a couple of minutes, good to go. What can Britannia do? And more from Stephen: \u201cA friend skippering boat for tourists says conditions very different from yesterday, sea much more choppy.\u201d The talk from the British team is of a battery problem ahead of racing. The sea is said to be flatter, and they are expecting to get the first race underway. The second could be a victim of a drop in conditions. A \u201clight-air battle\u201d. Stephen Burgen is our man on the ground in Barcelona: \u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting: Not everyone is happy about the America\u00b4s Cup being staged here. Two hours before racing began, thousands of people - 10,000 according to the organisers - joined a protest organised by the \u201cNo to the America\u2019s Cup\u201d campaign. The campaign is also bringing a case to the anti-fraud office claiming that the organisers have made false and grossly inflated claims about the economic benefits to the city of hosting the event.\u201d So how does it work? Teams must first compete in a series of regattas, culminating in the Louis Vuitton Cup, which determines the main event\u2019s challenger. This year\u2019s matchup will see Team New Zealand as the defender take on Ineos Britannia after the Britons won the right to challenge New Zealand by beating Italy\u2019s Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli comfortably in the decisive race. The current format features a best of 13 series; the first to win seven races takes home the Cup. This year\u2019s edition begins with the first two races on 12 October. After that, the third and fourth races are set for 13 October. Subsequent races will occur on 16 October for the fifth and sixth races and on 18 October for the seventh. If necessary, the eighth race will be held on 18 October, the ninth and 10th on 19 October, the 11th and 12th on 20 October. The final race, if required, will take place on 21 October. Tale of the tape here. Important piece by Nick Ames on the Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe sporting empire. Saturday didn\u2019t go well for Sir Ben Ainslie and his crew. While they were winning the Louis Vuitton Cup, the New Zealand team were clearly working on their craft. So, 2-0 to the Kiwis and Team Ineos Britannia really need to salvage something from Sunday to keep their heads above water. We start to race at 1pm, UK time. Join me.",

Here\u2019s today\u2019s WSL roundup to conclude with. It was a strange game in truth and the stats will not reflect the scoreline. But that\u2019s a testament to the quality of United\u2019s finishing, in particular that of Elisabeth Terland. Her two expert finishes just before half-time truly defined this game \u2013 after that Spurs were always chasing it and, despite the amount of possession they enjoyed and the set-pieces they had, they couldn\u2019t find a way past Tullis-Joyce and the hosts\u2019 defence. It\u2019s a third successive win to nil for United in the league; they join Chelsea as the only sides to have won three from three in the WSL so far this season. Spurs look more like a mid-table side than one that will be pushing for Europe, even though they showed promise at times this afternoon. Here\u2019s the penalty from the United skipper that put gloss on the scoreline. That\u2019s it. A straightforward victory for United in the end and it\u2019s all smiles for Marc Skinner\u2019s side and the crowd at Leigh Sports Village. It finishes Manchester United 3-0 Tottenham. 90 min + 5: It\u2019s another fine save from Tullis-Joyce, with Spence trying her luck from distance this time. She just can\u2019t find a way past the United shot-stopper. 90 min + 4: Tullis-Joyce sprawls to deny Spence, whose shot isn\u2019t powerful enough to trouble the United keeper. The American keeper is another United player who has shone like a beacon today. 90 min + 3: Gabby George shepherds the ball out of play; she\u2019s typified the kind of defensive resilience United have shown this afternoon, with Le Tissier barely putting a foot wrong either. They simply will not concede a goal. 90 min: A whopping eight minutes are added on at LSV. Have the officials no mercy on Tottenham? 89 min: Lenna Gunning-Williams replaces Jessica Naz, who has ran herself into the ground today. 87 min: Both managers can still be heard barking instructions at their players from the sidelines. United will be desperate to keep another clean sheet, while Spurs probably deserve at least one goal. 85 min: Bizet has taken a knock to the head from a stray elbow. She\u2019s a tough cookie though and shakes it off. She\u2019s done really well this afternoon for United at right-back, it must be said. 82 min: The pace has dropped from this game now, with United happy to operate on the counter and Spurs just short of ideas and motivation, you sense. 79 min: Vinberg turns, shoots and demands another Spurs corner for a deflection. There\u2019s nothing doing in every sense. 78 min: Neville flashes a shot across the face of goal. Time is running out for Tottenham. 76 min: That comes to nothing and United will now make a triple change. Hinata Miyazawa, Rachel Williams and Simi Awujo are on, with Elisabeth Terland, Ella Toone and Lisa Naaslund going off. There\u2019s a deserved standing ovation for Terland from the fans at LSV. 74 min: Spurs have their eighth corner of the afternoon and England goes close, flicking a header that balloons over to the back post, with Galton heading it off the line. Time for a ninth corner\u2026 72 min: Ashley Neville with a well-timed challenge on Galton. That potentially stopped a goal; the United winger was bearing down on goal. 4-0 to the hosts now looks more likely than 3-1. 71 min: Clinton hustles and harries and forces the mistake from Hunt and Toone should do better once Terland has fed her. The England forward blazes it over. 69 min: If Spurs get a goal now\u2026 (They no longer really look like getting one). 67 min: Thomas hasn\u2019t given up, to be fair to her, she\u2019s still running the channels down the left, with Vinberg also making her presence felt down that side now. 64 min: United may have a problem, with Clinton down on her haunches and receiving some medical attention. Toone has been booked for a late challenge. 63 min: Spurs look completely sapped at the moment. I don\u2019t think they can quite believe they\u2019re 3-0 down. 60 min: I was surprised neither Toone nor Terland took that penalty, so the pressure was on Le Tissier to some extent. She didn\u2019t show any signs of feeling it. United surely have this wrapped up now. Ella Toone spots down the ball and, despite the fact Terland is on a hat-trick, Maya Le Tissier takes it. And the United captain makes no mistake, slotting it into the bottom right corner. Penalty United! Ashley Neville is adjudged to have handled in the area. 56 min: Spurs are making a fairly early change, as it looks like Summanen won\u2019t be able to continue. Matilda Vinberg is on. 54 min: United are exhibiting some fine buildup play now and they look the most likely to get the (crucial, obviously) next goal. 52 min: Skinner is talking to Bizet on the sideline. You have to say his decision to play the winger at right-back had borne fruit so far. She\u2019s put in two fine crosses for the United goals. Summanen has been getting some treatment on the field for Spurs. 50 min: Oh, United should have three and Terland should have a hat-trick, she\u2019s played clean through and hits the post. Spencer just about touched that onto the woodwork. 48 min: Spurs are keeping the ball well. Their problem so far has been a lack of cutting edge in the final third. 46 min: Spurs start the second half in much the same way they started the first \u2013 pressing high and winning set-pieces as United attempt to win it back. Second half: We go again. Can Spurs find a way back into this one? Here\u2019s Terland\u2019s second: Spurs should remember how well they\u2019ve played and, if they can, take heart. The link-up between Thomas and England has been effective, with Jessica Naz a consistent threat down the right too. The problem is they\u2019ve switched off at the back a couple of times and been punished by some ruthless finishing. I\u2019m off to grab a coffee and reflect on that first half. Manchester United 2-0 Tottenham. The visitors will feel completely shellshocked. They dominated for long periods in that first half but they now trail by two after two fine finishes from Terland. That\u2019s the price you can pay for profligacy, I guess. United\u2019s more clinical finishing has put them in control, on course for a third straight WSL victory, and Robert Vilahamn looks perplexed to say the least. A flowing United move and another fine goal for Terland, made by Bizet! Wow. Clinton held onto it nicely and laid the ball for Bizet to whip in from the right, in similar fashion to the first goal. This time Terland latches onto it with her head and Spencer has no chance. A fine double-salvo from the United striker. 45 min + 2: United almost scrambled one in from the corner but the referee blows up for a foul on Spencer. Tottenham will feel really aggrieved if they\u2019re trailing at the break. But United have had good spells in the half, especially in the past five to 10 minutes. 45 min: That\u2019s pretty special from Elisabeth Terland, her first United goal. And it will live long in the memory. I said it came on the stroke of half-time, but we\u2019ve got six added minutes now, as Terland has another effort blocked. United sense the chance to nick another. Terland on the stroke of half-time! United lead and it\u2019s against the run of play really. The Norwegian striker hasn\u2019t had much of a kick but it\u2019s a super volley to meet Bizet\u2019s fine cross from the right, with far too power for Spencer to keep it out. 41 min: United are least battling hard in midfield, in the face of a fierce Tottenham press. Can they conjure something before the interval? 38 min: As I type that, it nearly clicks for United, with Galton stretching to shoot following a good move down the left, but it\u2019s easily collected by Spencer. 37 min: Some United fans are chanting \u2018attack, attack, attack\u2019 \u2013 such has been their frustration at watching the home side\u2019s struggle to click into gear. Toone hasn\u2019t been in the game at all. Lisa Naalsund\u2019s passing has been one of the few bright spots for United in the opening 38 minutes. 35 min: Brilliant trickery from Thomas to evade her markers down the left, eventually crossing for England who cannot quite stoop to direct her header at goal. United are living increasingly dangerously, though. 33 min: Another Spurs set-piece, surely one of these will pay off soon \u2026 nope not this one. Summanen doesn\u2019t clear the first player and Janssen wallops clear. 31 min: Tullis-Joyce is OK. But the game has turned slightly scruffy, with United in particular struggling to string their passes together. The sun has peaked through the grey Leigh clouds though, which is pleasing. This has been United\u2019s best chance of the game: 27 min: The United keeper may well have been hurt while making that clearance. Looks like she took a hefty knock on the knee from England. She\u2019s down and needs treatment. 26 min: Spurs are getting a fair few set-pieces in this game, with Eveliina Summanen the player charged with getting the delivery right. Tullis-Joyce makes a strong punch from this latest corner, with Beth England lurking right under the ball. 24 min: It\u2019s almost a back three at times for United, with Bizet pushing high and wide into a wing-back role and Clinton playing narrow right midfield, while George stays back on the left side of a three-player defensive line. It\u2019s a fluid formation that\u2019s for sure and it\u2019s starting to pay off with United growing into the game. 22 min: Sarina Wiegman is in situ at Leigh Sports Village, pen in hand making notes and sporting a pair of pink trousers. 20 min: Marc Skinner said this would be tight before kick-off and it\u2019s proving that way, now that United have gained a foothold in the contest. 18 mins: Spurs break through Naz but they cannot make the most of the space afforded to them. Tullis-Joyce collects easily after a pot-shot from Ahtinen. 17 min: That\u2019s United\u2019s best chance of the game and it really ought to have gone in from Clinton. She hit it cleanly enough with her left foot but Becky Spencer produced a fine reaction save. 14 min: It\u2019s been a bit better in the past few minutes from United and it\u2019s largely thanks to the coolness of Dominique Janssen in midfield. She\u2019s the player that can help the hosts take better care of the ball and shift them upfield. 11 min: Super feet from England to draw in defenders and lay it off to Spence, who tries to curl a shot from 20 yards or so, which is just tipped over the crossbar by Tullis-Joyce. 10 min: A pattern has been established in this game. It goes like this: United try and pass it out from the back, Spurs press high and aggressively, win it back and fashion a chance of sorts. United need to break that cycle quickly. 8 min: Clare Hunt strikes the outside of the post with a header from a corner. There was never any real danger of it going in but still\u2026 Tottenham are on top. 7 min: Spurs are having a good spell early on and lots of their joy is coming down their left. I suspect Celin Bizet doesn\u2019t want to do a huge amount of defending but she\u2019s the nominal right-back for United and needs to help the likes of Le Tissier and Turner out. 5 min: Goodness me that\u2019s a big chance for Martha Thomas. She gets the better of Le Tissier, cutting in from the left, but the United keeper Tullis-Joyce stays tall and strong to make the stop. 3 min: United are looking to play through Spurs with short passes and quick exchanges in central areas. Toone looks to be playing the No 10 role to link it all together, with Clinton shifted out to the right. 1 min: It looks like Galton will play higher up rather than at left-back, where she\u2019s been stationed previously this season. Bizet is slotting in at right-back with Gabby George on the left side of the back four. Here we go, here we go. Back in the rather colder confines of Leigh, we\u2019re approaching kick-off time. What\u2019s your prediction for this one? I\u2019m going for a narrow United victory, 2-1 perhaps. A win for the hosts would ensure they join Chelsea as the only WSL side with a perfect record this season so far. Can they go three from three? Elsewhere in the world of elite women\u2019s sport today, there\u2019s the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup, if that\u2019s your bag. Vilahamn confirms Thomas will play on the left wing with England through the middle. The two are immensely talented but haven\u2019t played together for Spurs very much. Can they dovetail today? Tottenham\u2019s head coach Robert Vilahamn is speaking to Sky Sports before the game. He says his team must find the balance between scoring goals and keeping them out. \u201cWe need to make sure we don\u2019t give away set-pieces to score from.\u201d He adds that Beth England \u201cdeserves to start\u201d after the impact she\u2019s made off the bench in the past few matches. \u201cThese games are the ones we\u2019ve got to compete [in] to see if we can break into the Champions League, to challenge Man United. We\u2019re aiming for the Champions League in the long run.\u201d Marc Skinner has been delighted with United\u2019s fast start to the league season but says his team are still in transition, integrating new players after a busy summer. We\u2019re in a good space. We\u2019re still learning. I can tell that there are parts of our game that are not smooth but I\u2019ve been happy with our clean sheets. I think that\u2019s huge for us. We\u2019re embedding a new goalkeeper into a starting position. We\u2019re embedding new defenders, new midfielders, new forwards. We\u2019re playing some really exciting stuff and, even in training, I\u2019m starting to see little connections in players that haven\u2019t played together before. I think that is really important for us. It\u2019s still our style, but I just think you\u2019ll see individuals do things differently.\u201d And what of the challenge posed by Spurs? It\u2019s going to be an intriguing game. I won\u2019t take Tottenham ever lightly. I pay every team the respect they deserve and this is a team that can score goals, create chances, has great counter-attacking ability. We\u2019ve just got to try to control it as much as possible. It\u2019ll be a good game. It will be tight. Footage of footballers trotting across grass before a football match. A reminder that Melvine Malard is injured for United and it looks like she\u2019s been joined on the sidelines by Brazilian forward Geyse. The hosts still look pretty strong through, with Leah Galton continuing in her left back role and Celin Bizet coming into the forward line. For Spurs, it will be all about that link-up between Martha Thomas, Beth England and Jessica Naz up top. We\u2019re about 45 minutes from kick-off at Leigh. Manchester United: Tullis-Joyce; George, Turner, Le Tissier, Galton; Clinton, Janssen, Naaslund; Toone, Bizet, Terland. Tottenham: Spencer; Neville, Bartrip, Hunt, Grant; Summanen, Ahtinen, Spence; Naz, Thomas, England. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live Women\u2019s Super League offering. And it comes from Leigh Sports Village, where unbeaten Manchester United host Tottenham. OK, United have only played twice in the league so far this season, but with two wins from two confidence is high. Spurs have been a mixed bag with a win, a draw and a defeat from their three encounters so far. Grace Clinton is most certainly the player to watch today. The 21-year-old England prodigy is aiming become the first ever United player to score in each of their first three WSL appearances for the club. She showed huge promise on loan at Tottenham last season \u2013 so there\u2019s narrative for you. United boss Marc Skinner boasts a super record against Spurs, too, going seven games against them unbeaten. The game kicks off at 12.30pm (BST) and we\u2019ll bring you team news in the next post, so let\u2019s get stuck into this, shall we? Yes, let\u2019s.",

Sky Studios Elstree already has a new state-of-the art film and TV studio in Hertfordshire with 12 sound stages across 11 hectares (27.5 acres) , producing movies including Paddington in Peru and a version of the hit musical Wicked starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo.

It submitted a planning application to Hertsmere borough council in 2022 and in March the council narrowly rejected it.

      "body": "<p>Pacing his technical area with puffed cheeks, pursed lips and crossed arms, there was one of the most recognizable faces in club football, the unfamiliar sight of a USA badge on his lapel.</p> <p>At the final whistle, his brow unfurrowed by the delight of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/12/mauricio-pochettino-usmnt-debut-panama-friendly\">a 2-0 win over Panama</a> in his first game in charge of the US men\u2019s national team, Mauricio Pochettino bounded on to the field with a wide grin, glad-handing everyone in sight, with back-slaps, hugs and handshakes for all, from players to officials to a cameraman.</p> <p>If the US were in solid shape and on an upward trajectory the former Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea manager would not have been hired, so Saturday\u2019s result and performance, imperfect as it was, represented an immediate boost after a summer of setbacks. There were smiling faces on the pitch and in the stands of a noisy and nearly full stadium. After a string of poor results and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/01/usmnt-uruguay-copa-america-soccer-goal-offside-call\">a group stage exit from the Copa Am\u00e9rica</a> during which the US somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/02/gregg-berhalter-hasnt-lost-the-locker-room-but-he-should-lose-his-job\">looked both tempestuous and torpid</a>, this was positive. Different.</p> <p>Under Pochettino\u2019s predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, the US had become mired in an eternal learning process, always on a journey towards consistent excellence but never reaching that prized destination, even as the core group, many of them teenagers when he took charge, entered their mid-20s.</p> <p>Now it is time for some progress, with the co-hosts only 20 months away from the 2026 World Cup and the number of international windows remaining before the tournament down to single figures. Berhalter sourced the ingredients; Pochettino has to blend, cook and serve them in two summers\u2019 time. Preferably well-done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/13/kylian-mbappe-symbol-of-malaise-amid-france-generational-shift\">Kylian Mbapp\u00e9: the symbol of malaise amid France\u2019s generational shift</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think it was a very professional performance and I think we are happy because I think all the [targets] that we said before the game, I think that we got and I think it\u2019s an important victory,\u201d Pochettino told reporters.</p> <p>Panama, after all, in effect torpedoed Berhalter\u2019s long tenure with a wince-inducing 2-1 Copa win in June. The US have lost five times in 11 games in 2024, the most defeats in a calendar year since 2019, Berhalter\u2019s first year. Entering this friendly at Q2 Stadium in Austin the US had won only once in their past seven fixtures, back in June against Bolivia, South America\u2019s worst team.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a record that chimes with the view that the US are Concacaf\u2019s dominant force and have the potential to go deep in 2026 \u2013 a belief, surely, that helped convince the former Argentina defender to depart the club scene for his first foray into international management.</p> <p>Following his departure from Chelsea, Pochettino would surely have been offered a job before long at another top-tier European club. Instead he was in Texas in front of a crowd of 20,239, steering players of varying ability for a federation that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/09/10/sports/billionaire-ken-griffin-significant-part-of-usmnts-mauricio-pochettino-hire/\">tapped into a gift</a> from a Floridian hedge fund billionaire and Republican megadonor in order to cover his reported $6m annual salary.</p> <p>Pochettino <a href=\"https://www.goal.com/en/news/too-much-greatness-pochettino-admits-stars-messi-mbappe-neymar-psg-confusion/blt0eb422fc777eb642#\">observed in 2022</a> that in Paris, where he coached Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Lionel Messi and Neymar, a surfeit of superstars created problems. \u201cToo much greatness\u201d is not going to be an issue in this role. Only Christian Pulisic, with six goals in nine appearances for Milan this season, is in that category.</p> <p>A host of injuries to first-team regulars meant that Pochettino\u2019s lineup was by necessity a chance to cast his eye over players who were marginal contributors under Berhalter. There was no Gio Reyna, Tim Weah or Folarin Balogun to spark the attack. No Tyler Adams or Weston McKennie in midfield or Sergi\u00f1o Dest and Chris Richards in defense. Intriguingly, Tim Ream captained the side a week after his 37th birthday. Does Pochettino believe Ream could contribute at the World Cup despite his advanced age? Did he want some veteran leadership to provide stability in his first game? Did he have limited alternatives? Yes.</p> <p>Up front, Pochettino started Norwich City\u2019s Josh Sargent, who smashed an easy chance over the bar from eight yards in the first half.

      "bodyText": "Pacing his technical area with puffed cheeks, pursed lips and crossed arms, there was one of the most recognizable faces in club football, the unfamiliar sight of a USA badge on his lapel. At the final whistle, his brow unfurrowed by the delight of a 2-0 win over Panama in his first game in charge of the US men\u2019s national team, Mauricio Pochettino bounded on to the field with a wide grin, glad-handing everyone in sight, with back-slaps, hugs and handshakes for all, from players to officials to a cameraman. If the US were in solid shape and on an upward trajectory the former Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea manager would not have been hired, so Saturday\u2019s result and performance, imperfect as it was, represented an immediate boost after a summer of setbacks. There were smiling faces on the pitch and in the stands of a noisy and nearly full stadium. After a string of poor results and a group stage exit from the Copa Am\u00e9rica during which the US somehow looked both tempestuous and torpid, this was positive. Different. Under Pochettino\u2019s predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, the US had become mired in an eternal learning process, always on a journey towards consistent excellence but never reaching that prized destination, even as the core group, many of them teenagers when he took charge, entered their mid-20s. Now it is time for some progress, with the co-hosts only 20 months away from the 2026 World Cup and the number of international windows remaining before the tournament down to single figures. Berhalter sourced the ingredients; Pochettino has to blend, cook and serve them in two summers\u2019 time. Preferably well-done. \u201cI think it was a very professional performance and I think we are happy because I think all the [targets] that we said before the game, I think that we got and I think it\u2019s an important victory,\u201d Pochettino told reporters. Panama, after all, in effect torpedoed Berhalter\u2019s long tenure with a wince-inducing 2-1 Copa win in June. The US have lost five times in 11 games in 2024, the most defeats in a calendar year since 2019, Berhalter\u2019s first year. Entering this friendly at Q2 Stadium in Austin the US had won only once in their past seven fixtures, back in June against Bolivia, South America\u2019s worst team. It\u2019s not a record that chimes with the view that the US are Concacaf\u2019s dominant force and have the potential to go deep in 2026 \u2013 a belief, surely, that helped convince the former Argentina defender to depart the club scene for his first foray into international management. Following his departure from Chelsea, Pochettino would surely have been offered a job before long at another top-tier European club. Instead he was in Texas in front of a crowd of 20,239, steering players of varying ability for a federation that tapped into a gift from a Floridian hedge fund billionaire and Republican megadonor in order to cover his reported $6m annual salary. Pochettino observed in 2022 that in Paris, where he coached Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Lionel Messi and Neymar, a surfeit of superstars created problems. \u201cToo much greatness\u201d is not going to be an issue in this role. Only Christian Pulisic, with six goals in nine appearances for Milan this season, is in that category. A host of injuries to first-team regulars meant that Pochettino\u2019s lineup was by necessity a chance to cast his eye over players who were marginal contributors under Berhalter. There was no Gio Reyna, Tim Weah or Folarin Balogun to spark the attack. No Tyler Adams or Weston McKennie in midfield or Sergi\u00f1o Dest and Chris Richards in defense. Intriguingly, Tim Ream captained the side a week after his 37th birthday. Does Pochettino believe Ream could contribute at the World Cup despite his advanced age? Did he want some veteran leadership to provide stability in his first game? Did he have limited alternatives? Yes. Up front, Pochettino started Norwich City\u2019s Josh Sargent, who smashed an easy chance over the bar from eight yards in the first half. In doing so, Sargent perpetuated the sobering sense that \u2013 like Chris Wondolowski before him \u2013 he is an effective goal producer in a second-tier league who is unable to replicate his form reliably for the national team. The 24-year-old last scored for the US in 2019. Still, he would have seemed a better bet to find the net than Yunus Musah, employed as a defensive midfielder by Berhalter. After a busy but ineffective first half reminiscent of the pre-Poch era for its inability to subdue or carve apart decent and energetic opposition, the first goal under new management was scored by Musah: his maiden international strike in his 42nd cap. Here was a break from the past: Pochettino deployed Musah on the right wing and gave him license to attack. It was, the coach said, an attempt to reinvigorate a player with limited minutes for Milan this season. \u201c[We] tried to build his confidence maybe from starting in a different position than he was starting in the past. I think that was a good decision,\u201d Pochettino told reporters. The buildup to the 49th-minute goal was also a refreshing change, with evidence of teamwork and calculation that had often been lacking under Berhalter, when there seemed to be few offensive schemes beyond asking a pacy winger to charge at the defense and hoping to profit from whatever chaos might ensue. It was jarring, in a good way, to see Musah burst towards the six-yard box (a run that Sargent might have been expected to make) to finish off a cross from Pulisic, his club teammate, as if he\u2019d been doing it all his life. Panama then pressurized the US and had a couple of good chances to equalize before a relatively straightforward breakaway goal in injury-time sealed victory. Here, too, the identity of the goalscorer implied a deviation from earlier struggles, a period of new possibilities. Ricardo Pepi, a substitute, had not scored for his country for 11 months, but his shot found a way through the goalkeeper\u2019s legs. The shut-out and a couple of important saves by Matt Turner, whose career in England appears headed down a blind alley, also felt restorative. The atmosphere may change when Pochettino\u2019s honeymoon wears off: when players are marginalized and grow disillusioned, and later in the season when they are tired and carrying knocks and his intense training sessions and high pressing style seems like an exhausting imposition for footballers whose primary focus is naturally on the club game that absorbs the large majority of their time and provides nearly all of their income. The mood might even shift as soon as Tuesday, when the US visit Guadalajara for a friendly against Mexico that should provide a stiff test, not least since the Americans haven\u2019t played a match outside their own country since last November. But, despite the blemishes and elements of fortune, the win was what mattered most for a team that lost to Canada and drew with New Zealand in friendlies last month under an interim coach. It builds more trust in a manager whose past achievements already ensure he commands respect from players and fans, and it points the US in the direction of something different, something better.",

Kadija George Sesay, who was one of several writers to sign an open letter criticising the move, told the Guardian that she had returned her honorary fellowship to Goldsmiths.</p> <p>In the past decade, there were notable advances in the creation of dedicated lectureships, and broader curriculum development in black history, culture, politics and philosophy in higher education. This, as well as active mentoring and recruitment of academics of colour, led to improvements in the number of black professors in the UK.</p> <p>But universities say they are in the midst of a dire financial crisis and these courses, while expensive to run, are not as popular as they are in the US, where the discipline of black history and arts is more established.</p> <p>Campaigners say the courses and the lecturers\u2019 specialist knowledge should be ringfenced and require time and development to have an impact. Even with recent improvements, fewer than 1% of professors are black.</p> <p>Beckford said: \u201cThe reality is I\u2019ve never been in a job since 1993 which has been secure. I\u2019ve always had the threat of redundancy because there was always a lack of funding for posts that were connected to race. I\u2019ve never had that kind of luxury of knowing that I was in a place that was going to invest in me and give me lots of time to develop my craft.\u201d</p> <p>Beckford, who alone supported 16 black PhD students, added: \u201cYou get a freeze on the development and mentoring by jettisoning people like me. My work has always been fundamentally about empowering black students, empowering black colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>While the University of Winchester said it would not comment on individual cases, a spokesperson noted that \u201call the redundancies upon which we have consulted reflect the challenging financial circumstances facing the university sector\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Kehinde Andrews, who leads Birmingham City University\u2019s black studies department, said he was disappointed but not surprised when he was told the undergraduate course would be cut. \u201cThere\u2019s no appreciation for the importance of black intellectual thought, so they get rid of it really easily. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even call it erasure because there\u2019s so little black production in Britain. It\u2019ll be completely wiped out, there\u2019ll be nothing left.\u201d</p> <p>BCU declined to comment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/feb/04/ive-had-to-fight-kehinde-andrews-on-life-as-the-first-uk-professor-of-black-studies\">\u2018I\u2019ve had to fight\u2019: Kehinde Andrews on life as the first UK professor of Black studies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adi believes these cuts will have a dire impact on the number of black history professors in the UK.

      "bodyText": "Black scholarship in the UK risks being wiped out due to redundancies and course closures, leading academics have warned. Universities in England are engulfed in a financial crisis and have in response implemented a number of cost-cutting measures. But prominent academics and students are raising the alarm that these cuts are falling on lecturers and courses that played a leading role in addressing racial disparities in higher education. The University of Chichester made Prof Hakim Adi redundant and cut his MRes on the history of Africa and the African diaspora. Prof Robert Beckford, the well-known theologian who researched climate and social justice, has been made redundant at the University of Winchester, and Birmingham City University (BCU) shuttered its black studies undergraduate course. While Goldsmiths, University of London reversed plans to cut its Black British literature MA, stating it would commit to running the course for another two years after an outcry, it recently made the founder and convener of the course, Prof Deirdre Obsorne, redundant. Kadija George Sesay, who was one of several writers to sign an open letter criticising the move, told the Guardian that she had returned her honorary fellowship to Goldsmiths. In the past decade, there were notable advances in the creation of dedicated lectureships, and broader curriculum development in black history, culture, politics and philosophy in higher education. This, as well as active mentoring and recruitment of academics of colour, led to improvements in the number of black professors in the UK. But universities say they are in the midst of a dire financial crisis and these courses, while expensive to run, are not as popular as they are in the US, where the discipline of black history and arts is more established. Campaigners say the courses and the lecturers\u2019 specialist knowledge should be ringfenced and require time and development to have an impact. Even with recent improvements, fewer than 1% of professors are black. Beckford said: \u201cThe reality is I\u2019ve never been in a job since 1993 which has been secure. I\u2019ve always had the threat of redundancy because there was always a lack of funding for posts that were connected to race. I\u2019ve never had that kind of luxury of knowing that I was in a place that was going to invest in me and give me lots of time to develop my craft.\u201d Beckford, who alone supported 16 black PhD students, added: \u201cYou get a freeze on the development and mentoring by jettisoning people like me. My work has always been fundamentally about empowering black students, empowering black colleagues.\u201d While the University of Winchester said it would not comment on individual cases, a spokesperson noted that \u201call the redundancies upon which we have consulted reflect the challenging financial circumstances facing the university sector\u201d. Prof Kehinde Andrews, who leads Birmingham City University\u2019s black studies department, said he was disappointed but not surprised when he was told the undergraduate course would be cut. \u201cThere\u2019s no appreciation for the importance of black intellectual thought, so they get rid of it really easily. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing everywhere. \u201cYou can\u2019t even call it erasure because there\u2019s so little black production in Britain. It\u2019ll be completely wiped out, there\u2019ll be nothing left.\u201d BCU declined to comment. Adi believes these cuts will have a dire impact on the number of black history professors in the UK. The masters course he oversaw produced seven students who went on to undertake studies at PhD level, six of them at Chichester. \u201cWe were particularly trying to redress the imbalance in higher education: the fact that there were so few students of African and Caribbean heritage studying history at postgraduate level in this country,\u201d he said. The students on Adi\u2019s course have launched a legal challenge against the university, alleging discrimination and breach of contract after it terminated the programme while they were part way through their studies. A spokesperson for the University of Chichester said while it had made the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to suspend a number of courses, current masters students \u201cwere encouraged to complete their studies with us and were offered appropriate tuition\u201d. Osborne was heartbroken when her redundancy was confirmed earlier this month. \u201cWhat kind of message does removing opportunities for access to that knowledge send to students and future generations of black creatives?\u201d Dr Stephen Graham, Goldsmiths\u2019 executive dean of faculty, said the MA programme provided a crucial platform for black scholarship and increased diversity within the academic community. \u201cThese were the reasons both behind the creation of the MA programme and our persistence in supporting it in the face of low recruitment numbers,\u201d he said. He added he was aware of the concerns about the impact on black scholarship of the financial challenges universities face. A student on the Black British literature programme, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cI joined the course because of the professor, who is a leading academic in the space. I absolutely trusted her experience, vision and commitment \u2013 that has now been taken away. \u201cNew students have arrived from overseas who spoke to the professor, made a significant financial and personal commitment, and that professor is simply not there.\u201d Graham said: \u201cThe course is being taught by two leading black scholars and over the next two years we will work to develop a more multidisciplinary programme that will help in attracting more students.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Ellie used to wonder why she always felt drained after spending time with her friends. Then she noticed that they were constantly complaining about their jobs or their partners without ever taking steps to change. Or else they would select an unsuspecting victim and sink their teeth into them. They didn\u2019t want to hear about Ellie, 35 \u2013 the changes she was making in her life, the new business she had started. And they certainly didn\u2019t want to hear that it was going well, she says. \u201cYou almost felt like you couldn\u2019t fit in with them unless you were moaning about something.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe you have one of these characters in your life: an old school&nbsp;friend, perhaps, who consistently leaves you feeling worse than before you met up with them. In psychological shorthand, they are known as \u201cemotional vampires\u201d, for their ability to suck the pleasure from a social interaction \u2013 and your energy along with it. But what are the signs that you are in one\u2019s clutches, or that you have become one yourself? And how can we best handle such&nbsp;relationships?</p> <p>\u201cThere are some people who have an excessive need for attention and validation,\u201d says Suzy Reading, a psychologist and chartered member of the British Psychological Society. They are often overwhelmingly negative, or&nbsp;display a victim mentality, refusing to believe that anything that happens to them is their fault.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of times, they don\u2019t actually want solutions or advice&nbsp;\u2013 they just want to offload,\u201d says Reading. And while they might be intently focused on themselves, \u201cthere\u2019s not a great deal of self-awareness\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just their own patterns of&nbsp;behaviour that these individuals are oblivious to: emotional vampires are defined by their inability to empathise, leading them to vent their frustrations without thinking how it might affect or be received by the other&nbsp;person.</p>    <p>Carla Manly, a clinical psychologist based in California, says such behaviour reflects a lack of emotional intelligence. \u201cWhen somebody is an empathic human being, even if they have a high need, when they reach out for support, they will be aware of your emotional state first.\u201d They might ask you if now is a good time to talk, or pick up on cues that suggest it isn\u2019t. Emotional vampires pay no such mind, says Manly. \u201cThey are only caring for their own appetite, their own needs.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Any attempts to change the subject can be met with one-upmanship, dismissiveness or even hostility</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The key point is that the behaviour is consistent, even chronic, says Manly. There are many reasons a friend might temporarily be more demanding, or&nbsp;less present, such as after a breakup or a period of poor mental health. But in functional friendships, there is an underlying sense of give and take. \u201cWe want somebody to be invested as we are&nbsp;invested; a mutual reciprocity. It\u2019s not always 50-50, but overall there is a sense of&nbsp;balance.\u201d</p> <p>An emotional vampire will resist that equilibrium, betraying a fundamental egocentrism. Any attempts to change the subject can be met with one-upmanship, dismissiveness or even hostility. \u201cIf&nbsp;you do then challenge them on it, they\u2019re so resistant that you might end up getting attacked,\u201d says Reading.</p> <p>But to characterise one person as the predatory bloodsucker and the other as their hapless victim can be reductive. After all, vampires can\u2019t prey on just anyone: you have to invite them in. \u201cIf someone has managed to get into this position of being completely domineering, then obviously we\u2019ve allowed it to some extent, or&nbsp;possibly enabled it,\u201d says Jenny van Hooff, a sociologist at Manchester Metropolitan University.</p> <p>Even with the best of intentions, it can be all too easy to get sucked into the dynamic. Beth, 38, befriended a friend of a friend, wishing to support her through her first pregnancy. The younger woman struggled with her family and was not in contact with the father of her child and Beth thought she could help. But every time they spoke, Beth felt depleted, depressed and helpless. \u201cI started to realise that I\u2019d repeat the same things over and over again and she would never follow the suggestions, nor listen to me.\u201d</p> <p>When the woman started volunteering information about her childhood traumas, Beth felt that a line had been crossed. \u201cIt&nbsp;wasn\u2019t about the trauma per&nbsp;se, but the fact that she would \u2018vomit\u2019 information without really listening,\u201d she says. \u201cThe next time&nbsp;she called, I told her I only had&nbsp;15 minutes, and the time after that, I made up an excuse so that we&nbsp;wouldn\u2019t speak.\u201d</p> <p>Reading says it is especially common for women to work to maintain ties they find unrewarding and even actively unpleasant, often having been conditioned to keep the peace and prioritise others\u2019 needs above their own. \u201cEffectively, women are raised to believe that you\u2019re either selfish or selfless.\u201d</p> <p>She often sees adult women struggling to protect themselves against their overbearing mothers: a \u201cparticularly painful dynamic\u201d that was probably established in childhood. Emotional vampires might also enter into our lives in the form of co-workers or co-parents, Reading says \u2013 making it harder to&nbsp;create distance.</p> <p>Schoolfriends are another common culprit, as people naturally grow apart over time, but feel reluctant to cut longstanding ties. \u201cJust because there\u2019s a legacy to this friendship, it doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have a right to choose what shape it takes,\u201d says Reading. It\u2019s possible to maintain the relationship and still take steps to protect ourselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Managing our own expectations can help make those difficult relationships more sustainable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She suggests considering how much you can give to this individual and tailoring the interaction to bring out the best in them. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got someone in your social circle that\u2019s really overdramatic, loves chaos and wants to be the centre of attention, maybe don\u2019t go out for coffee with several friends, because it will become that person\u2019s show,\u201d says&nbsp;Reading.</p> <p>Instead, you could go for a walk together, one on one; nature might help to \u201cdiffuse that wall of noise\u201d, she suggests. \u201cOr, even better: go and see a film together \u2026 Think laterally about how you can enjoy time and space together in a way that feels healthy for you.\u201d</p> <p>Managing our own expectations can also help make those difficult relationships more sustainable, says Manly. Accepting that one particular friend is not inclined to give a listening ear can alleviate your disappointment or&nbsp;anguish when they speak only&nbsp;of&nbsp;themselves.</p>    <p>Cutting old friends loose can backfire, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s something really precious about those relationships, because they carry the energy of \u2018I knew you when\u2019 and \u2018You knew me when\u2019&nbsp;\u2026 The minute you part from the relationship, you fracture something in that sense of continuity.\u201d But by recognising the value of those shared experiences and memories, the relationship can become a lot easier to maintain, Manly says \u2013 despite all the ways in which you might have grown apart.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily need to completely cut off the relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cWe simply energetically and emotionally create greater distance. And to tell you the truth, when it comes to the emotional vampire, because they are more egocentric, they may not notice it.\u201d Both experts agree that emotional vampires tend to move on when one energy source cuts off&nbsp;the supply. If this seems callous, consider the costs of maintaining the relationship as it is, says Reading. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s&nbsp;also OK to protect your peace.\u201d</p> <p>It can also pay to be more upfront and give a friend a gentle heads-up about how their behaviour is affecting you. It may be an uncomfortable conversation \u2013 but it can be productive. For Troy, 32, confronting how he and his friend of a decade had drifted apart was helpful in changing their course. They had met at university, during a period of change in their lives, but in the subsequent years Troy\u2019s friend had got hung up on a messy breakup. For many years, Troy says, they were stuck in a pattern of him being her shoulder to cry on. \u201cOur friendship shifted from a place of feeling mutual to a point where our conversations were always about her and her relationship and how it was affecting her,\u201d he says. \u201cThe gravitational pull was always towards the dark things she was going through.\u201d Troy tried to respond with compassion, not only hearing his friend out, but trying different ways to help her move on.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d always leave our conversations feeling really down&nbsp;\u2013 and also that nothing I was doing was helping,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a period where we even had a moratorium on talking about him, because I was not interested in having the same conversation we\u2019d&nbsp;been having for the past five or six years.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, Troy began to withdraw, volunteering less about himself and investing less in the friendship. Matters came to a head when his friend said she felt something had changed between them. They ended up having an argument. \u201cIt was a very hard conversation and things were said that were not easy for either of us to&nbsp;hear,\u201d says Troy. But it also released the tensions that had been&nbsp;building on both sides.</p> <p>\u201cThe fight actually acted as a reset button and we sort of made commitments in terms of how we wanted to be better friends to each other,\u201d he says. When they met again a few weeks later, it felt \u201cmuch more even \u2013 there was a sense that we\u2019d gotten past it\u201d. Being prepared to have those difficult conversations with people who matter to us can be productive, not only for our relationships, but for our sense of who we are within them, Reading says. Particularly in the case of family or close friends: \u201cOne of the functions of those relationships is to smooth off each other\u2019s rough edges.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/09/listen-as-well-as-talk-and-try-not-to-interrupt-how-to-be-a-better-friend\">\u2018Listen as well as talk \u2013 and try not to interrupt\u2019: how to be a better friend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of Reading\u2019s clients recently told an old friend, who had complained about feeling lonely, how she might be inadvertently pushing people away.

      "bodyText": "Ellie used to wonder why she always felt drained after spending time with her friends. Then she noticed that they were constantly complaining about their jobs or their partners without ever taking steps to change. Or else they would select an unsuspecting victim and sink their teeth into them. They didn\u2019t want to hear about Ellie, 35 \u2013 the changes she was making in her life, the new business she had started. And they certainly didn\u2019t want to hear that it was going well, she says. \u201cYou almost felt like you couldn\u2019t fit in with them unless you were moaning about something.\u201d Maybe you have one of these characters in your life: an old school friend, perhaps, who consistently leaves you feeling worse than before you met up with them. In psychological shorthand, they are known as \u201cemotional vampires\u201d, for their ability to suck the pleasure from a social interaction \u2013 and your energy along with it. But what are the signs that you are in one\u2019s clutches, or that you have become one yourself? And how can we best handle such relationships? \u201cThere are some people who have an excessive need for attention and validation,\u201d says Suzy Reading, a psychologist and chartered member of the British Psychological Society. They are often overwhelmingly negative, or display a victim mentality, refusing to believe that anything that happens to them is their fault. \u201cA lot of times, they don\u2019t actually want solutions or advice \u2013 they just want to offload,\u201d says Reading. And while they might be intently focused on themselves, \u201cthere\u2019s not a great deal of self-awareness\u201d. It\u2019s not just their own patterns of behaviour that these individuals are oblivious to: emotional vampires are defined by their inability to empathise, leading them to vent their frustrations without thinking how it might affect or be received by the other person. Carla Manly, a clinical psychologist based in California, says such behaviour reflects a lack of emotional intelligence. \u201cWhen somebody is an empathic human being, even if they have a high need, when they reach out for support, they will be aware of your emotional state first.\u201d They might ask you if now is a good time to talk, or pick up on cues that suggest it isn\u2019t. Emotional vampires pay no such mind, says Manly. \u201cThey are only caring for their own appetite, their own needs.\u201d The key point is that the behaviour is consistent, even chronic, says Manly. There are many reasons a friend might temporarily be more demanding, or less present, such as after a breakup or a period of poor mental health. But in functional friendships, there is an underlying sense of give and take. \u201cWe want somebody to be invested as we are invested; a mutual reciprocity. It\u2019s not always 50-50, but overall there is a sense of balance.\u201d An emotional vampire will resist that equilibrium, betraying a fundamental egocentrism. Any attempts to change the subject can be met with one-upmanship, dismissiveness or even hostility. \u201cIf you do then challenge them on it, they\u2019re so resistant that you might end up getting attacked,\u201d says Reading. But to characterise one person as the predatory bloodsucker and the other as their hapless victim can be reductive. After all, vampires can\u2019t prey on just anyone: you have to invite them in. \u201cIf someone has managed to get into this position of being completely domineering, then obviously we\u2019ve allowed it to some extent, or possibly enabled it,\u201d says Jenny van Hooff, a sociologist at Manchester Metropolitan University. Even with the best of intentions, it can be all too easy to get sucked into the dynamic. Beth, 38, befriended a friend of a friend, wishing to support her through her first pregnancy. The younger woman struggled with her family and was not in contact with the father of her child and Beth thought she could help. But every time they spoke, Beth felt depleted, depressed and helpless. \u201cI started to realise that I\u2019d repeat the same things over and over again and she would never follow the suggestions, nor listen to me.\u201d When the woman started volunteering information about her childhood traumas, Beth felt that a line had been crossed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the trauma per se, but the fact that she would \u2018vomit\u2019 information without really listening,\u201d she says. \u201cThe next time she called, I told her I only had 15 minutes, and the time after that, I made up an excuse so that we wouldn\u2019t speak.\u201d Reading says it is especially common for women to work to maintain ties they find unrewarding and even actively unpleasant, often having been conditioned to keep the peace and prioritise others\u2019 needs above their own. \u201cEffectively, women are raised to believe that you\u2019re either selfish or selfless.\u201d She often sees adult women struggling to protect themselves against their overbearing mothers: a \u201cparticularly painful dynamic\u201d that was probably established in childhood.

      "body": "<p>The news hasn\u2019t been good for people planning to live for ever. First came Dr Saul Newman\u2019s investigative work into supercententarians \u2013 those aged 110 or older. In a paper titled <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080v3.full.pdf+html\">\u201cSupercentenarian and remarkable age records exhibit patterns indicative of clerical errors and pension fraud\u201d</a>, Newman reported that high concentrations of supposedly extremely old people occurred, implausibly, in places with the highest rates of poverty&nbsp;\u2013 a&nbsp;predictor of the worst health \u2013 and with no birth certificates. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, the number of supercentenarians declined by between 69% and 82%, depending on the state, when birth certificates were introduced.</p> <p>Guttingly for anyone who spends a fortune on jasmine tea and natt\u014d by following the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/okinawa-diet#foods-to-eat\">Okinawa diet</a>, Newman\u2019s research also challenged the notion of \u201cblue zones\u201d, pointing to high error and fraud rates in those mythic, much-admired areas with high concentrations of centenarians. In 2010, more than 230,000 Japanese centenarians turned out to be missing, imaginary, clerical errors or dead; in Greece, 72% of census-reported centenarians in 2012 were discovered to be dead (\u201cor, depending on your perspective, committing pension fraud\u201d).

      "bodyText": "The news hasn\u2019t been good for people planning to live for ever. First came Dr Saul Newman\u2019s investigative work into supercententarians \u2013 those aged 110 or older. In a paper titled \u201cSupercentenarian and remarkable age records exhibit patterns indicative of clerical errors and pension fraud\u201d, Newman reported that high concentrations of supposedly extremely old people occurred, implausibly, in places with the highest rates of poverty \u2013 a predictor of the worst health \u2013 and with no birth certificates. In the US, the number of supercentenarians declined by between 69% and 82%, depending on the state, when birth certificates were introduced. Guttingly for anyone who spends a fortune on jasmine tea and natt\u014d by following the Okinawa diet, Newman\u2019s research also challenged the notion of \u201cblue zones\u201d, pointing to high error and fraud rates in those mythic, much-admired areas with high concentrations of centenarians. In 2010, more than 230,000 Japanese centenarians turned out to be missing, imaginary, clerical errors or dead; in Greece, 72% of census-reported centenarians in 2012 were discovered to be dead (\u201cor, depending on your perspective, committing pension fraud\u201d). Dump the daikon! Banish Greek beans! (Not really: they are still good for you, just not \u201clive to 120\u201d good.) But we will still live longer than our grandparents, won\u2019t we? About that: we may be reaching peak longevity. New research analysing international demographic data suggests the \u201climited lifespan hypothesis\u201d (which posits that we are nearing the upper limit of human lifespan) may be correct. There is, apparently, \u201cno evidence to support the suggestion that most newborns today will live to age 100\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re suggesting that as long as we live now is about as long as we\u2019re going to live,\u201d the study lead, S Jay Olshansky, told the New York Times. On first blush, that seems disappointing, especially the super-old probably not being as old as previously thought, or indeed alive. I always enjoy reading about their boozing, chocolate-scoffing and smoking antics. It must be especially unwelcome for Silicon Valley\u2019s loopy longevity community. \u201cProfessional rejuvenation athlete\u201d Bryan Johnson would be livid if he weren\u2019t far too busy masticating his compost heap of a breakfast while wearing an infrared hat to notice (I watched a video of his morning routine recently and instantly lost my own will to live). But could these longevity bombshells actually be good news, and not just because I feel a spiteful satisfaction imagining that the self-absorbed biohacking billionaires are on a hi-tech hiding to nothing? Accepting that no hack will make us immortal may help us focus on how to make our finite lives better, by tackling our real problems.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019ll do from me. Well done to England, especially Maia Bouchier who is a wonderful talent. I hope she gets a continued run throughout the tournament. England are peaking at just the right time. Can they find that extra gear to topple Australia? We\u2019ll find out together. Til then\u2026 Here\u2019s a look at the Group B table: That all happened so fast that I missed this email from Jeremy Boyce. With apologies to Jeremy, here it is in full: I\u2019m guessing England will be disappointed to lose the toss and would have batted first had they won it, in the hope of blasting their run-rate in an upwardly direction. In the twists and turns of all that, could we imagine England bowling \u201csoft\u201d to give themselves a bigger total to chase down Baz-ball style ? All the same, if they bowl Scotland out cheaply they could still try and blast a victory. More to the point, if Lauren Bell ends up bowling to Olivia Bell (or vice versa) will you be describing it as a ding-dong encounter ? (I\u2019ll get my coat) England now sit top of Group B and have the best net run-rate of the lot. With three wins from thee games, they have six points, level with South Africa but with a game to spare and a NRR of 1.72 compared to 1.38 from the Proteas. The West Indies are in third on four points and have to play England in the final group game. Finally, Heather Knight: Really pleased. The pitch got a lot better. I thought we let them get a bit too many but actually we didn\u2019t. We bowled really well. Bouchier has stepped up. Hitting her first three balls for four. It was just about getting there as fast as we could. Credit to them. We want to keep winning and keep momentum going. Scotland\u2019s skipper Kathryn Bryce is up next. Honestly, what can one say after such a shellacking? Let\u2019s find out: It\u2019s been a tough tournament for us but such a massive honour to be here and lead the team out. There are only learnings that can taken moving forward. It\u2019s the basics and doing them over and over. It\u2019s always challenging when you play in a different stadium against a different team. The girls are getting used to that. It\u2019s been incredible. Loads of parents out here cheering no matter what\u2019s going on. [On Lorna Jack-Brown, who retires today] She\u2019s been playing cricket for Scotland for 18 years. We\u2019ll have a meal and celebrate the career she\u2019s had. No surprise that Maia Bouchier is the player of the match. Here\u2019s what she has to say: I felt really good. It\u2019s always easy batting with Danni. We stick to our strengths and run really well. We got told about the 8th over about net run-rate and that we wanted to get it done by the 10th over. The bowlers did really well to keep them down. Of course we want to take that trophy. We\u2019 don\u2019t want to think about other teams. We\u2019re putting ourselves in a really good position. It was really important for me to try and be still. I kept telling myself to be still and Danni kept reminding me. I back myself to go out and win us games. That was emphatic! And what an eventful over to close it out. Bouchier raised her 50 having nailed a reverse sweep over point from Kathryn Bryce earlier in the over. Then there was a big appeal for lbw before over-throws added three to Wyatt-Hodge\u2019s tally. That brought the scores level and Bouchier put the finishing touches with a blistering sweep behind square that screamed to the boundary. A perfect display with the bat. Will be hard to drop Bouchier after that. 10th over: England 113-0 (Bouchier 62, Wyatt-Hodge 51) 9th over: England 100-0 (Bouchier 53, Wyatt-Hodge 47) Incredible scenes. Brilliant batting from Wyatt-Hodge who lifts a wonderful cover drive over a packed infield for four. Good running elsewhere adds five more to the total. Just 10 needed for victory. 8th over: England 89-0 (Bouchier 50, Wyatt-Hodge 37) Bouchier raises her fifty of 30 balls with a shuffle across her stumps and swish over fine leg for four. 10 fours in her knock, including one at the top of this Fraser over that was punished through cover. She\u2019s been helped by some poor bowling. Scotland have varied between being too short and wide and too straight and full. Batters of this quality don\u2019t often miss out. This is doing wonders for England\u2019s NRR. 7th over: England 77-0 (Bouchier 41, Wyatt-Hidge 36) Scotland go to their leg-spinner, Maqsood, but she can;t stem the flow of runs. 11 off this over with a full toss scooped for four over the \u2018keeper\u2019s head by Wyatt-Hodge. There are three twos in the set as well as Maqsood struggles to find a regular line or length. 6th over: England 66-0 (Bouchier 40, Wyatt-Hodge 26) Another monstrous over to close out the powerplay. Kahtryn Bryce starts it with a short ball and Bouchier thrashes it with a sweetly timed cut for four. Wyatt-Hodge responds with a dazzling cut of her own and then follows that up with another boundary, this one in front of square. It\u2019s just too short and wide from Scotland. 5th over: England 51-0 (Bouchier 34, Wyatt-Hodge 17) It\u2019s raining boundaries! Slater comes back into the attack and Bouchier welcomes her with a spank that flies between cover and point. Too wide again from Slater. Bouchier collects two with a glance and then back-to-back fours. First a drive through the off side and then a heave over mid-on to bring up the fastest 50-run partnership of the tournament. 4th over: England 36-0 (Bouchier 19, Wyatt-Hodge 14) The English are in a hurry. In truth, Bell has served up some dross and that over got rightly spanked for 18 with four fours peppered throughout. Her first ball was a full toss and got slugged over square leg by Wyatt-Hodge. The next ball was biffed down the ground for four more. A single brought Bouchier on strike and she nailed a cover drive after a dance down the track. Wyatt-Hodge then closed out the set with a thrash through point from a drag down. 3rd over: England 18-0 (Bouchier 14, Wyatt-Hodge 4) Slater\u2019s been pulled from the attack and Kathryn Bryce comes into the equation. Her medium pacers are wicket to wicket and the English openers are content to work the singles. Four of them in fact. They look really comfortable out there. 2nd over: England 15-0 (Bouchier 13, Wyatt-Hodge 2) Bell\u2019s spin opens the other end and she drops a sitter! I know they\u2019re apparently \u2018never easy\u2019 but this is as simple as a return catch can be. Wyatt-Hodge spooned it back as if she was tossing it underarm and somehow Bell grassed it. Three singles means it\u2019s a decent start for the Scottish spinner, but she really should have a wicket to her name. 1st over: England 12-0 (Bouchier 12, Wyatt-Hodge 0) England\u2019s chase explodes out the blocks with a hat-trick of boundaries from Bouchier\u2019s bat. First she helps on a bit of dross down the leg side before lashing a cut shot between point and cover. She saved her best for last as a textbook-perfect cover drive threads the needle in the off side. Slater recovered to land three consecutive dot balls, but that\u2019s the first round conclusively going the way of the English. England will fancy that. The final over, delivered by Bell, is a miserly one. She\u2019s wicket to wicket and concedes six runs. There\u2019s a chance for a return catch but it was one of those that had to stick. Lovely slower balls across a decent second spell sees Bell end with 1-16 from her four. I doubt that\u2019ll be enough. England will perhaps target an early finish to boost their net run-rate. 19th over: Scotland 103-6 (McColl 7, Fraser 3) Sciver-Brunt has bowled Fraser but the bails stayed on! And it wasn\u2019t a clip. That properly made contact with leg stump! What\u2019s worse is that it then trickled away for four byes. Jones won\u2019t like that. Fraser then uses her luck to pop Sciver-Brunt for two over her head. Three singles elsewhere. Ecclestone closes out with a wicket to finish with 2-13 from four overs. What. A. Player! She\u2019s just so good, isn\u2019t she. It\u2019s the extra bounce that did it again as Carter gets low to play the slog sweep. But the lift off the deck sees it catch the top edge and it sails tamely to Bouchier who catches without fuss in the deep. Five runs \u2013 all run \u2013 off the over. That\u2019s another fantastic day out for the world\u2019s premier bowler. 18th over: Scotland 94-6 (McColl 5) That\u2019s the big one! Having just hit Dean down the ground for four, Bryce brings out the reverse sweep but gets in a tangle. Dean pushed it straighter and fuller and beat the swishing blade to find leg stump. There goes Scotland\u2019s best hope of reaching a defendable target. 17th over: Scotland 89-5 (McColl 3) 16th over: Scotland 82-4 (K Bryce 28, McColl 1) Bell bags a wicket but also drags down a hit-me ball that Bryce rightly spanks with a scything cut shot. So the over is worth six but England won\u2019t mind as long as they keep chipping away. Jack-Brown registers a duck in her final T20 game for her country! Oh cricket can be cruel. Still, it was a poor stroke. She wasn\u2019t forward or back, stuck in her crease and in the end the full delivery snuck under the bat and knocked back her off stump. 15th over: Scotland 76-3 (K Bryce 23, Jack-Brown 0) Gibson\u2019s first over in the World Cup started poorly with a long-hop that Bryce pulled for four. But she adjusted her line and bowled with more zip into the surface and Lister couldn\u2019t generate enough power when she attempted to go over the top. A wicket and five runs off it, not a bad opening return. The bowling change works! Gibson, into the attack, started with a long-hop that was spanked for four. But this one splices off the swinging bat of Lister and balloons into the covers. There\u2019s the threat of a collision but Knight eventually takes charge and grabs hold as she tumbles to the ground. 14th over: Scotland 71-2 (Bryce 18, Lister 11) Another good over from Scotland, this time from the seam of Sciver-Brunt. They\u2019re building momentum with a 21-run partnership. Bryce pulls out a cute scoop that\u2019s worth two. Four singles off the bat and a leg-bye to start has things ticking along. 13th over: Scotland 64-2 (K Bryce 14, Lister 9) Scotland have their first six of the tournament as Lister smokes Glenn over the leg side boundary with a mighty slog sweep. Cleared the front leg and got a full swing of the bat, that was meaty! Three singles and a two to start the over add up to Scotland\u2019s most productive set so far worth 11. There was also a bizarre run-out chance as Bryce got her bat stuck in the pitch as she was sliding it home. That meant she had to reach out with her hand to reach safety. A better placed throw from Bell in the outfield would have made things interesting. 12th over: Scotland 53-2 (K Bryce 10, Lister 2) Bell returns and Jones remains standing up to the stumps. Better from the lanky seamer who finds a regular line outside off stump. She starts with three dots and then the Scots work a pair of singles. Lister crouches to the final ball and makes an audacious attempt at a scoop, but she can\u2019t make contact. Great work once again from Jones with the gloves. She really is a cut above. 11th over: Scotland 51-2 (K Bryce 9, Lister 1) Success for Ecclestone who had kept the Scots to just a single from her first three balls. That perhaps compelled S Bryce to force the issue. New batter Lister gets off the mark with a skip down the pitch and a single past extra cover. Outstanding from Jones! That\u2019s the world\u2019s best wicketkeeper combining with the world\u2019s best bowler. Brilliance all round. Bryce was completely beaten in the air as the ball dropped on her as she charged towards it. Enough turn beat the bat and Jones had the bails off in a flash. That was no easy take behind the stumps as she had to ride the bounce and then get her hands towards the sticks. Great work. Umpire\u2019s review pending. Ecclestone might have Sarah Bryce stumped here\u2026. 10th over: Scotland 49-1 (S Bryce 27, K Bryce 8) Half-way there and England will certainly be the happier of the two sides. Dean fizzes down another over of spin in next to no time and gives up just three singles. Kathryn twice shimmied across her stumps to swipe a single into the leg side, but there\u2019s not enough power and it\u2019s not placed into a gap to find the boundary. 9th over: Scotland 46-1 (S Bryce 26, K Bryce 6) The Bryce sisters are together at the crease. New batter Katherine is off the mark with a lofted cover drive that is a thing of beauty. She picks up two singles elsewhere, with Sarah registering three of her own, so that Glenn over is worth nine. Simple as! Sciver-Brunt, bowling into the pitch, gets one to hold just a fraction. It means that Horley is through with her shot far too early and the attempted lofted drive down the ground spoons tamely to mid-off where Ecclestone pouches it. England are on the board. 8th over: Scotland 38-1 (S Bryce 24) 7th over: Scotland 34-0 (Horley 10, S Bryce 23) Another over whizzes by. Glenn into the attack and she\u2019s through her work in a flash. her skiddy leg-breaks are straight and testing, but the Scots handle her well, collecting five comfortable singles. 6th over: Scotland 29-0 (Horley 7, S Bryce 21) Well Scotland aren\u2019t exactly exploding over the horizon, but they\u2019re unblemished after the powerplay. A direct hit from Dean\u2019s throw at the non-striker\u2019s end would have changed that. Instead Bryce\u2019s dive saw her home for a quick single. Three more singles from Ecclestone\u2019s over means it\u2019s a handy start for the underdogs, but they\u2019ll want to kick on now. 5th over: Scotland 25-0 (Horley 5, S Bryce 19) Sarah Bryce is in the groove now. She unfurled a gorgeous cover drive for four after charging to the pitch of a slower tossed-up ball from Dean. That was the shot of the game by a mile. From there it was all about manipulating the field; three singles and a couple for Bryce off her hips. 4th over: Scotland 16-0 (Horley 4, S Bryce 11) They\u2019re motoring through their overs. Helps when you\u2019ve got spin at both ends, which is what they have now with Sophie Ecclestone into the attack. As you\u2019d expect from the world\u2019s number one bowler in this format she\u2019s on the money from the very first. Zippy through the air, she gives up two singles, one a scampered single to Dean at mid-off who was caught day dreaming a touch. 3rd over: Scotland 14-0 (Horley 3, S Bryce 10) Another over ends with a flashing blade, an outside edge and a boundary for Bryce. Charlie Dean\u2019s first over is tidy \u2013 conceding two singles and a tight wide down leg \u2013 \u2013 until she dangles a teaser wide outside off stump. Bryce throws her hands at it and gets enough wood on it to see it fly down to deep third for four. 2nd over: Scotland 7-0 (Horley 2, S Bryce 5) Lauren Bell\u2019s first over in the tournament is a little all over the place. She\u2019s lucky not to concede a wide with her first ball down leg as it clipped a pad. Just two runs off the bat means it\u2019s not a bad return, but she\u2019ll want to find her radar and target the off-stump more in her next set. 1st over: Scotland 5-0 (Horley 1, Bryce 4) The final ball is edged for four, but it was a loose delivery from Sciver-Brunt that was wide outside off stump. Otherwise she was tidy, conceding just a single to Horley who steered one off her back foot behind point. It\u2019s Sciver-Brunt with the new ball. Nasser has just shared an interesting stat. Scotland have not hit a six all tournament. England have managed just one themselves so far. Anthems now. Flower of Scotland up first, which is such a banger! Dunkley gets an opportunity with Capsey sidelined with illness. Bell\u2019s seam replaces Smith\u2019s spin. McColl comes into the picture with Chatterji missing out. No Alice Capsey, you might have noticed. That\u2019s not the only change for England but it is the only enforced switch. Capsey has been struck low by an illness that has afflicted several English players. Could that impact their performance? England: Maia Bouchier, Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Sophia Dunkley, Nat Sciver-Brunt, Heather Knight (c), Amy Jones (wk), Danielle Gibson, Sophie Ecclestone, Charlie Dean, Sarah Glenn, Lauren Bell. Scotland: Saskia Horley, Sarah Bryce (wk), Kathryn Bryce (c), Alisa Lister, Megan McColl, Darcey Carter, Lorna Jack-Brown, Katherine Fraser, Rachel Slater, Abtaha Maqsood, Olivia Bell. \u201cLet\u2019s put a bit of pressure on them and enjoy our last game.\u201d So says the Scottish skipper Kathryn Bryce. Not exactly rooted in hard number crunching, but it\u2019s as good a reason as any to kick off with the willow. Heather Knight would have batted first as well. She cites the wear and tear on the pitch that\u2019s already been used twice. Could be good for England to chase again. Some Sunday morning reading: Barney Ronay on England\u2019s male maestros: Simon Burnton on the team\u2019s wow factor: James Wallace on one the group\u2019s less celebrated figures: Australia all but cemented their place in the last four, but their victory might be filed under P for \u2018Pyrrhic\u2019. Their skipper, Alyssa Healy, limped off as she was steering her team to a comfortably run chase against Pakistan. Healy could return to full match sharpness but the same is sadly not true for bowler Tayla Vlaemink who dislocated her shoulder while fielding. England have their target in sight. A win today would effectively see them qualify for the semi-finals. But that\u2019s not enough. Arguably the more important objective is to top the group and therefore avoid Australia in the first knock-out game. A win today over Scotland would bring them closer to their goal. They were excellent against South Africa five days ago, timing their run-chase to perfection. There were splutters against Bangladesh, particularly with the bat, but their impressive battery of spinners secured a comfortable victory. Of all the teams still in the fight for a semi-final berth from Group B \u2013 along with South Africa and the West Indies \u2013 England have the lowest run-rate. A better show with the willow today. Toss and teams to come. Play to start at 11am BST.",

      "body": "<p>Three years ago, he was Scotland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.whatscotlandthinks.org/2021/03/is-salmonds-unpopularity-definitely-a-barrier-to-albas-chances-of-success/\">most unpopular</a> politician. More unpopular even than Boris Johnson. And north of the border, that\u2019s really saying something.</p> <p>Three months ago, his Alba party lost both MPs in the UK general election \u2013 unsurprising since they were first elected under a Scottish National party flag, but marking the end of Alba\u2019s brief presence at Westminster. The party also <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/24432761.general-election-results-alba-candidates-lose-deposits/\">lost its deposit</a> in every one of the 19 seats it contested.</p> <p>Yet despite this, the party\u2019s leader, Alex Salmond, remained optimistic. In truth, he had no other setting. An <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/24393127.alba-course-win-seats-scotland-holyrood-election---poll/\">opinion poll</a> in June for the Holyrood elections had given his party 5% of the vote \u2013 a pitiful showing compared with those heady days as SNP leader. But enough, in Scotland\u2019s proportional voting system, to elect three Alba MSPs in the 2026 Scottish parliament elections. And one was bound to be Alex Salmond.</p> <p>No longer. His unexpected death in North Macedonia this weekend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/12/incomparable-alex-salmond-made-scottish-nationalism-soar-before-he-and-snp-soured\">has created shock waves</a> in Scotland, out of all proportion to Alba\u2019s popularity or Salmond\u2019s current clout.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/13/alex-salmond-had-huge-political-impact-says-john-swinney-scotland\">Tributes paid to Alex Salmond\u2019s \u2018colossal contribution\u2019 to Scottish and UK politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was a man so habitually described as Marmite, so often labelled divisive, so nearly written off after a court case for sexual assault (in which he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/alex-salmond-acquitted-of-all-charges-in-sexual-assault-trial\">acquitted</a>), and so determined to have his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-67517416\">day in court</a> against the party and government he once led for its handling of the complaints against him \u2013 how can such a man\u2019s death stir an entire nation?</p> <p>Mostly because his actions and personality changed the course of Scottish political life \u2013 leading the SNP to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/06/snp-election-victory-scottish-independence\">2011 landslide victory in Holyrood elections</a> designed to make majority government next to impossible. The scale of that win prompted David Cameron to concede the independence referendum three years later. The rest, as they say, is history.</p> <p>But that pivotal moment in 2011 was carefully built over long decades \u2013 not snatched. When Salmond first became leader in 1990, the SNP were portrayed as \u201ctartan Tories\u201d \u2013 suspicious of the EU, wary of devolution and standing huffily outside the process that would eventually create the Scottish parliament. Salmond changed all that, made the SNP a credible opposition to Labour at Holyrood but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jul/18/scotland.devolution\">stood down</a> as leader in 2000 to \u201cpass the baton\u201d on to a new generation. SNP support was at a healthy 30%. He was just 45.</p>    <p>Yet the man who lived for politics couldn\u2019t stay away. He clinched the party leadership again in 2004 on a joint ticket with Nicola Sturgeon as his deputy and won the 2007 Scottish elections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/04/scotland.devolution\">by a single seat</a>. Amid predictions his minority government wouldn\u2019t last a month, Salmond thrived. He had the sign on the civil service HQ <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6974798.stm\">changed from Scottish Executive</a> to Scottish Government overnight. He abolished bridge tolls, did away with <a href=\"https://theferret.scot/sturgeon-snp-scrapped-tuition-fees/\">university tuition fees</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12928485\">scrapped prescription charges</a>, arguing that means testing cost almost the same as free, universal provision.</p> <p>Energy is reserved to Westminster, but Salmond used devolved planning powers to veto new nuclear plants and approve a big expansion of onshore wind \u2013 in effect banned for almost a decade in England by the Tories. In January 2024, <a href=\"https://www.scottishrenewables.com/news/1495-more-than-100-of-scotlands-electricity-demand-produced-by-renewables-for-the-first-time\">more than 100% of Scottish electricity demand</a> was met by renewable energy for the first time. An impressive domestic legacy \u2013 overshadowed by the campaign that took independence <a href=\"https://www.research.aqmen.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2017/07/PostGE2015Scotland_Referendum-Impact.pdf\">from 37% support a year before the IndyRef</a> to 45% on the day. Many academics suggest Salmond lost the vote in 2014 but <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-923X.13306\">won the argument with younger voters</a>.</p> <p>None of that would have happened without confidence, vision and personality.</p> <p>When I think of Alex Salmond, a kaleidoscope of moments come to mind. A friend told me his independence-supporting dad was keen to meet the new first minister, who was on a trip to their remote island home. But after a stroke, the older man found he couldn\u2019t stand. Salmond sat down on the kitchen floor beside his chair and chatted for half an hour, holding his hand. Personal stories like this are legion.</p> <p>Alex Salmond enjoyed craic, conversation and meeting people. He took time with them. He enjoyed horse racing and betting, golf, pints and curries \u2013 perhaps too much. And he relished a good argument.</p> <p>In 2008 I visited the newish first minister at Holyrood and asked if he regretted describing Iceland, Ireland and Norway as the arc of prosperity since two were almost bankrupt after the financial crash. We had an animated discussion.</p> <p>At the end of our time, Salmond asked if I could wait while he met an ambassador \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll be straight back.\u201d And so he was. This happened four times, with an interrupted but fascinating, quick-witted discussion about the real underpinnings of success for the Nordic countries and the different path Salmond was planning for Scotland. I didn\u2019t pull my punches \u2013 he didn\u2019t pull his. And three hours later I left, impressed by his cheek, curiosity and willingness to listen.</p> <p>Alex Salmond may be remembered most by commentators for his epic schism with the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon. But if there\u2019s a funeral or memorial service in Edinburgh, I predict the streets will be thronged in tribute to an eternal optimist, a politician who chose Edinburgh over London and the man who put independence firmly and for ever on the map.</p> <p>But also, that rarest of things \u2013 a politician who loved life.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lesley Riddoch is a writer, journalist, campaigner and podcaster</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "Three years ago, he was Scotland\u2019s most unpopular politician. More unpopular even than Boris Johnson. And north of the border, that\u2019s really saying something. Three months ago, his Alba party lost both MPs in the UK general election \u2013 unsurprising since they were first elected under a Scottish National party flag, but marking the end of Alba\u2019s brief presence at Westminster. The party also lost its deposit in every one of the 19 seats it contested. Yet despite this, the party\u2019s leader, Alex Salmond, remained optimistic. In truth, he had no other setting. An opinion poll in June for the Holyrood elections had given his party 5% of the vote \u2013 a pitiful showing compared with those heady days as SNP leader. But enough, in Scotland\u2019s proportional voting system, to elect three Alba MSPs in the 2026 Scottish parliament elections. And one was bound to be Alex Salmond. No longer. His unexpected death in North Macedonia this weekend has created shock waves in Scotland, out of all proportion to Alba\u2019s popularity or Salmond\u2019s current clout. He was a man so habitually described as Marmite, so often labelled divisive, so nearly written off after a court case for sexual assault (in which he was acquitted), and so determined to have his day in court against the party and government he once led for its handling of the complaints against him \u2013 how can such a man\u2019s death stir an entire nation? Mostly because his actions and personality changed the course of Scottish political life \u2013 leading the SNP to a 2011 landslide victory in Holyrood elections designed to make majority government next to impossible. The scale of that win prompted David Cameron to concede the independence referendum three years later. The rest, as they say, is history. But that pivotal moment in 2011 was carefully built over long decades \u2013 not snatched. When Salmond first became leader in 1990, the SNP were portrayed as \u201ctartan Tories\u201d \u2013 suspicious of the EU, wary of devolution and standing huffily outside the process that would eventually create the Scottish parliament. Salmond changed all that, made the SNP a credible opposition to Labour at Holyrood but stood down as leader in 2000 to \u201cpass the baton\u201d on to a new generation. SNP support was at a healthy 30%. He was just 45. Yet the man who lived for politics couldn\u2019t stay away. He clinched the party leadership again in 2004 on a joint ticket with Nicola Sturgeon as his deputy and won the 2007 Scottish elections by a single seat. Amid predictions his minority government wouldn\u2019t last a month, Salmond thrived. He had the sign on the civil service HQ changed from Scottish Executive to Scottish Government overnight. He abolished bridge tolls, did away with university tuition fees and scrapped prescription charges, arguing that means testing cost almost the same as free, universal provision. Energy is reserved to Westminster, but Salmond used devolved planning powers to veto new nuclear plants and approve a big expansion of onshore wind \u2013 in effect banned for almost a decade in England by the Tories. In January 2024, more than 100% of Scottish electricity demand was met by renewable energy for the first time. An impressive domestic legacy \u2013 overshadowed by the campaign that took independence from 37% support a year before the IndyRef to 45% on the day. Many academics suggest Salmond lost the vote in 2014 but won the argument with younger voters. None of that would have happened without confidence, vision and personality. When I think of Alex Salmond, a kaleidoscope of moments come to mind. A friend told me his independence-supporting dad was keen to meet the new first minister, who was on a trip to their remote island home. But after a stroke, the older man found he couldn\u2019t stand. Salmond sat down on the kitchen floor beside his chair and chatted for half an hour, holding his hand. Personal stories like this are legion. Alex Salmond enjoyed craic, conversation and meeting people. He took time with them. He enjoyed horse racing and betting, golf, pints and curries \u2013 perhaps too much. And he relished a good argument. In 2008 I visited the newish first minister at Holyrood and asked if he regretted describing Iceland, Ireland and Norway as the arc of prosperity since two were almost bankrupt after the financial crash. We had an animated discussion. At the end of our time, Salmond asked if I could wait while he met an ambassador \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll be straight back.\u201d And so he was. This happened four times, with an interrupted but fascinating, quick-witted discussion about the real underpinnings of success for the Nordic countries and the different path Salmond was planning for Scotland. I didn\u2019t pull my punches \u2013 he didn\u2019t pull his. And three hours later I left, impressed by his cheek, curiosity and willingness to listen. Alex Salmond may be remembered most by commentators for his epic schism with the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon. But if there\u2019s a funeral or memorial service in Edinburgh, I predict the streets will be thronged in tribute to an eternal optimist, a politician who chose Edinburgh over London and the man who put independence firmly and for ever on the map. But also, that rarest of things \u2013 a politician who loved life. Lesley Riddoch is a writer, journalist, campaigner and podcaster Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Within 20 minutes of a moving, amusing and life-affirming morning in his company, the softly spoken Scot begins to repeat himself.</p> <p>Despite all this, Alexander considers himself to be \u201clucky\u201d because he has a diagnosis, bringing clarity after years of confusion, bewilderment and fear. A chance email from the Bristol Rovers Former Players Association in January led to Alexander undergoing scans. His wife, Janet, is hoping a dementia diagnosis will follow on the NHS, opening access to medication for the chronic headaches and tremors which often leave him unable to sleep. His treatment is limited to paracetamol.</p> <p>Since being diagnosed with CTE, Alexander has joined a group of about 60 former footballers taking legal action against the Football Association over brain injuries sustained during their careers, with the families of the late Nobby Stiles and Joe Kinnear also part of the claim being heard in the high court.

I just want to get the word out. About six months ago I was with four or five ex-players in the pub. I was telling them about my problems and they said: \u2018That\u2019s strange, it\u2019s happening to me as well.\u2019 There must be so many of them.

It reached a point where I couldn\u2019t go on.</p> <p>\u201cI went to see doctors in Glasgow a couple of years ago and told them I didn\u2019t feel right \u2013 I was depressed, had anxiety. They just said it was old age.

His medical notes show he sustained at least four serious concussions in his career, including one shocking incident in an FA Cup first-round game against Fisher Athletic in 1988, when he swallowed his tongue.</p> <p>\u201cI nearly died on the pitch once,\u201d he says. \u201cRight from the kick-off the ball was played up to me, and a centre-half came out of nowhere and smashed me. There was a clash of heads and the next thing I remember is being in hospital. I\u2019d swallowed my tongue and half my denture plate. They told me I was about 20 or 30 seconds away from death.</p> <p>\u201cThat happened on a Saturday and I was training again by Wednesday. I was supposed to play the next Saturday, but Gerry said he\u2019d give me another week off so it was a fortnight before I came back. I didn\u2019t think about the risks. It was my job, wasn\u2019t it? You took the knocks, got on with it, and went again. Now it\u2019s all coming to light.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander reveals that Rovers did not have a doctor at the Fisher game. \u201cThe referee shouldn\u2019t have started the game because the doctor wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he says. \u201cThe club doctor was stuck in traffic and I didn\u2019t see him until I was in the hospital. We never saw the doctor really; it was just physios.</p> <p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the club physio Roy Dolling, I would definitely have died. I swallowed my tongue, my denture plate snapped and half of it went down my throat. He used to carry a piece of metal in his kitbag. He flipped it down and pulled my teeth out.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander reflects with fondness on his life in football, albeit tinged with sadness at what it might have cost him. \u201cI had a good life, but looking back, I think I could have a better life now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m paying the price now. I played 299 games for Bristol Rovers \u2013 I wasn\u2019t good enough to make 300!</p> <p>\u201cWe won the [Third Division] league in 1990. Bristol City were second, so it was quite a year.

Made some good friends.</p> <p>\u201cThe doctors gave me two to six years, but they say I\u2019m quite fit. I\u2019m not going to give in. I\u2019m going to fight it till the end.

      "body": "<p>Has anyone ever told you to \u201cstop worrying\u201d or that \u201cit will all work out in the end\u201d? It doesn\u2019t really help, does it? After more than 10 years of working with clients as a psychotherapist, I am so aware of the headspace that worry and anxiety consumes. I know how uncertainty can taint otherwise wonderful experiences, catch us restless in the dark while those around us sleep, and find us living much of life from a braced position.</p> <p>As a child, I was full of worry, having lived through one of my own worst-case scenarios: losing a sibling. No matter how many times someone told me not to worry, it never silenced the thoughts and fears in my mind. How can someone reassure me that the worst probably won\u2019t happen when, in one way, it already has? We reassure each other that \u201cit\u2019s fine, nobody is judging you\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m sure that medical test will come back clear\u201d, yet these well-meaning words don\u2019t tend to offer much of the reassurance we crave, because we know full well that bad things <em>do</em> happen, we <em>do</em> get judged by others and there\u2019s always a chance the test will come back positive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Failing at something doesn\u2019t mean you are a\u00a0failure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ploughing endless energy into trying to control the uncontrollable is keeping us all tired and troubled. The fact is that ignoring fears doesn\u2019t make them less true, it makes them more powerful. After years of struggling with my own anxiety, I decided to try a different tack \u2013 and it changed my world.</p> <p>Instead of doing everything I could to ease and avoid life\u2019s uncomfortable truths, I sought a deeper acceptance of them. Through using this approach, I discovered that anxiety finally began to loosen its grip. In researching my book I discovered 10 uncomfortable realities that many of us are afraid to face \u2013 ways you can thrive amid these uncertainties and embrace more of life\u2019s joy, despite full awareness of what\u2019s at stake.</p> <p><strong>1. Some people don\u2019t like me. </strong>Ask yourself this. If planning a holiday, would you trust an opinion given by someone who had never set foot in the country? Of course you wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019d seek advice from someone who had visited, stayed in a great location, eaten around the town. Remember this next time you find yourself ruminating over someone\u2019s judgment of you. If they don\u2019t truly know you, does their assessment deserve to take up so much bandwidth in your mind?</p> <p><strong>2. I am going to fail. </strong>If you are someone who fears failing at things, or you find your inner critic goes haywire when something didn\u2019t go as you\u2019d hoped, ask yourself whether your expectations were realistic. Remember, failing at something doesn\u2019t mean you are a failure, it just means that something didn\u2019t work out as you\u2019d hoped, either because your expectations were sky-high, something happened outside your control, or because you\u2019re a human who makes mistakes sometimes.</p> <p><strong>3. Life isn\u2019t fair. </strong>We can expend so much energy shaking our fist at life\u2019s curveballs and feeling the injustice of situations we see happening to or around us. It\u2019s important to seek fairness despite the fact that life isn\u2019t inherently fair. Bad things happen to good people, people hurt one another. But feeling like a victim of life\u2019s unfairness can keep us stuck and unmotivated. As we accept that life isn\u2019t fair, and stop shaking our fists, we free up energy to take a small (or large) step in doing something about it.</p> <p><strong>4. I will hurt people I love. </strong>Oh, the things we\u2019ve swallowed down and the truths we haven\u2019t told out of fear of hurting people. The thing is that, in avoiding honest (albeit sometimes difficult) conversations, we aren\u2019t protecting our treasured relationships as much as we like to think \u2013 we\u2019re welcoming an elephant into the room. It is your responsibility to be authentic and to do it as kindly as you can, but you cannot control how someone chooses to respond to that honesty. A good relationship can withstand healthy boundaries and tricky conversations.</p> <p><strong>5. I can\u2019t always be fully present. </strong>We are encouraged to be more mindful in our daily lives, but this can add pressure. Our minds are created to hop between awareness of the past, present and future. Instead of feeling guilty for not being \u201cpresent enough\u201d, here\u2019s a piece of advice. Every now and again, pause, look around and let your eyes rest on something beautiful, intriguing or interesting. Inhale and acknowledge what is going on in and around you. Now, as you reflect on your day, which may have passed in a busy blur, these are the moments that stay with you.</p> <p><strong>6. People misunderstand me. </strong>It can feel painful when, despite trying to articulate yourself, someone doesn\u2019t \u201cget you\u201d. You can feel isolated and self-questioning when you don\u2019t have two or three people in your life who truly understand where you\u2019re coming from. Consider who those two or three people might be and invest in those relationships, taking steps to be open and honest with those you feel safe with and cared for by. Nurturing these relationships mean that it takes the pressure off and disempowers the importance of others \u201cgetting\u201d you.</p> <p><strong>7. I am not good enough. </strong>If you experience a feeling of \u201cnot being good enough\u201d, it may well be because you\u2019re not. Ask whether you don\u2019t feel good enough because the bar of expectation you\u2019ve set, or has been set for you, is simply too high to reach for alone. Sometimes when we question whether we\u2019re good enough, it\u2019s important to recognise that we may be asking ourselves \u201cam I perfect enough?\u201d. Amending the bar of expectation to reflect your humanly limited resources means you\u2019ll find you\u2019re more often than not \u201cgood enough\u201d to reach it.</p> <p><strong>8. Bad things will happen.</strong> Anxiety can make life feel as if you\u2019re in a waiting room for bad things to happen, meaning you miss out on the joy, adventure and rest that is there for the taking. Next time you feel a wave of anxiety roll over you, or you catch yourself ruminating over the worst-case scenarios, repeat the mantra, \u201cI will cross that bridge if I get to it.\u201d This doubles as a reminder that you have crossed many bridges of challenge thus far, and survived. The \u201cif\u201d reminds you that many of the things you fear don\u2019t come to fruition. It invites you to draw your attention to what <em>is</em> happening rather than what <em>may</em> happen.</p> <p><strong>9. I will lose people I love. </strong>This is a big one, isn\u2019t it? The instigator of nightmares and the theme of our worst-case scenarios. Grief and loss are the flipsides of the richness that love brings to our lives. If your fear of loss is creating a shadow over your enjoyment of the relationships that you have, seek out stories of those who have journeyed through healthy grief and found ways to build their life. Speak to friends who\u2019ve lost loved ones and are still living and thriving. When I fear that I couldn\u2019t withstand the heartbreak of losing one of my kids, I consider my mother who lives a full and happy life despite the unending awareness of who is missing.</p> <p><strong>10. I am going to die. </strong>In my book, I speak about a friend who told me she often feels aware that she\u2019s standing in one massive queue to her death, and has no idea of the position in the queue, nor can she change it. At first, I found this quite horrifying but, in time, I found it rather liberating. When you hold a gentle awareness of life\u2019s limitations in mind, it can prompt you to live more fully and in line with your values. When I come to the end of my life, I want to be glad I prioritised my relationships and didn\u2019t sweat the small stuff, so it prompts me to live in line with that value now. What about you?</p> <p>It can be confronting to see these truths in black and white. But we know, deep down, that these are truths that none of us can escape, and the less mental space the fear consumes, the more space you\u2019ll create for joy and authenticity.</p> <p>There is an African proverb that captures my motivation behind seeking more acceptance of these truths. It goes: \u201cWhen death finds you, may it find you alive.\u201d I don\u2019t want to wait until a curveball trauma forces me to be grateful for the joys in my life and the limited opportunity I have to embrace them, nor do I want to wait until I\u2019m older and (more) grey to care less what others think. I don\u2019t want to live a half-life blighted by fear of failure or bad things happening, and I don\u2019t want you to have that either.</p> <p><em>The Uncomfortable Truth by Anna Mathur is published by Penguin Life at \u00a316.99.

      "bodyText": "Has anyone ever told you to \u201cstop worrying\u201d or that \u201cit will all work out in the end\u201d? It doesn\u2019t really help, does it? After more than 10 years of working with clients as a psychotherapist, I am so aware of the headspace that worry and anxiety consumes. I know how uncertainty can taint otherwise wonderful experiences, catch us restless in the dark while those around us sleep, and find us living much of life from a braced position. As a child, I was full of worry, having lived through one of my own worst-case scenarios: losing a sibling. No matter how many times someone told me not to worry, it never silenced the thoughts and fears in my mind. How can someone reassure me that the worst probably won\u2019t happen when, in one way, it already has? We reassure each other that \u201cit\u2019s fine, nobody is judging you\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m sure that medical test will come back clear\u201d, yet these well-meaning words don\u2019t tend to offer much of the reassurance we crave, because we know full well that bad things do happen, we do get judged by others and there\u2019s always a chance the test will come back positive. Ploughing endless energy into trying to control the uncontrollable is keeping us all tired and troubled. The fact is that ignoring fears doesn\u2019t make them less true, it makes them more powerful. After years of struggling with my own anxiety, I decided to try a different tack \u2013 and it changed my world. Instead of doing everything I could to ease and avoid life\u2019s uncomfortable truths, I sought a deeper acceptance of them. Through using this approach, I discovered that anxiety finally began to loosen its grip. In researching my book I discovered 10 uncomfortable realities that many of us are afraid to face \u2013 ways you can thrive amid these uncertainties and embrace more of life\u2019s joy, despite full awareness of what\u2019s at stake. 1. Some people don\u2019t like me. Ask yourself this. If planning a holiday, would you trust an opinion given by someone who had never set foot in the country? Of course you wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019d seek advice from someone who had visited, stayed in a great location, eaten around the town. Remember this next time you find yourself ruminating over someone\u2019s judgment of you. If they don\u2019t truly know you, does their assessment deserve to take up so much bandwidth in your mind? 2. I am going to fail. If you are someone who fears failing at things, or you find your inner critic goes haywire when something didn\u2019t go as you\u2019d hoped, ask yourself whether your expectations were realistic. Remember, failing at something doesn\u2019t mean you are a failure, it just means that something didn\u2019t work out as you\u2019d hoped, either because your expectations were sky-high, something happened outside your control, or because you\u2019re a human who makes mistakes sometimes. 3. Life isn\u2019t fair. We can expend so much energy shaking our fist at life\u2019s curveballs and feeling the injustice of situations we see happening to or around us. It\u2019s important to seek fairness despite the fact that life isn\u2019t inherently fair. Bad things happen to good people, people hurt one another. But feeling like a victim of life\u2019s unfairness can keep us stuck and unmotivated. As we accept that life isn\u2019t fair, and stop shaking our fists, we free up energy to take a small (or large) step in doing something about it. 4. I will hurt people I love. Oh, the things we\u2019ve swallowed down and the truths we haven\u2019t told out of fear of hurting people. The thing is that, in avoiding honest (albeit sometimes difficult) conversations, we aren\u2019t protecting our treasured relationships as much as we like to think \u2013 we\u2019re welcoming an elephant into the room. It is your responsibility to be authentic and to do it as kindly as you can, but you cannot control how someone chooses to respond to that honesty. A good relationship can withstand healthy boundaries and tricky conversations. 5. I can\u2019t always be fully present. We are encouraged to be more mindful in our daily lives, but this can add pressure. Our minds are created to hop between awareness of the past, present and future. Instead of feeling guilty for not being \u201cpresent enough\u201d, here\u2019s a piece of advice. Every now and again, pause, look around and let your eyes rest on something beautiful, intriguing or interesting. Inhale and acknowledge what is going on in and around you. Now, as you reflect on your day, which may have passed in a busy blur, these are the moments that stay with you. 6. People misunderstand me. It can feel painful when, despite trying to articulate yourself, someone doesn\u2019t \u201cget you\u201d. You can feel isolated and self-questioning when you don\u2019t have two or three people in your life who truly understand where you\u2019re coming from. Consider who those two or three people might be and invest in those relationships, taking steps to be open and honest with those you feel safe with and cared for by. Nurturing these relationships mean that it takes the pressure off and disempowers the importance of others \u201cgetting\u201d you. 7. I am not good enough. If you experience a feeling of \u201cnot being good enough\u201d, it may well be because you\u2019re not. Ask whether you don\u2019t feel good enough because the bar of expectation you\u2019ve set, or has been set for you, is simply too high to reach for alone. Sometimes when we question whether we\u2019re good enough, it\u2019s important to recognise that we may be asking ourselves \u201cam I perfect enough?\u201d. Amending the bar of expectation to reflect your humanly limited resources means you\u2019ll find you\u2019re more often than not \u201cgood enough\u201d to reach it. 8. Bad things will happen. Anxiety can make life feel as if you\u2019re in a waiting room for bad things to happen, meaning you miss out on the joy, adventure and rest that is there for the taking. Next time you feel a wave of anxiety roll over you, or you catch yourself ruminating over the worst-case scenarios, repeat the mantra, \u201cI will cross that bridge if I get to it.\u201d This doubles as a reminder that you have crossed many bridges of challenge thus far, and survived.

By evening, the London activists had a surprise visit from Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the House of Representatives, who had originally been billed to join a zoom rally which was joined by other chapters based in locations ranging from Scotland to English university cities. \u201cMany of us have been living abroad for years, even decades, but we care deeply about what\u2019s at stake back home and we also want it to be a place that we still recognise when we return, whether that\u2019s a country where democracy has been preserved or even one that is still safe when it comes to the rights of women, our sisters and our daughters,\u201d said Kristin Wolfe, Chair of Democrats Abroad UK and a resident in London since 2007. The potential role of overseas Americans voters \u2013 who do not appear in national polls \u2013 should not be underestimated. In 2020 their votes made all the difference when it came to delivering the key swing states of Arizona and Georgia to Joe Biden. With the race so tight and the stakes this high \u2013 Wolfe\u2019s voice cracks as she insists that US democracy is imperilled in a way not seen since the American civil war \u2013 Harris supporters in the UK have raised their game. At bus shelters in parts of London with higher concentrations of Americans you\u2019ll find adverts placed strategically by the group. For the first time too, digital advertising aimed at the community is being deployed on Google. There are also efforts to reach out and encourage voter registration face to face, such as at freshers\u2019 fairs in Oxford. On other recent weekend afternoons, activists set up open-air tables in Hyde Park and at Marylebone Farmer\u2019s Market in London to catch any passing Americans. Among curious passersby who stopped at the market table was the British pop star, Harry Styles, although the singer is not known to have a US passport. That said, Democrats in the UK have suddenly found a local celebrity of their own in the form of Matt Klaber, who was a student at the high school where Tim Walz once taught and who recently spoke in London at a \u201cre-watch\u201d of the vice-presidential debate. Klaber \u2013 a London-based software engineer and Democratic activist \u2013 also played a role in Walz\u2019s own political \u201corigin story\u201d when he took students to see a George W Bush campaign rally in 2004, only for some of them to be turned away by organisers who believed they were Democrats. The experience led Walz to seek public office. One of those students was Klaber, who insists that Walz\u2019s wholesome public persona is exactly true to the one he and others have long known in person. \u201cMy earliest recollection of Tim is of being in the school library and seeing him rush out with his jacket and briefcase because he was being activated as a national guardsman who was going to help lead the response to some flooding,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole campaign metaphor of being a coach might have been a bit foreign to me as I wasn\u2019t necessarily into sports, but actually they\u2019ve nailed it.

So too are efforts to counter misinformation in the form of misleading claims by Donald Trump that Democrats were somehow preparing to \u201ccheat\u201d and that ballots were being sent overseas without proper checks. \u201cThat\u2019s just so blatantly false because the truth is that processes of the most rigorous kind are in place,\u201d said Wolfe, who accuses Trump of seeking to intentionally confuse and mislead because he is concerned about the potential impact of overseas voters.",

But a new documentary about the couple exposes the eerie similarities between the 70s and now, the Oscar-winning director behind the film has said. One to One, by Kevin Macdonald, portrays Lennon and Ono\u2019s life over an 18-month period after their move to New York in 1971, when they quickly became figureheads for the counterculture and anti-Vietnam war movements. Showing at the London film festival, it centres around the 1972 One to One benefit concert at Madison Square Garden \u2013 Lennon\u2019s last full-length concert and his only one after the Beatles \u2013 performed in aid of children with special needs. \u201cWhat I hadn\u2019t realised until I started making this was that the period seems like an incredible echo of today, it\u2019s like a mirror image,\u201d Macdonald said. His film incorporates newly restored 16mm film footage of the concert, archival news clips \u2013 of the Attica prison riot, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam war and the shooting of the Alabama governor George Wallace \u2013 as well as previously unheard tapes of Lennon and Ono\u2019s private phone calls, recorded by them when they became concerned the FBI was tapping their communications.

However, the Post Office continued to use the court system for the civil recovery of losses from branches until 2018. In the wake of damning high court judgments a year later, the state-owned company currently only pursues losses if there is an agreement with the branch owner-operator, or assists the police if the issue is of a scale that it may become a criminal case.

The claim raises the intriguing prospect that the man who played a central part in the creation of Spain\u2019s mighty empire hailed from the very community that his patrons, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, expelled from their kingdom in the same year Columbus reached the Americas. The findings of the investigation were announced on Saturday night during a special programme shown on the national broadcaster, RTVE, to coincide with Spain\u2019s national day, which commemorates Columbus\u2019s arrival in the New World on 12 October 1492. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Lorente, a forensic medical expert at the University of Granada who has led the research, said his analysis had revealed that Columbus\u2019s DNA was \u201ccompatible\u201d with a Jewish origin. \u201cWe have very partial, but sufficient, DNA from Christopher Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have DNA from his son Fernando Col\u00f3n, and in both the Y [male] chromosome and mitochondrial DNA [transmitted by the mother] of Fernando there are traces compatible with a Jewish origin.\u201d While Lorente acknowledged that he had not been able to pinpoint Columbus\u2019s place of birth, he said the likelihood was that he had come from the Spanish Mediterranean region. \u201cThe DNA indicates that Christopher Columbus\u2019s origin lay in the western Mediterranean,\u201d said the researcher. \u201cIf there weren\u2019t Jews in Genoa in the 15th century, the likelihood that he was from there is minimal.

That all means that his most likely origin is in the Spanish Mediterranean area or the Balearic islands which belonged to the crown of Arag\u00f3n at the time.\u201d According to RTVE, Lorente\u2019s findings have put an end to 500 years of speculation over Columbus\u2019s birthplace and nationality.

After analysing 25 possible places, then focusing on a shortlist of eight, Lorente alighted on western Europe. His history-changing conclusions, however, have been greeted with extreme caution by some of his peers. \u201cUnfortunately, from a scientific point of view, we can\u2019t really evaluate what was in the documentary because they offered no data from the analysis whatsoever,\u201d Antonio Alonso, a geneticist and former director of Spain\u2019s National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Sciences told El Pa\u00eds. \u201cMy conclusion is that the documentary never shows Columbus\u2019s DNA and, as scientists, we don\u2019t know what analysis was undertaken.\u201d Rodrigo Barquera, an expert in archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, said he was surprised the findings had been shared without prior scrutiny from others in the scientific community. \u201cNormally, you send your article to a scientific journal,\u201d he told El Pa\u00eds. \u201cAn editor is then assigned to the piece and at least three independent reviewers examine the work and decide whether it\u2019s scientifically valid or not.

Centuries of persecution, pogroms and regional expulsions culminated in 1492 when the country\u2019s Jewish population was ordered into exile, forced to convert to Catholicism or burned at the stake. In 2015 Spain sought to atone for the expulsion, which it termed \u201ca historic mistake\u201d by passing a time-limited law offering Spanish citizenship to the descendants of the Jews who were driven from the country at the end of the 15th century. About 132,000 people of Sephardic descent applied for citizenship before the offer elapsed in October 2019. More than half of those who applied were from Latin American countries including Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, Panama, Chile and Ecuador.",

      "bodyText": "Israel has ordered more evacuations in southern Lebanon and threatened to target ambulances, as a fifth UN peacekeeper was wounded in Israel\u2019s escalating conflict with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. Israel\u2019s military on Saturday ordered people in 23 southern Lebanese villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali River, which flows from the western Bekaa valley into the Mediterranean. The order, communicated via a military statement, mentioned villages in southern Lebanon that have been recent targets of Israeli attacks, many of which are already almost empty. The Israeli military also claimed on Saturday, without providing evidence, that Hezbollah militants were using ambulances to transport themselves and weapons and called on medical teams to \u201cavoid dealing with Hezbollah operatives and not to cooperate with them\u201d. In a post on X, the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) Arabic spokesperson threatened that it would target \u201cany vehicle carrying armed men, regardless of its type\u201d. The Lebanese health ministry said on X on Saturday that five hospitals had sustained damage from the Israeli airstrikes in the eastern city of Baalbek and the Bekaa valley. The Israeli military had no immediate comment, and it was not possible to independently verify the hospital strikes. The Guardian has previously reported that at least 50 paramedics have been killed since Israel launched its most recent attacks on Lebanon. All have belonged to healthcare services affiliated with either Hezbollah or Amal, another Shia political party \u2013 affiliations that rights experts say do not affect their protected status under international law. The medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) last week was forced to close its clinic in a southern suburb of Beirut and temporarily stop its activities in another one in the north, because of heavy airstrikes, the group said in a statement on Thursday. A UN report last week accused Israel of pursuing a concerted policy of destroying Gaza\u2019s healthcare system in the war in the strip, including \u201crelentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities\u201d, saying this constituted war crimes and extermination as a crime against humanity. Israel, which accuses the UN of institutional bias against it and claims Hamas hides in healthcare facilities, rejected the findings. At least 15 people were killed and 37 wounded in Israeli strikes across three different areas in Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry said on Saturday. One of the targeted locations was in the town of Deir Billa in northern Lebanon, which had not been struck before. A marketplace in the southern city of Nabatieh was also targeted. Nine people were killed and 15 injured in the village of Maaysra, a mostly Christian mountain area north of Beirut, while four were killed and 18 injured in Barja in the Shouf district south of the capital, the ministry said. In Deir Billa, the ministry reported two dead, four wounded and \u201cbody parts\u201d after an Israeli strike. DNA tests were being carried out to determine the identity of the remains, the statement added. Lebanon\u2019s official National News Agency had said an \u201cIsraeli strike\u201d targeted a house in the village where families from south Lebanon had taken refuge. The Israeli military, meanwhile, said Hezbollah had fired nearly 320 projectiles from Lebanon into Israel on Saturday, without giving further details. It declared areas around some towns in north Israel closed to the public. Another member of Unifil, the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, was struck by gunfire on Friday, the organisation said on Saturday, adding that the man was stable after undergoing surgery to remove the bullet. The statement also said Unifil\u2019s position in the southern Lebanese town of Ramyah sustained significant damage as a result of explosions after nearby shelling, but did not specify who was responsible for either attack. A total of five UN peacekeepers were injured on Thursday and Friday when the Israeli military fired on the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon on three occasions, drawing condemnations from the global body and various countries. Unifil has accused Israel of deliberately targeting its positions. A group of 40 countries participating in the Unifil mission issued a joint statement on Saturday condemning the recent attacks on the peacekeepers\u2019 base and calling for all parties to ensure their safety. \u201cSuch actions must stop immediately and should be adequately investigated,\u201d said the joint statement, posted on X by the Polish UN mission and signed by countries including leading contributors Indonesia, Italy and India. The Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, said his government would ask the UN security council to issue a new resolution calling for a \u201cfull and immediate ceasefire\u201d. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, in a call on Saturday with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d about reports that Israeli forces had fired on UN peacekeeping positions in recent days and urged Israel to ensure safety for them and the Lebanese military, the Pentagon said. Austin also \u201creinforced the need to pivot from military operations in Lebanon to a diplomatic pathway as soon as feasible\u201d, according to the Pentagon statement. Hezbollah said it had attacked the outskirts of Tel Aviv with a swarm of drones on Friday, without giving further details. Israel said there were no casualties reported when its military detected and intercepted two drones from Lebanon. The Israeli military claimed it had hit about 200 targets in Lebanon with artillery and airstrikes and killed about 50 Hezbollah fighters and dismantled dozens of weapons storage sites. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants erupted one year ago when the Iranian-backed group began launching rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas on 8 October, at the start of the war in Gaza. It has intensified in recent weeks, with Israel bombing southern Lebanon, Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and the Bekaa valley, killing many of Hezbollah\u2019s leaders, and sending ground troops across the border. Hezbollah, for its part, has fired rockets deeper into Israel. The Israeli campaign has forced approximately 1.2 million people from their homes since 23 September, according to the Lebanese government. Israel says its Lebanon offensive aims to secure the return home of tens of thousands of people who evacuated from northern Israel because of Hezbollah rocket fire. As of Friday the death toll had reached 2,255 since the beginning of hostilities, the Lebanese health ministry said on Saturday. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Saturday that more Lebanese people had been displaced than during the last major war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, when about 1 million fled their homes.

      "body": "<p>Last Wednesday, the announcement that Conservative MPs had decided on a conclusive leadership battle between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-conservative-leadership-contest-normality-is-not-on-the-ballot\">Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick</a> was greeted in non-Tory circles by an outpouring of mirth. One Labour parliamentarian texted the Guardian\u2019s political editor to jokily wonder whether the result needed to be <a href=\"https://x.com/PippaCrerar/status/1844026683260838066\">declared as yet another gift</a>. Rumours that the shock outcome was the consequence of James Cleverly\u2019s supporters assuming he had an unassailable lead and <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/did-rogue-voting-and-botched-plot-by-mps-cost-cleverlys-shock-loss-in-tory-leadership-race-13231065\">cynically backing Robert Jenrick</a> as his most beatable opponent were the clincher: here was yet another instalment of the Tory pantomime that has now been running for nearly a decade. \u201cA lot of very serious analysis awaits,\u201d said the LBC presenter James O\u2019Brien, \u201cbut <a href=\"https://x.com/mrjamesob/status/1844026936127017442\">this is all objectively hilarious</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>In so far as Badenoch and Jenrick seemingly have no interest in the reasons why their party so comprehensively lost the election, all the amusement is understandable.

Meanwhile, a huge cloud of toxic rightwing politics \u2013 full of racism, conspiracy theory and hare-brained economics \u2013 hangs over much of the world, the UK included.</p> \n<p>Make no mistake: the fact that Jenrick and Badenoch have chosen to position themselves in such close proximity to the new global right is hugely significant. One-nation Conservatism could be heading for extinction: its key standard-bearer this time, Tom Tugendhat, ran an incoherent and doomed campaign, and even if Cleverly had made it through to the final round, his insistence that his party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/02/james-cleverly-conservative-leadership-bid-tories\">should \u201cbe more normal\u201d</a> may well have been too much for the membership to bear.

      "body": "<p>Jude Bellingham is perhaps the most well-documented footballer in history. Well, at his age at least. Sky Sports, Deutsche Welle, Copa90, Borussia Dortmund and Birmingham all produced documentaries about him before his 21st birthday. It\u2019s clear to see why. His transformation from Birmingham\u2019s youngest ever player to a world-beating gal\u00e1ctico in the space of five years is remarkable.</p> <p>His performances on the pitch last season, picking up the award for La Liga player of the season, winning the Champions League and scoring a perfectly timed bicycle kick at Euro 2024, prompted fans and journalists alike to ask \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/haIajude/status/1807498764388598125\">who writes your scripts?</a>\u201d. As it turns out, Bellingham Media Ltd does.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/13/kylian-mbappe-symbol-of-malaise-amid-france-generational-shift\">Kylian Mbapp\u00e9: the symbol of malaise amid France\u2019s generational shift</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company has produced the latest addition to Jude lore with <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF-ZvueXcg8&amp;t=1s\">Out of the Floodlights</a></em>, a four-part docuseries that follows the midfielder\u2019s journey from his last game at Borussia Dortmund to the final of Euro 2024 with England.</p> <p>The series is well-shot, produced and edited, blending traditional talking head setups with more casual, fly-on-the-wall moments. It juggles the idea that Bellingham is a superstar but also a regular person like you and me as we follow him to award shows, photoshoots and his home. With its emotional ebbs and flows, the documentary is by far the best offering in the catalogue of films about him.</p> <p>But, more than anything, the series is an example of how footballers are taking control of their own narrative and understanding their value. Bellingham\u2019s documentary is almost all from his perspective, as well as some moments when you hear from his loved ones. He has created a safe space in which he can speak to his fans and critics, often looking down the barrel of the lens in his interviews, as if talking directly to them.</p>    <p>Of course, the path Bellingham is walking has been trodden before. David Beckham, to whom Bellingham is sometimes compared, won an Emmy recently for his <em>Beckham </em>documentary.</p> <p>In it, Beckham speaks about some of the most controversial moments in his career, sometimes for the first time publicly. While documentaries in which the superstar protagonist plays such a dominant role \u2013 as also seen in Michael Jordan\u2019s <em>The Last Dance</em> \u2013 are never going to be the most critical, they offer an opportunity for a celebrity to finally speak about how they have been reported.</p> <p>The difference with the current crop of sportspeople is that they\u2019re choosing to shape narratives more quickly and on their own platforms.</p> <p>Cristiano Ronaldo turned to Piers Morgan to conduct the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk9uJRMvBIA\">controversial interview</a> that led to the forward\u2019s transfer from Manchester United to Al-Nassr. This year however, fresh off the back of creating his own YouTube channel, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t40HXEc6c84&amp;t=1764s\">he tapped his old mate Rio Ferdinand to interview him </a>about a range of topics, including his thoughts on the current Manchester United team.</p>    <p>UR Cristiano, whose subscriber base is almost equivalent to the total population of Britain, has realised the value of creating narratives on his own platform. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/12/eric-ten-hag-hits-back-at-cristiano-ronaldo-manchester-united-comments\">Erik ten Hag himself was then asked about the interview</a> which had taken place thousands of miles away in the comfort of Ronaldo\u2019s memorabilia room. What\u2019s more, the revenue generated , goes to him and his team \u2013 not that he particularly needs it.</p> <p>Other footballers are also using their platforms to express themselves. Rafael Le\u00e3o, sometimes criticised on social media for focusing too much on fashion and music rather than his football, uses his YouTube channel to vlog. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-bZQNFLTx4\">In one video</a>, we see the Milan forward travel to London to promote his own clothing brand Son Is Son, meet fashion designer Clint Ogbenna and lay down a verse in a recording studio.</p> <p>His videos simultaneously confirm and confound the narratives surrounding him. Yes, he\u2019s interested in other things outside football but his performances on the pitch speak for themselves. He shows that like us (we hope), he\u2019s not defined by his day job, and the lo-fi nature of the vlogs help audiences connect with him more than an overproduced film ever could.</p>    <p>Social media encourages us to form parasocial relationships with footballers.

      "bodyText": "Jude Bellingham is perhaps the most well-documented footballer in history. Well, at his age at least. Sky Sports, Deutsche Welle, Copa90, Borussia Dortmund and Birmingham all produced documentaries about him before his 21st birthday. It\u2019s clear to see why. His transformation from Birmingham\u2019s youngest ever player to a world-beating gal\u00e1ctico in the space of five years is remarkable. His performances on the pitch last season, picking up the award for La Liga player of the season, winning the Champions League and scoring a perfectly timed bicycle kick at Euro 2024, prompted fans and journalists alike to ask \u201cwho writes your scripts?\u201d. As it turns out, Bellingham Media Ltd does. The company has produced the latest addition to Jude lore with Out of the Floodlights, a four-part docuseries that follows the midfielder\u2019s journey from his last game at Borussia Dortmund to the final of Euro 2024 with England. The series is well-shot, produced and edited, blending traditional talking head setups with more casual, fly-on-the-wall moments. It juggles the idea that Bellingham is a superstar but also a regular person like you and me as we follow him to award shows, photoshoots and his home. With its emotional ebbs and flows, the documentary is by far the best offering in the catalogue of films about him. But, more than anything, the series is an example of how footballers are taking control of their own narrative and understanding their value. Bellingham\u2019s documentary is almost all from his perspective, as well as some moments when you hear from his loved ones. He has created a safe space in which he can speak to his fans and critics, often looking down the barrel of the lens in his interviews, as if talking directly to them. Of course, the path Bellingham is walking has been trodden before. David Beckham, to whom Bellingham is sometimes compared, won an Emmy recently for his Beckham documentary. In it, Beckham speaks about some of the most controversial moments in his career, sometimes for the first time publicly. While documentaries in which the superstar protagonist plays such a dominant role \u2013 as also seen in Michael Jordan\u2019s The Last Dance \u2013 are never going to be the most critical, they offer an opportunity for a celebrity to finally speak about how they have been reported. The difference with the current crop of sportspeople is that they\u2019re choosing to shape narratives more quickly and on their own platforms. Cristiano Ronaldo turned to Piers Morgan to conduct the controversial interview that led to the forward\u2019s transfer from Manchester United to Al-Nassr. This year however, fresh off the back of creating his own YouTube channel, he tapped his old mate Rio Ferdinand to interview him about a range of topics, including his thoughts on the current Manchester United team. UR Cristiano, whose subscriber base is almost equivalent to the total population of Britain, has realised the value of creating narratives on his own platform. Erik ten Hag himself was then asked about the interview which had taken place thousands of miles away in the comfort of Ronaldo\u2019s memorabilia room. What\u2019s more, the revenue generated , goes to him and his team \u2013 not that he particularly needs it. Other footballers are also using their platforms to express themselves. Rafael Le\u00e3o, sometimes criticised on social media for focusing too much on fashion and music rather than his football, uses his YouTube channel to vlog. In one video, we see the Milan forward travel to London to promote his own clothing brand Son Is Son, meet fashion designer Clint Ogbenna and lay down a verse in a recording studio. His videos simultaneously confirm and confound the narratives surrounding him. Yes, he\u2019s interested in other things outside football but his performances on the pitch speak for themselves. He shows that like us (we hope), he\u2019s not defined by his day job, and the lo-fi nature of the vlogs help audiences connect with him more than an overproduced film ever could. Social media encourages us to form parasocial relationships with footballers. It\u2019s easier than ever to feel as if you know them because you get a glimpse into their lives. But there will always remain a barrier that will prevent you from really learning too much about your favourite player. There\u2019s too much at stake for anyone still working. They\u2019ve got to satisfy their employer, their sponsors and themselves. The result is a curated product that lacks the critique of an article or the depth of a retrospective film on somebody\u2019s life. But that\u2019s not the point. This content is made for us to buy into the brands of Jude Bellingham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Rafael Le\u00e3o. To see them as individuals outside their sport and ultimately invest more time and money into them.",

The bad news is that they are more likely to be ill. </p> <p>The study analysed data from the US, the UK and mainland Europe and found that people in their 60s and 70s experience greater multiple health problems, including obesity and diabetes, than the previous generation. But it would be wrong to assume that poor health is simply the price of a longer life. </p> <p>According to the lead author of the study, Laura Gimeno, from UCL\u2019s centre for longitudinal studies: \u201cWe find that there is a generational health drift, whereby younger generations tend to have worse health than previous generations at the same age.\u201d</p>    <p>This unfolding health crisis has implications for the government, the NHS and society at large, but perhaps the people, other than the infirm themselves, most affected are those dealing with ailing parents and<em> </em>young<em> </em>children or teenagers \u2013 the \u201csandwich generation\u201d. </p> <p>It\u2019s not a new demographic and its tensions have been well captured in films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/jan/21/features.review17\"><em>Little Miss Sunshine</em></a>, in which the sandwiched family was sandwiched in a VW camper van. </p> <p>The term was first popularised by US sociologists Dorothy Miller and Elaine Brody in 1981. Miller wrote of \u201cadult children\u201d who were exposed to \u201ca unique set of unshared stresses in which giving of resources and service far outweighs receiving them.\u201d </p> <p>In the past four decades, however, those unshared stresses have steadily grown across the developed world as people live longer and with greater infirmity. </p> <p>The declining health of older generations has coincided with more parental demands such as the spread of attention-rich \u201cgentle parenting\u201d, the rise in anxiety and depression among teenagers, and the delayed departures from the family home of children in their 20s. </p> <p>One poll estimated that 6 million Britons now consider themselves to be in this sandwich generation. Increased longevity has also added another designation to the social menu: the four generation \u201cclub sandwich\u201d, in which the 40s-60s may have some economic or care responsibility for their children, grandchildren and parents, or alternatively the 20s-40s may be in a similar position with their children, parents and grandparents. </p> <p>David Goodhart, the head of demography, immigration and integration at the conservative thinktank Policy Exchange, has just written a book entitled <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-care-dilemma-9781800753617/\"><em>Care Dilemma: Caring Enough in the Age of Sex Equality</em></a>. His thesis is that family obligations have been disproportionately borne by women, but that greater equality has led to a deficit in care, and an ever-increasing and more costly role for the state.</p> <p>He argues that the solution is not \u201cto push back against equality but to raise the status of care, a realm that has traditionally been female\u201d.</p> <p>To many women, it\u2019s a realm that remains stubbornly female. As one middle-aged woman carer of elderly parents says: \u201cIt is always the daughters who are expected to care, unless there are no daughters, in which case it will generally be the sons with a lot of support from their wives.\u201d</p>    <p>Annalisa Barbieri, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/ask-annalisa-barbieri\"><em>Guardian</em>\u2019s family agony aunt</a>, says the picture that emerges from her correspondents is of men who tend \u201cto absolve themselves of responsibility, either by moving away or just not being emotional about it\u201d.</p> <p>Goodhart accepts that total equality has yet to arrive, though he points out that the share of domestic labour has shifted from 70:30 25 years ago to 60:40 today. But he maintains that his argument is really about reordering of society\u2019s priorities to liberate women and men to play more active and beneficial roles as carers. </p> <p>\u201cIf we valued care work in the home and the public economy more we would make it easier for one parent to stay at home, at least while kids are preschool \u2013 something which is very popular \u2013 but such valuable care work tends to be associated with women\u2019s past, not their future,\u201d he says.</p> <p>To critics who find talk of enhanced family stability a conservative argument that amounts to a return to traditional roles, Goodhart believes that empowering women to be able to combine motherhood and work less stressfully, and the reduction in child poverty that unified families provide, should be \u201can idea that liberals support\u201d. </p> <p>Family therapist Jennifer Achan says that while there is a gender \u00addisparity in society at large, most of the clients who come to her with multigenerational issues happen to be men: \u201cIt\u2019s usually because they\u2019re&nbsp;struggling with their marriage as a result of splitting their time between their family and caring for a parent, or their mother moving into the family home and the wife not being happy.\u201d </p> <p>Laura, a 50-year-old who has three teenagers, is one of three sisters sharing responsibility for an ailing 91-year-old father who lives 90 minutes\u2019 drive away (the names of interviewees have been changed).</p> <p>\u201cIt becomes a little bit: \u2018Why can\u2019t you go over there? I did the last two times,\u2019\u2009\u201d she says of the resentments that can form around parental care. \u201cBut you have to get over that and realise that people are doing what they can.\u201d</p> <p>For Philippa, who is in her mid-50s, getting over it has proved to be a challenging task. She felt abandoned by her brother when their mother started to show signs of dementia. \u201cHe responded to her cognitive decline by moving to the other side of the country, leaving me to care for our mother,\u201d she says, still smarting at the memory. \u201cIt\u2019s been so hard, I can\u2019t even describe it.\u201d</p> <p>As Tolstoy\u2019s famous dictum about unhappy families implied, intergenerational dynamics are complex and&nbsp;infinitely varied. But if every struggling familial setup is unique, some are more unique, as it were, than others. </p> <p>Take, for example, the case of Michael, a 60-year-old builder and writer living in Devon. He has a one-year-old daughter with his partner, who both live in Belgium, a 20-year-old son from a previous marriage studying at university and an 87-year-old father in Derbyshire. </p> <p>\u201cMy father is fiercely independent but when my mother died five years ago, his drinking, which had always been heavy, began to become a bigger problem,\u201d he says. </p> <p>On a visit to see his suspiciously uncommunicative father, Michael discovered bank statements littered around the house that showed strange online expenses. Further investigation revealed that the octogenarian had been buying items for an online \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and spending large sums of money on pornography, chatlines and women\u2019s underwear. </p> <p>\u201cHe was being manipulated and had spent 20 grand in two months,\u201d says Michael, who was forced to gain power of attorney to pull the plug on these unaffordable credit card sprees. </p> <p>While he recognises the inherent complications of having such a geographically and chronologically diffuse family, Michael says that all but one part of it works well enough. The problem is the anxieties that part provokes are not easy to contain. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/almost-half-of-working-age-women-in-uk-do-45-hours-of-unpaid-care-a-week-study\">Almost half of working-age women in UK do 45 hours of unpaid care a week \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy dad is the biggest worry because everything is a struggle with him,\u201d says Michael. \u201cWe\u2019ve approached it from every way, tried love, understanding, anger \u2013 and now there\u2019s a feeling of despair.\u201d</p> <p>Although Michael\u2019s relationship with his Finnish partner in Belgium remains solid, Achan says that many couples reach burnout and then break up as a consequence of the pressures of dealing with children going through development stages, while having to look after parents. </p> <p>The whole issue of care is one that within the family context is fraught with guilt and shame, which by their nature are private and often well-guarded emotions.

I feel really guilty. So there is no satisfaction, no feeling that you\u2019re making somebody\u2019s life better.\u201d</p> <p>For Emma, a 59-year-old divorced mother of four children, who are all still at home, the guilt comes from her mother\u2019s resistance to help. Emma has asked her mother to move in with her several times, but the 90-year-old is adamant that she doesn\u2019t want to be an imposition. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I drive past her house and see her sitting in a chair on her own, it poleaxes me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Yet a further divisive strand of this knotted issue is the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/03/mps-vote-first-time-assisted-dying-bill-uk-parliament\">assisted dying becoming legal</a> in England and Wales. Although the law would be restricted to very specific cases of terminally ill people, it could, say opponents, inadvertently encourage elderly people to see themselves as unnecessary burdens. </p> <p>Perhaps the one point thatall interested parties can agree upon is that all forms of care \u2013 for young and elderly people \u2013 have been neglected by us as a society, pushed to the margins or back into private settings, where all the accompanying anguish and frustration have been left to fester.</p> <p>Whether or not one agrees with Goodhart\u2019s social perspective, it\u2019s hard to dispute that our attitudes and practices relating to care are due for a radical overhaul. We have to rethink the needs and dignity of people at all stages of life, to humanise these most human of situations. No one should be the meat in a demographic sandwich that is long past its sell-by date.</p>",

Emma has asked her mother to move in with her several times, but the 90-year-old is adamant that she doesn\u2019t want to be an imposition. \u201cWhen I drive past her house and see her sitting in a chair on her own, it poleaxes me,\u201d she says. Yet a further divisive strand of this knotted issue is the prospect of assisted dying becoming legal in England and Wales. Although the law would be restricted to very specific cases of terminally ill people, it could, say opponents, inadvertently encourage elderly people to see themselves as unnecessary burdens. Perhaps the one point thatall interested parties can agree upon is that all forms of care \u2013 for young and elderly people \u2013 have been neglected by us as a society, pushed to the margins or back into private settings, where all the accompanying anguish and frustration have been left to fester. Whether or not one agrees with Goodhart\u2019s social perspective, it\u2019s hard to dispute that our attitudes and practices relating to care are due for a radical overhaul. We have to rethink the needs and dignity of people at all stages of life, to humanise these most human of situations. No one should be the meat in a demographic sandwich that is long past its sell-by date.",

The Guardian spoke to experts about what steps the government needs to take to have some hope of halving violence against women in a decade.</p> <p><strong>Half of what, exactly?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s no use saying you are going to halve VAWG without clearly stating what indicators you are going to use. <a href=\"https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/\">The End Violence Against Women Coalition</a> (EVAW) has suggested annual targets to bring down the number of women killed by men. Increases in prosecutions for VAWG-related crimes such as rape and domestic abuse could also be looked at. Katrin Hohl, the government\u2019s independent sexual violence adviser, warns that an approach that is too target-driven risks being counter-productive. \u201cIt\u2019s great that the government wants to be held to account, but the focus needs to be on walking the walk, not hitting a headline-friendly target,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong>Fix the </strong><strong>roof</strong></p> <p>New policies and laws are headline-grabbing, but in some cases theoretically good systems exist \u2013 they just don\u2019t work. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/24/operation-bluestone-inside-new-police-approach-to-tackling-rape\">Operation Soteria Bluestone</a>, a series of new rape policies brought in after a collapse in prosecutions, has yielded results: police rape referrals to the CPS <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2024-02-19/debates/24021971000015/ProgressReportOnTheImplementationOfTheRapeReviewActionPlan\">are up by 219%</a> from the quarterly average in 2019.</p> <p>Protection orders are a case in point, argues Hohl. Often police don\u2019t know how to use them and courts have no time to hear applications. When imposed, they too often fail to be flagged on internal systems; when breached, nothing is done. \u201cVictims might have actually been placed at more risk because the system is not effective,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the government was to reach for existing solutions, fixing the system of protective orders needs to be a priority.\u201d</p> <p>The chronically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/mar/11/cps-report-makes-for-grim-reading-and-its-only-the-start\">underfunded Crown Prosecution Service</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/article/2024/jun/16/people-should-not-wait-two-years-to-be-tried-inside-the-crown-court-crisis\">a crumbling court system</a> are huge challenges.

But by May this year the previous government was already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/16/first-edition-sex-education\">looking to roll it back</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/may/14/sex-education-in-english-schools-set-to-be-banned-before-children-are-nine\">new draft guidance</a> put forward. That draft needs putting in the bin, she suggests. \u201cThe 2019 guidance is still good; it\u2019s still in scope and schools need to be using it,\u201d she says. She argues RSE should be treated like other critical subjects, with a dedicated team of teachers, and be rolled out in higher education, as called for by the youth-led grassroots campaign <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/makeitmandatory/\">\u201cMake it Mandatory\u201d</a>.</p> <p><strong>Data</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s hard to tackle a problem if you don\u2019t know the full extent of what is going wrong.

His government would, he pledged, halve violence against women and girls in a decade. It was a bold, simple statement, widely welcomed for its ambition. That something has to change is not in doubt. The first national analysis of the scale of violence against women and girls (VAWG) released in July by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) estimated that 2 million women were victims of male violence every year \u2013 an epidemic so serious it amounts to a \u201cnational emergency\u201d. VAWG crimes account for 20% of all police-recorded crime. On average, a woman is killed by a man in the UK every three days. One in 12 women in England and Wales will experience stalking, harassment, sexual assault or domestic violence. The number of recorded offences has grown by 37% in the past five years. So far, the government has given little detail about how it will measure its success. It has, however, already given some indicators of shifts in policy. Perhaps the most significant is that VAWG will be considered central to the pledge to create \u201csafer streets\u201d, one of the government\u2019s five central \u201cmissions\u201d. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has said this will mean that all departments are working together to tackle the problem. Jess Phillips, the VAWG minister, told the Guardian that support for victims and effective policing would be crucial, and pointed to already announced policies, adding: \u201cThese are the first steps toward what I hope will be real, tangible change.\u201d Those first steps include: Embedding domestic abuse specialists in 999 control rooms. A pilot of new domestic abuse protection orders to force more domestic abusers to stay away from their victims or face tougher sanctions. Powers given to six police forces to charge domestic abuse suspects without first going to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Specialist advisers for victims in domestic abuse, rape and sexual assault cases. Plans to tackle sexism in schools, including training young male influencers to combat the toxic messages from people such as Andrew Tate. But what else needs to happen? The Guardian spoke to experts about what steps the government needs to take to have some hope of halving violence against women in a decade. Half of what, exactly? It\u2019s no use saying you are going to halve VAWG without clearly stating what indicators you are going to use. The End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW) has suggested annual targets to bring down the number of women killed by men. Increases in prosecutions for VAWG-related crimes such as rape and domestic abuse could also be looked at. Katrin Hohl, the government\u2019s independent sexual violence adviser, warns that an approach that is too target-driven risks being counter-productive. \u201cIt\u2019s great that the government wants to be held to account, but the focus needs to be on walking the walk, not hitting a headline-friendly target,\u201d she says. Fix the roof New policies and laws are headline-grabbing, but in some cases theoretically good systems exist \u2013 they just don\u2019t work. Operation Soteria Bluestone, a series of new rape policies brought in after a collapse in prosecutions, has yielded results: police rape referrals to the CPS are up by 219% from the quarterly average in 2019. Protection orders are a case in point, argues Hohl. Often police don\u2019t know how to use them and courts have no time to hear applications. When imposed, they too often fail to be flagged on internal systems; when breached, nothing is done. \u201cVictims might have actually been placed at more risk because the system is not effective,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the government was to reach for existing solutions, fixing the system of protective orders needs to be a priority.\u201d The chronically underfunded Crown Prosecution Service and a crumbling court system are huge challenges. According to the Criminal Bar Association, there is a \u201ccritical\u201d shortage of specialist barristers to prosecute and defend in rape cases. As of March, the number of sexual offence cases waiting to go to trial was at a record high. The government has promised to establish 80 new rape courts across England and Wales to fast-track cases. \u201cThe criminal justice system must treat survivors with compassion, dignity and respect,\u201d says Ciara Bergman, the CEO of Rape Crisis England and Wales. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible when they are left in the dark, waiting for court dates that never come or are rearranged at the last minute.\u201d Education, education, education Lucy Emmerson, the chief executive of the Sex Education Forum, argues that comprehensive sex education is a crucial preventive tool.

Help perpetrators to stop Experts also argue that perpetrator programmes have to be part of the solution, despite society\u2019s discomfort with spending money on domestic abusers and sex offenders.

Offenders \u2013 including those in police forces, and for crimes such as flashing, harassment and stalking \u2013 should be aggressively pursued and disrupted. Too often this isn\u2019t happening.

Victims and families also desperately need support in the aftermath of violence, she adds. Police chiefs say they know the situation has to improve, and have promised better targeting of offenders through technology and intelligence, which they say will be helped by the creation of a dedicated policing hub, the National Centre for Public Protection. It\u2019s the funding, stupid VAWG costs society an estimated \u00a340bn each year. Since last year, violence against women and girls has been officially classed as a national threat in line with counter-terrorism, but, according to insiders, receives a fraction of the funding. The women and girls sector received just 1.8% of a total \u00a34.1bn-worth of grants awarded to charities in 2021. Of these, a third went to organisations with no specific focus on women and girls. The Ministry of Justice\u2019s current funding for victim support services runs out in March 2025; as yet, there is no replacement plan. \u201cWe need money and we need it quickly,\u201d says the CEO of Women\u2019s Aid, Farah Nazeer. Imkaan, a non-profit organisation that delivers specialist services for black and minoritised women, argues that the tendering processes too often cut out specialist organisations. \u201cWe need money ringfenced for organisations like ours to continue to provide vital support,\u201d says its co-director Ghadah Alnasseri. A seat at the table Charities have called for the women and equalities minister to sit at cabinet level, hold regular interdepartmental meetings, and genuinely engage with the sector to create a new VAWG strategy. Everyone needs to be invested, argues Andrea Simon, the director of EVAW. \u201cEveryone has to have ownership of this agenda and we need to push all together to make it happen,\u201d she says. \u2022 In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

      "body": "<p>In early August 2022, Biyi B\u00e1nd\u00e9l\u00e9 had a conversation with his editor, Hannah Chukwu, about the novel he was working on, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/yoruba-boy-running-9780241562697/\">Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Boy Running</a>, after which he sent her a revised version of the manuscript. On the following day, the 54-year-old film-maker, playwright and novelist took his own life, leaving behind an impressive and strikingly varied body of work: the film adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/25/nigerian-censors-halt-civil-war-film\">Half of a Yellow Sun</a>, which took seven years to make; stage versions of Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart, Aphra Behn\u2019s Oroonoko and Lorca\u2019s Yerma; poetry, screenplays and several novels including 2007\u2019s Burma Boy, which told the story of his father\u2019s harrowing and brutal experiences as a British army soldier in the second world war. His was a talent unrestrained by genre, medium, geography or period.</p>    <p>Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Boy Running tells the story of Samuel \u00c0j\u00e0y\u00ed Crowther, whose life spanned the 19th century and took him from abduction and enslavement, via abandonment in Sierra Leone, back to Nigeria and a life in the clergy that ended with him becoming the first black bishop to be ordained by the Anglican church. In his foreword to the book, the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, whose play Death and the King\u2019s Horseman was B\u00e1nd\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s final film adaptation, points to the intensely imaginative and vivid approach the novelist took to his subject. His \u201cmix of the anecdotal, archival and inquisitional\u201d style parts company, says Soyinka, with \u201cthe slave narratives to which we are more accustomed. It disorientates, yet inducts one, at a most primary level of intimacy, and even self-identification, into the realities of capture, enslavement and displacement; eases one deftly into a milieu of the slaving occupation as an existential norm, and one that was near inextricably intertwined with the trajectory of colonialism in west Africa.\u201d</p> <p>The actor and novelist Paterson Joseph first encountered B\u00e1nd\u00e9l\u00e9 when he was cast as the lead character, Busi, in B\u00e1nd\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s 1993 television play Not Even God Is Wise Enough, which was directed by Danny Boyle. Busi is \u201ca sort of Billy Liar figure\u201d, explains Joseph, in and out of trouble and taking refuge in a fantasy life. \u201cThose stories that we went through, and the world that he inhabits, is a world of the absurd, which was very surprising when you think about 1993, how few black protagonists we had on British television that weren\u2019t cliched in some way. This character had a real sadness about him and yet he was very, very funny because of his bewilderment about the world. He\u2019s a man in search of his father, in basic terms, and he\u2019s also a boy, really, in search of himself.\u201d Joseph recalls a scene in which Busi is in a subterranean public lavatory and, apparently, encounters Dr Livingstone; another in a courtroom, where he wanders across the lawyers\u2019 benches. \u201cThere\u2019s something about his writing,\u201d says Joseph. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of maverick: it knows the rules, but it wants to disobey the rules to see what happens.\u201d</p>    <p>B\u00e1nd\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s daughter Temi is an artist who has just graduated with a first from Ruskin College in Oxford. Part of her portfolio, she and her mother, the producer Andrea Calderwood, tell me, is a steel sculpture called \u201cAjebutter\u201d, a Nigerian expression for a child who\u2019s slightly spoiled. Laughing, Calderwood remembers B\u00e1nd\u00e9l\u00e9 warning her against putting butter in Temi\u2019s food when she was being weaned lest she turn into an ajebutter. She also recalls the couple bringing a just-born Temi on to the red carpet at Cannes when one of Andrea\u2019s films was featured at the festival: \u201cPeople still ask me, \u2018How\u2019s the baby?\u2019 Such a strong image of Temi there in her pouch. I say, \u2018She\u2019s 22.\u2019 That\u2019s how people remember us. But it didn\u2019t really cross our minds that that was an unusual thing to do, to take Temi with us. For me, it was fantastic. Biyi really encouraged me to be brave about that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/oct/03/biyi-bandele-obituary\">Biyi Bandele obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Temi recalls her father exhorting her to read, watch and listen from as wide a cultural palette as possible from a very young age.

The play that changed nearly everything for me was his adaptation of Aphra Behn [in 1999]. That was a perfect combination of dramaturgical rigor and poetic heart, at a time where we were not used to all of those things coming out of a black mind.

The same weekend, individuals holding signs that said: \u201cHaitians Have No Home Here\u201d in English and Haitian Creole were seen outside Springfield\u2019s city hall offices. And in another incident, a volunteer with the Clark county Democratic party was verbally threatened by a group of Proud Boys members last month, according to a report by the Dayton Daily News. Proud Boys is a far-right group that, according to Reuters, has re-emerged in recent months as \u201cunofficial protectors of ex-president Donald Trump\u201d. That followed a group called the Israel United in Christ, a hate group as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center, holding a large public gathering in south Springfield on 21 September.

      "body": "<p>Within the oak-panelled walls and glass display cases of the Enlightenment Gallery of the British Museum \u2013 a long, impossibly high-ceilinged room that is a temple to the gods of reason and imperialism \u2013 there is a little unmarked secret door, leading backstage or who knows where. You would never spot it unless you were looking. But for the rest of the autumn \u2013 for the first time in its 200-year history \u2013 that door will be symbolically flung open and three raucous figures will be emerging from it, invading the hushed space of marble busts and dinosaur fossils and leather-bound books. Leading the charge will be a young child of indeterminate heritage, in rags and patches, calling the others on.</p> <p>The figures emerge not only from the secret door but from the imagination of the artist Hew Locke, who was recently sitting with me on a low leather seat nearby, one quiet early morning before the museum opened, explaining, with half a smile, how it will look. \u201cThere are three figures but the sense is that this is just the advance guard, there are hundreds more behind, you know, like a <em>horde</em>,\u201d he says. \u201cThe child is holding a medal, an enlargement of a medal that was given to soldiers in east and west Africa, to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_Expedition_of_1897\">Benin expedition</a> guys [who plundered that country\u2019s riches]. And he has a little armband with a very crude plastic replica of the Koh-i-noor diamond. It\u2019s a mix-up, a messing around with colonial history, a messing around with ideas of the collection here.\u201d</p>    <p>Locke turns 65 today, 13 October. A tall man, with a straggly mutton-chop beard and wise eyes, he has waited a working lifetime to do a bit of that mixing up. Born in Edinburgh to a black Guyanese father \u2013 the sculptor <a href=\"https://www.donaldlocke.com/\">Donald Locke</a> \u2013 and the white British painter Leila Locke, he spent his formative years in his father\u2019s newly independent homeland before returning to the UK to study. When he arrived back here in the early 1980s he would, he says, often wander the rooms of the British Museum, \u201cdoing my thinking\u201d \u2013 a habit that is nicely summed up in the title of his forthcoming revolutionary exhibition at the mother of all museums: what have we here?</p> <p>\u201cI have been coming here for decades and decades,\u201d he says, in a voice that still carries the leisurely cadences of Georgetown, Guyana. \u201cI would find a place that was less crowded and just walk around and make up stories for my work, have ideas, forget ideas, imagine stuff, destroy plans, and somehow \u2013 through that process \u2013 something would stick.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve always found that whole concept of enlightenment interesting. Because these people weren\u2019t very enlightened</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What sort of thing was he thinking back then?</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t really evolved my ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I grew up in a post-colonial society. I saw Guyana being created. I saw banknotes being created. I arrived just in time for independence, and knew what had been there before. But then coming to London, I realised that although we [Guyanese] knew all about this place, this place didn\u2019t know anything about us. And that was quite a shock, the lack of a two-way&nbsp;thing.\u201d</p> <p>The stately marble halls of the British Museum, engine room of modern western civilisation, crystallised that thinking. Locke remembers a few formative realisations. Here\u2019s one: why is Egypt never described as being in Africa? \u201cA simple thing like that. The answer, I guess, is because they wanted Africa to mean something different. And then you realise the fact that some of the Egyptian Pharaohs were Nubian, they were black men. And then after that, well, everything is up for questioning.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/galleries/enlightenment?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsJO4BhDoARIsADDv4vDLjLKszgnoTuZIIJtlyBsVnhTpMX1Timvs8-Y5Ogi5voI8EYccYZ8aAmLcEALw_wcB\">Enlightenment Gallery</a>, designed by Sir Robert Smirke in the 1820s, originally housed the library of the recently deceased King George III. It was conceived as the physical embodiment of the age of reason, the place where aristocratic British collectors dramatised their hierarchical view of the world and of human history, with themselves \u2013 natch \u2013 at the apex, in marble, on plinths. The museum\u2019s collection of objects began with the bequest of Sir Hans Sloane. His interest in bringing home treasures and curiosities from Indigenous communities and the classical world began when he worked as a physician on Jamaican slave plantations, the riches from which fuelled his compulsive collecting. A marble bust of Sloane \u2013 lately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/30/it-is-not-hans-sloane-who-has-been-erased-from-history-but-his-slaves\">removed from</a> its pedestal and housed in a cabinet \u2013 looks down on me and Locke as we are talking.</p> <p>\u201cThe Enlightenment room is acting as a bit of a trailer for the rest of my show,\u201d says Locke. \u201cIt is a very important place \u2013 <em>obviously</em> \u2013 but seriously lacking in <em>colour</em>. And I\u2019ve always found that whole concept of enlightenment,\u201d he stretches the word out, sceptically, \u201cshall we say, interesting. Because these people weren\u2019t very enlightened, or only narrowly enlightened.\u201d</p>    <p>It goes without saying, I suggest, that in every sense they saw the world in terms of black and (unblemished) white?</p> <p>\u201cThey did. I wrote a thesis back in the 1990s about how different the world we live in might be if all the original colourful paint had remained on Greek and Roman statues.\u201d It\u2019s funny, he suggests, that people are still so shocked by the idea that those white marble busts and figures of the <a href=\"https://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/en/multimedia/colours-frieze#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20the,its%20sculptures%20were%20also%20painted.\">Parthenon</a> marbles (otherwise known as the Elgin marbles), for example \u2013 were coloured in. \u201cThey just won\u2019t accept it no matter how you try to sell it.\u201d</p> <p>One ambition of Locke\u2019s is to bring some of that colour back into the museum \u2013 not least the range of skin tones that classical statuary once embodied. His exhibition will be, you might say, something of a sequel, or endpoint, to the triumphant and carnivalesque figures in <em>The Procession</em>, which memorably weaved their way through Tate Britain two years ago (described in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/27/hew-locke-the-procession-review-human-history-in-all-its-variety\">five-star review</a> by Laura Cumming as \u201ca tremendous spectacle \u2026 and most profound endeavour\u201d).

How complicit is the viewer in this place? Who is looking at who?\u201d</p> <p>To create the exhibition, Locke and his partner, studio curator Indra Khanna, have been visiting the British Museum for more than two years, examining objects in the stores, working closely with more than 20 specialist curators. When I ask him if he had full access to the museum\u2019s vast underground vaults, he laughs.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a story,\u201d he says. Three months after he began, headlines about the museum\u2019s Greek and Roman antiquities curator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/17/british-museum-employee-sacked-over-missing-items-was-senior-curator\">Peter Higgs</a> emerged, reporting his arrest for allegedly stealing more than 1,000 precious objects from those stores over a 30-year period, and putting some for sale on eBay. (Higgs, who maintains his innocence, is being sued by the museum over the loss of the objects.) \u201cConversations about the collection kicked into a pretty high gear then,\u201d recalls Locke. \u201cAnd security too. I was like: OK, what did I agree to here?\u201d</p> <p>That change of context didn\u2019t stop him fossicking. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d think, bloody hell, we\u2019ve got to have that,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, this Portuguese cannon, seized in Benin. A strangely beautiful thing&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u201d Locke has created evocative clusters of objects, inviting connections about empire and power. Many of the 100 or more items he has brought out from the back rooms were suggestions from curators, he says, who knew how their stories or provenance chimed with his desire to \u201cpick at the scab\u201d of where things came from, and how, and why. \u201cThey were all: \u2018Have you seen this?\u2019 \u2013 and there were some difficult stories, not all happy, joy, joy. Not at all.\u201d</p>    <p>One good example of the complicated history of some objects is the <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1896-0727-1\">Asante Ewer</a>, a bronze jug made for Richard II in the 1390s, which at some unknown point in the subsequent years of Gold Coast trade and slavery ended up as a sacred object in the royal palace in Kumasi (in present-day Ghana) before being looted and brought home by imperial British troops in&nbsp;1896.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a thing,\u201d says Locke, in passing, \u201cto be doing a show in this place, where you openly use the words loot and looting in the description of certain objects. Because you can\u2019t hide it any more.\u201d</p> <p>Featuring four overlapping themes \u2013 sovereigns and icons of nationhood, trade, conflict and treasure \u2013 the exhibition offers visitors their own choice of route through it. His intention is to make what once seemed set in stone feel more provisional. \u201cThe whole exhibition,\u201d he says, \u201cis designed to look in part like it\u2019s a series of packing crates, alluding to storage, to transport.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m reminded of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/22/hew-locke-artist-interview-artist-and-empire-tate-britain\">last time I met Locke</a>, back in 2015 in his south London studio, when he was preparing for a New York show loosely themed around migration, and was surrounded by a homemade flotilla of large improvised wooden boats, which were a kind of emotional imperative: the first, a replica of the imperial barge of the maharajah of Jaipur, he had made for his degree show at the Royal College of Art. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d he said then, \u201cGuyana means \u2018land of many waters\u2019 \u2013 you are constantly aware of boats. I went to Guyana as a five-year-old kid on a boat. I came back here on a boat. I went to Falmouth to study art based on the fact that it looked like something I knew. Every three years I would need, psychologically, to make a boat. You can\u2019t say why one thing means something to you. It\u2019s that mix of politics and the personal that you are looking for, so that it flows in and out.\u201d</p> <p>He has subsequently channelled that internalised ebb and flow \u2013 the trade routes by which objects and people have travelled \u2013 in resonant ways. The current show will feature, for example, Locke\u2019s Souvenir series: reworked 19th-century mass-produced busts of figures from the British royal family, decorated by him with the paraphernalia of imperial rule, embroidery and jewels but also replicas of medals, coins and other souvenirs of overseas&nbsp;conflict.</p>    <p>Did he, I wonder, start with a kind of disruptive wishlist at the museum?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a limit to what you can do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t gut the Duveen Gallery and take out all the Elgin marbles and show it as it could be if \u2013 and when \u2013 they go back to Greece.\u201d</p> <p>Were there frustrations?</p> <p>\u201cYou start with, like, how far can I push these guys?\u201d he says. \u201cFrom the institution\u2019s point of view, their reputation is on the line; and from my point of view, my reputation is on the line.\u201d</p> <p>Locke\u2019s intervention at the museum comes at a critical time in these debates over provenance and ethics and ownership.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in a different world to the pre-pandemic world,\u201d he suggests. \u201cPre-pandemic, everybody tried to talk a good game about decolonising the museum and stuff like that. Since the pandemic and Black Lives Matter, people think: \u2018Well, hang on, we have to put our money where our mouth is.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Locke\u2019s exhibition is the first under the stewardship of the museum\u2019s new director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/28/nicholas-cullinan-energetic-leader-british-museum-overhaul\">Nicholas Cullinan</a> \u2013 who recently oversaw the inspired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/25/national-portrait-gallery-reopening-review-a-magnificent-reinvention\">revamp</a> of the National Portrait Gallery \u2013 and who has spoken of how \u201cthis universal museum is not [yet] universal enough\u201d. Cullinan has inherited the show, so is he fully on board with all its themes?</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t completely had that type of conversation,\u201d says Locke. \u201cBut we have bonded on certain things, for sure.\u201d He agrees that it marks more than a moment; it is the beginning of irreversible re-evaluation. \u201cAnd to be fair, despite my critiques of institutions like this over the years, it\u2019s a brave thing to do, because you are not quite sure where it\u2019s going to end&nbsp;up.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you\u2019re invading a country or taking over a civilisation, you want all the gold you can grab. You\u2019re not really concerned about what this means culturally</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By way of example, he points to the Ta\u00edno carvings \u2013 15th-century wooden sculptures from Jamaica of which the British Museum holds nine examples. \u201cFor Jamaica this is the Elgin marbles, you know, they want them back. There are lots of debates that will be had in the&nbsp;future.\u201d</p> <p>One of his aims is to give a sense of the sheer volume of such treasure that the museum holds from the former pink parts of the globe, much of it never on display.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted the show to feel full of stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t become an academic exercise aesthetically.\u201d Locke deconstructs the idea that the museum is orderly and academic as a post-rationalisation of the looting it partly represents. \u201cIf you work here, you obviously love the objects \u2013 but the way you display certain things, like a display of gold coins or something like that, is <em>restrained</em>. It wouldn\u2019t be, let\u2019s have 500 of them \u2013 that\u2019s more an artistic approach. But when you\u2019re invading a country or taking over a civilisation, shall we say, you definitely want <em>plenty</em>. You want all the gold you can grab. You\u2019re not really concerned about what this means, culturally or whatever \u2013 bollocks to that.\u201d</p> <p>He recalls his partner, Khanna, talking about watching <em>Antiques Roadshow</em>. \u201cPeople would always be saying, oh, I went up into the attic and I found this thing that great-uncle so-and-so picked up in this colony. And the antiques expert would say this is a wonderful example of this or that. And then it goes into auction, bish, bosh, done. I don\u2019t think you can do that any more. These days, the first thing people might think is, where did it come from? That question is going to be asked more and more.\u201d</p>    <p>I remember talking to former British Museum director Neil MacGregor about these issues ages ago, I say, and his argument, broadly, was that the museum was the world\u2019s memory bank, the place where people from the world\u2019s four corners make connections about shared history. Is what he is doing another expression of that idea?</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom a museological point of view, this could be seen as the world\u2019s problem. You can ignore it. You can bury your head in the sand. But as soon as you start looking and thinking, the whole thing becomes highly political. I was on holiday last year in Athens and went to visit the Parthenon Gallery. I was walking around thinking: \u2018Shit, this is the most political museum I\u2019ve ever been in.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In what sense?</p> <p>\u201cThere were all these casts of the Elgin marbles interspersed with the odd few they managed to hang on to. My wife was walking behind this American tour group and she heard someone say, \u2018God, what must it be like to be British walking around here? Imagine the guilt.\u2019 But that\u2019s the same for any encyclopedic museum in Europe or America. There are certain things you expect to see, and now all those things are problematic. What do you do? If I was a young lawyer, I\u2019d be thinking, \u2018Boy, let me go into property law of this nature, there is going to be work for me for a long time.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Against that complication, I suggest, it\u2019s clear that he wants his exhibition to be exuberant rather than preachy or earnest?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a miserable show,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt all my life artistically with these kinds of difficult things, but we can\u2019t live in misery. Hence my work looks the way it looks. Life is tough enough.\u201d</p> <p>Then again, if Hew Locke was in charge, would he be sending, for example, the controversial Benin bronzes back home tomorrow?</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t not send them back. Accepting the fact that I\u2019d be sad to see them go, because I can get on a bus and come down here. My mother told me about those bronzes when I was a child. In Guyana, in 1969, that was a very unusual thing for somebody to be talking about.\u201d</p> <p>And would he accept the fact that if they did go back, far fewer people would ever get to see&nbsp;them?</p>    <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the debate that people often bring up. But then the thing is, would it not be a boost to tourism in Benin? I heard of a group in the US, radical activists, an African-American group, saying, well, these things should stay here, because this stuff is what was used to trade us into slavery. So there are all sorts of arguments and debates. But the thing is, if it was down to me, I\u2019d be giving them back.\u201d</p> <p>Did he ever think he would see the day when statues of slave traders, say, ended up in the bottom of harbours?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember driving through Bristol with a friend back in the 80s, and as we went past the statue of Edward Colston, I said casually: \u2018That\u2019s got to go.\u2019 But when it came down I was in shock. It\u2019s the same thing in this building. Certain things feel like a fixture, sure. Some of them are literally almost immovable, but they have been moved before.\u201d</p> <p>He recognises, of course, that a lot of people who feel threatened by that knowledge \u2013 the sense that culture is an ongoing argument, not something set in stone \u2013 would defend \u201cour heritage\u201d at all costs and might fear the implied message of his exhibition. What, I wonder, does he say to them?</p> <p>He smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t panic!\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that if you give certain things away, you won\u2019t notice it. But at the same time, there\u2019s lots more stuff here, and wonderful, sharp curators. Things will change, you know?\u201d He gestures around the Enlightenment Gallery. \u201cThis may look different in 20 years\u2019 time. But that\u2019s how the world&nbsp;works.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/hew-locke-what-have-we-here\">Hew Locke: what have we here? is at the British Museum, London, from Thursday 17 October to 9&nbsp;February 2025</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Within the oak-panelled walls and glass display cases of the Enlightenment Gallery of the British Museum \u2013 a long, impossibly high-ceilinged room that is a temple to the gods of reason and imperialism \u2013 there is a little unmarked secret door, leading backstage or who knows where. You would never spot it unless you were looking. But for the rest of the autumn \u2013 for the first time in its 200-year history \u2013 that door will be symbolically flung open and three raucous figures will be emerging from it, invading the hushed space of marble busts and dinosaur fossils and leather-bound books. Leading the charge will be a young child of indeterminate heritage, in rags and patches, calling the others on. The figures emerge not only from the secret door but from the imagination of the artist Hew Locke, who was recently sitting with me on a low leather seat nearby, one quiet early morning before the museum opened, explaining, with half a smile, how it will look. \u201cThere are three figures but the sense is that this is just the advance guard, there are hundreds more behind, you know, like a horde,\u201d he says. \u201cThe child is holding a medal, an enlargement of a medal that was given to soldiers in east and west Africa, to the Benin expedition guys [who plundered that country\u2019s riches]. And he has a little armband with a very crude plastic replica of the Koh-i-noor diamond. It\u2019s a mix-up, a messing around with colonial history, a messing around with ideas of the collection here.\u201d Locke turns 65 today, 13 October. A tall man, with a straggly mutton-chop beard and wise eyes, he has waited a working lifetime to do a bit of that mixing up. Born in Edinburgh to a black Guyanese father \u2013 the sculptor Donald Locke \u2013 and the white British painter Leila Locke, he spent his formative years in his father\u2019s newly independent homeland before returning to the UK to study. When he arrived back here in the early 1980s he would, he says, often wander the rooms of the British Museum, \u201cdoing my thinking\u201d \u2013 a habit that is nicely summed up in the title of his forthcoming revolutionary exhibition at the mother of all museums: what have we here? \u201cI have been coming here for decades and decades,\u201d he says, in a voice that still carries the leisurely cadences of Georgetown, Guyana. \u201cI would find a place that was less crowded and just walk around and make up stories for my work, have ideas, forget ideas, imagine stuff, destroy plans, and somehow \u2013 through that process \u2013 something would stick.\u201d What sort of thing was he thinking back then? \u201cI hadn\u2019t really evolved my ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I grew up in a post-colonial society. I saw Guyana being created. I saw banknotes being created. I arrived just in time for independence, and knew what had been there before. But then coming to London, I realised that although we [Guyanese] knew all about this place, this place didn\u2019t know anything about us. And that was quite a shock, the lack of a two-way thing.\u201d The stately marble halls of the British Museum, engine room of modern western civilisation, crystallised that thinking. Locke remembers a few formative realisations. Here\u2019s one: why is Egypt never described as being in Africa? \u201cA simple thing like that. The answer, I guess, is because they wanted Africa to mean something different. And then you realise the fact that some of the Egyptian Pharaohs were Nubian, they were black men. And then after that, well, everything is up for questioning.\u201d The Enlightenment Gallery, designed by Sir Robert Smirke in the 1820s, originally housed the library of the recently deceased King George III. It was conceived as the physical embodiment of the age of reason, the place where aristocratic British collectors dramatised their hierarchical view of the world and of human history, with themselves \u2013 natch \u2013 at the apex, in marble, on plinths. The museum\u2019s collection of objects began with the bequest of Sir Hans Sloane. His interest in bringing home treasures and curiosities from Indigenous communities and the classical world began when he worked as a physician on Jamaican slave plantations, the riches from which fuelled his compulsive collecting. A marble bust of Sloane \u2013 lately removed from its pedestal and housed in a cabinet \u2013 looks down on me and Locke as we are talking. \u201cThe Enlightenment room is acting as a bit of a trailer for the rest of my show,\u201d says Locke. \u201cIt is a very important place \u2013 obviously \u2013 but seriously lacking in colour. And I\u2019ve always found that whole concept of enlightenment,\u201d he stretches the word out, sceptically, \u201cshall we say, interesting. Because these people weren\u2019t very enlightened, or only narrowly enlightened.\u201d It goes without saying, I suggest, that in every sense they saw the world in terms of black and (unblemished) white? \u201cThey did. I wrote a thesis back in the 1990s about how different the world we live in might be if all the original colourful paint had remained on Greek and Roman statues.\u201d It\u2019s funny, he suggests, that people are still so shocked by the idea that those white marble busts and figures of the Parthenon marbles (otherwise known as the Elgin marbles), for example \u2013 were coloured in. \u201cThey just won\u2019t accept it no matter how you try to sell it.\u201d One ambition of Locke\u2019s is to bring some of that colour back into the museum \u2013 not least the range of skin tones that classical statuary once embodied. His exhibition will be, you might say, something of a sequel, or endpoint, to the triumphant and carnivalesque figures in The Procession, which memorably weaved their way through Tate Britain two years ago (described in a five-star review by Laura Cumming as \u201ca tremendous spectacle \u2026 and most profound endeavour\u201d). In the process by which galleries and museums re-evaluate the colonial roots of their collections and thinking, Locke has become something of a Prospero figure, magicking up the stuff that dreams \u2013 and nightmares \u2013 of empire were made of. Key to the new show will be a series of 11 oversized sculptural figures called The Watchers, who will perch in the fabric of the museum, observing visitors as they wander. \u201cYou\u2019ll see them on top of the shelves and so on,\u201d says Locke. \u201cThey\u2019re watching your reaction, sometimes pointing at you, maybe judging you \u2013 or are they judging you? How complicit is the viewer in this place? Who is looking at who?\u201d To create the exhibition, Locke and his partner, studio curator Indra Khanna, have been visiting the British Museum for more than two years, examining objects in the stores, working closely with more than 20 specialist curators. When I ask him if he had full access to the museum\u2019s vast underground vaults, he laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s a story,\u201d he says. Three months after he began, headlines about the museum\u2019s Greek and Roman antiquities curator Peter Higgs emerged, reporting his arrest for allegedly stealing more than 1,000 precious objects from those stores over a 30-year period, and putting some for sale on eBay. (Higgs, who maintains his innocence, is being sued by the museum over the loss of the objects.) \u201cConversations about the collection kicked into a pretty high gear then,\u201d recalls Locke. \u201cAnd security too. I was like: OK, what did I agree to here?\u201d That change of context didn\u2019t stop him fossicking. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d think, bloody hell, we\u2019ve got to have that,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, this Portuguese cannon, seized in Benin. A strangely beautiful thing \u2026 \u201d Locke has created evocative clusters of objects, inviting connections about empire and power. Many of the 100 or more items he has brought out from the back rooms were suggestions from curators, he says, who knew how their stories or provenance chimed with his desire to \u201cpick at the scab\u201d of where things came from, and how, and why. \u201cThey were all: \u2018Have you seen this?\u2019 \u2013 and there were some difficult stories, not all happy, joy, joy. Not at all.\u201d One good example of the complicated history of some objects is the Asante Ewer, a bronze jug made for Richard II in the 1390s, which at some unknown point in the subsequent years of Gold Coast trade and slavery ended up as a sacred object in the royal palace in Kumasi (in present-day Ghana) before being looted and brought home by imperial British troops in 1896. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a thing,\u201d says Locke, in passing, \u201cto be doing a show in this place, where you openly use the words loot and looting in the description of certain objects. Because you can\u2019t hide it any more.\u201d Featuring four overlapping themes \u2013 sovereigns and icons of nationhood, trade, conflict and treasure \u2013 the exhibition offers visitors their own choice of route through it. His intention is to make what once seemed set in stone feel more provisional. \u201cThe whole exhibition,\u201d he says, \u201cis designed to look in part like it\u2019s a series of packing crates, alluding to storage, to transport.\u201d I\u2019m reminded of the last time I met Locke, back in 2015 in his south London studio, when he was preparing for a New York show loosely themed around migration, and was surrounded by a homemade flotilla of large improvised wooden boats, which were a kind of emotional imperative: the first, a replica of the imperial barge of the maharajah of Jaipur, he had made for his degree show at the Royal College of Art. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d he said then, \u201cGuyana means \u2018land of many waters\u2019 \u2013 you are constantly aware of boats.

Did he, I wonder, start with a kind of disruptive wishlist at the museum? \u201cThere\u2019s a limit to what you can do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t gut the Duveen Gallery and take out all the Elgin marbles and show it as it could be if \u2013 and when \u2013 they go back to Greece.\u201d Were there frustrations? \u201cYou start with, like, how far can I push these guys?\u201d he says. \u201cFrom the institution\u2019s point of view, their reputation is on the line; and from my point of view, my reputation is on the line.\u201d Locke\u2019s intervention at the museum comes at a critical time in these debates over provenance and ethics and ownership. \u201cWe live in a different world to the pre-pandemic world,\u201d he suggests. \u201cPre-pandemic, everybody tried to talk a good game about decolonising the museum and stuff like that. Since the pandemic and Black Lives Matter, people think: \u2018Well, hang on, we have to put our money where our mouth is.\u2019\u201d Locke\u2019s exhibition is the first under the stewardship of the museum\u2019s new director Nicholas Cullinan \u2013 who recently oversaw the inspired revamp of the National Portrait Gallery \u2013 and who has spoken of how \u201cthis universal museum is not [yet] universal enough\u201d. Cullinan has inherited the show, so is he fully on board with all its themes? \u201cWe haven\u2019t completely had that type of conversation,\u201d says Locke. \u201cBut we have bonded on certain things, for sure.\u201d He agrees that it marks more than a moment; it is the beginning of irreversible re-evaluation. \u201cAnd to be fair, despite my critiques of institutions like this over the years, it\u2019s a brave thing to do, because you are not quite sure where it\u2019s going to end up.\u201d By way of example, he points to the Ta\u00edno carvings \u2013 15th-century wooden sculptures from Jamaica of which the British Museum holds nine examples. \u201cFor Jamaica this is the Elgin marbles, you know, they want them back. There are lots of debates that will be had in the future.\u201d One of his aims is to give a sense of the sheer volume of such treasure that the museum holds from the former pink parts of the globe, much of it never on display. \u201cI wanted the show to feel full of stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t become an academic exercise aesthetically.\u201d Locke deconstructs the idea that the museum is orderly and academic as a post-rationalisation of the looting it partly represents. \u201cIf you work here, you obviously love the objects \u2013 but the way you display certain things, like a display of gold coins or something like that, is restrained. It wouldn\u2019t be, let\u2019s have 500 of them \u2013 that\u2019s more an artistic approach. But when you\u2019re invading a country or taking over a civilisation, shall we say, you definitely want plenty. You want all the gold you can grab. You\u2019re not really concerned about what this means, culturally or whatever \u2013 bollocks to that.\u201d He recalls his partner, Khanna, talking about watching Antiques Roadshow. \u201cPeople would always be saying, oh, I went up into the attic and I found this thing that great-uncle so-and-so picked up in this colony. And the antiques expert would say this is a wonderful example of this or that. And then it goes into auction, bish, bosh, done. I don\u2019t think you can do that any more. These days, the first thing people might think is, where did it come from? That question is going to be asked more and more.\u201d I remember talking to former British Museum director Neil MacGregor about these issues ages ago, I say, and his argument, broadly, was that the museum was the world\u2019s memory bank, the place where people from the world\u2019s four corners make connections about shared history. Is what he is doing another expression of that idea? \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom a museological point of view, this could be seen as the world\u2019s problem. You can ignore it. You can bury your head in the sand. But as soon as you start looking and thinking, the whole thing becomes highly political. I was on holiday last year in Athens and went to visit the Parthenon Gallery. I was walking around thinking: \u2018Shit, this is the most political museum I\u2019ve ever been in.\u2019\u201d In what sense? \u201cThere were all these casts of the Elgin marbles interspersed with the odd few they managed to hang on to. My wife was walking behind this American tour group and she heard someone say, \u2018God, what must it be like to be British walking around here? Imagine the guilt.\u2019 But that\u2019s the same for any encyclopedic museum in Europe or America. There are certain things you expect to see, and now all those things are problematic. What do you do? If I was a young lawyer, I\u2019d be thinking, \u2018Boy, let me go into property law of this nature, there is going to be work for me for a long time.\u2019\u201d Against that complication, I suggest, it\u2019s clear that he wants his exhibition to be exuberant rather than preachy or earnest? \u201cIt\u2019s not a miserable show,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt all my life artistically with these kinds of difficult things, but we can\u2019t live in misery. Hence my work looks the way it looks. Life is tough enough.\u201d Then again, if Hew Locke was in charge, would he be sending, for example, the controversial Benin bronzes back home tomorrow? \u201cI can\u2019t not send them back. Accepting the fact that I\u2019d be sad to see them go, because I can get on a bus and come down here. My mother told me about those bronzes when I was a child. In Guyana, in 1969, that was a very unusual thing for somebody to be talking about.\u201d And would he accept the fact that if they did go back, far fewer people would ever get to see them? \u201cThat\u2019s the debate that people often bring up. But then the thing is, would it not be a boost to tourism in Benin? I heard of a group in the US, radical activists, an African-American group, saying, well, these things should stay here, because this stuff is what was used to trade us into slavery. So there are all sorts of arguments and debates. But the thing is, if it was down to me, I\u2019d be giving them back.\u201d Did he ever think he would see the day when statues of slave traders, say, ended up in the bottom of harbours? \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember driving through Bristol with a friend back in the 80s, and as we went past the statue of Edward Colston, I said casually: \u2018That\u2019s got to go.\u2019 But when it came down I was in shock. It\u2019s the same thing in this building. Certain things feel like a fixture, sure. Some of them are literally almost immovable, but they have been moved before.\u201d He recognises, of course, that a lot of people who feel threatened by that knowledge \u2013 the sense that culture is an ongoing argument, not something set in stone \u2013 would defend \u201cour heritage\u201d at all costs and might fear the implied message of his exhibition. What, I wonder, does he say to them? He smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t panic!\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that if you give certain things away, you won\u2019t notice it. But at the same time, there\u2019s lots more stuff here, and wonderful, sharp curators. Things will change, you know?\u201d He gestures around the Enlightenment Gallery. \u201cThis may look different in 20 years\u2019 time. But that\u2019s how the world works.\u201d Hew Locke: what have we here? is at the British Museum, London, from Thursday 17 October to 9 February 2025",

Local authorities have also complained that targets under the proposed new national planning policy framework (NPPF) for England are sometimes totally unrealistic, both in terms of what can be built and, in some cases, the amount of homes needed. It follows earlier concerns that the wording of the NPPF, which is being consulted on, could result in large expanses of pristine green belt being built over so councils can reach their targets. The leaders of every political group on one council, including Labour, have written jointly to Angela Rayner warning that councils are \u201cbeing set up to fail\u201d with a planning framework based on an overly simplistic view of the housing market. Under the NPPF, set out in July with a blueprint to deliver 1.5m homes this parliament, all regions apart from London must plan for thousands more homes. Councils that fail to deliver could risk penalties or even a takeover by ministers. The joint letter to Rayner, the housing secretary, by Arun district council in West Sussex says the authority has approved more than 8,000 planning permissions that have not been built by developers, and that simply adding new numbers to a target will not alter this. \u201cThe proposed NPPF changes appear to rest on the premise that the planning system is solely responsible for the shortfall in housing delivery and thus continue to penalise councils for missing housing targets,\u201d it reads. \u201cThis is simply not true.\u201d Martin Lury, the Liberal Democrat leader of the council, who signed the letter with the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, Greens and two independent groups, said that while they all recognised the need for new homes, local infrastructure was \u201ccracking at the seams\u201d, and available land was limited by the South Downs national park and flood plains. \u201cThe message is: stop penalising us for things that are beyond our control.

The Lib Dem-led council said the plan was \u201csimply unachievable\u201d in an area where building was heavily constrained by the Surrey Hills national landscape \u2013 the new term for an area of outstanding natural beauty \u2013 and that the planned new housing far exceeded projections for local population growth.

Haigh then added in an interview that she was boycotting the company and had encouraged her department not to deal with it.</p> <p>With DP World threatening to cancel a planned \u00a31bn investment in the UK, Keir Starmer said Haigh\u2019s comments did not reflect the official government position \u2013 a stance echoed by Reynolds on Sunday morning.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the government\u2019s position,\u201d Reynolds told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. \u201cI\u2019m happy to clarify that I speak for the government on business issues. As a business secretary, we will always make clear what happened [in 2022] was wrong. That\u2019s why we\u2019re changing the law to make sure it can\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p> <p>He called the mass firing by P&amp;O \u201ca particularly egregious case\u201d. But he added: \u201cWhere companies accept that we\u2019re not allowing that to happen any more, and we can work with them on investments into the country, we can have a conversation with them, we will do so. It\u2019s not the government\u2019s position to boycott them.\u201d</p> <p>Allies of Haigh said she had not been told that DP World was planning to attend the event, nor that it was preparing to make a major investment in the UK, before she made her comments. They added that the press release referring to P&amp;O had been signed off by Downing Street, and they alleged she had subsequently been \u201chung out to dry\u201d by people in No 10.</p> <p>The prime minister attempted to patch over the cabinet rift on Saturday, calling Haigh to tell her he had full confidence in her as transport secretary.</p> <p>He is hoping that the statements he and Reynolds have made in recent days will have reassured companies planning to attend Monday\u2019s event at the Guildhall.

      "bodyText": "P&amp;O Ferries is not a rogue operator, the business secretary has said, as the government attempted to draw a line under the damaging row that has engulfed the buildup to its international investment summit on Monday. Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC on Sunday that he did not regard the company as \u201crogue\u201d, despite his cabinet colleague Louise Haigh having described it in that way earlier this week. Ministers have been in damage limitation mode since Haigh made those comments, which reflected Labour\u2019s previous position but which triggered reports that P&amp;O\u2019s parent company was threatening to pull out of Monday\u2019s summit. In an official statement, Haigh, the transport secretary, called P&amp;O a \u201crogue operator\u201d because of its decision in 2022 to sack 800 employees without notice and employ agency staff instead on lower pay. Haigh then added in an interview that she was boycotting the company and had encouraged her department not to deal with it. With DP World threatening to cancel a planned \u00a31bn investment in the UK, Keir Starmer said Haigh\u2019s comments did not reflect the official government position \u2013 a stance echoed by Reynolds on Sunday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s not the government\u2019s position,\u201d Reynolds told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. \u201cI\u2019m happy to clarify that I speak for the government on business issues. As a business secretary, we will always make clear what happened [in 2022] was wrong. That\u2019s why we\u2019re changing the law to make sure it can\u2019t happen again.\u201d He called the mass firing by P&amp;O \u201ca particularly egregious case\u201d. But he added: \u201cWhere companies accept that we\u2019re not allowing that to happen any more, and we can work with them on investments into the country, we can have a conversation with them, we will do so. It\u2019s not the government\u2019s position to boycott them.\u201d Allies of Haigh said she had not been told that DP World was planning to attend the event, nor that it was preparing to make a major investment in the UK, before she made her comments. They added that the press release referring to P&amp;O had been signed off by Downing Street, and they alleged she had subsequently been \u201chung out to dry\u201d by people in No 10. The prime minister attempted to patch over the cabinet rift on Saturday, calling Haigh to tell her he had full confidence in her as transport secretary. He is hoping that the statements he and Reynolds have made in recent days will have reassured companies planning to attend Monday\u2019s event at the Guildhall. The business department announced on Saturday that DP World would be one of those after all. About 200 senior executives are signed up to participate in the summit, as well as a string of cabinet ministers, including Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The government hopes to use the event to demonstrate its ability to attract inward investment, although many business executives have expressed concern about the summit being held before knowing the outcome of this month\u2019s budget. Charlie Nunn, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, told the BBC on Sunday that he was concerned about the impact of taxing employers\u2019 pension contributions, something Reeves is considering before her announcement on 30 October. Nunn said: \u201cAnything that helps people continue to invest and take appropriate risk, we think, is really important. Anything that does the opposite would be a handbrake.\u201d He added: \u201cPensions, and contributions to pensions, are critical. We see about 40% of people in the UK have a pension which won\u2019t give them even a basic living allowance when they retire. So we need to increase enrolment and investments in pensions.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The New Real is bookended by scenes where an onstage character invites the audience to \u201cimagine this\u201d: the world in the early years of the current century. Rachel, an esteemed American political strategist and Caro, a revered New Labour pollster, are both recruited to help win \u2013 fairly and ethically \u2013 a ruthless election in an unnamed \u201cformer Russian colony\u201d where truth is malleable and objective facts an illusion.<br><br>As a dramatic simulacrum of the past two decades of western politics, David Edgar\u2019s play explores some pressing questions where the real-world stakes could not be higher. It\u2019s unfortunate that these stakes are rarely matched by the dramatic ones. The compelling electioneering drama in the first act is more persuasive than the action in the second, where narrative questions recede and are replaced by a sequence of scenes where the dialogue frequently feels expository.<br><br>Nevertheless, the performances are often fine. Martina Laird\u2019s smart portrayal of Rachel appears particularly vital: persistently pensive and focused, her words appear to organically respond to the live moment. Jodie McNee, as Caro, similarly imbues the character with more canniness that the dialogue sometimes permits, and Lloyd Owen, as rival strategist Larry Yeates is an effective foil (even if he is inexplicably fashioned as an overtly sexy Paul Manafort).<br><br>Directed by Holly Race Roughan, the staging is brisk; a multitude of locations are swiftly evoked on Alex Lowde\u2019s traverse stage design, aided by Luke Halls\u2019 video design and particularly the uncanny and unnerving use of AI-generated images. Here, everything and everywhere appears to be almost real without ever being entirely so.<br><br>But this rhetorical straddling of the real and not-real is a problem the play never quite reconciles.

      "bodyText": "The New Real is bookended by scenes where an onstage character invites the audience to \u201cimagine this\u201d: the world in the early years of the current century. Rachel, an esteemed American political strategist and Caro, a revered New Labour pollster, are both recruited to help win \u2013 fairly and ethically \u2013 a ruthless election in an unnamed \u201cformer Russian colony\u201d where truth is malleable and objective facts an illusion. As a dramatic simulacrum of the past two decades of western politics, David Edgar\u2019s play explores some pressing questions where the real-world stakes could not be higher. It\u2019s unfortunate that these stakes are rarely matched by the dramatic ones. The compelling electioneering drama in the first act is more persuasive than the action in the second, where narrative questions recede and are replaced by a sequence of scenes where the dialogue frequently feels expository. Nevertheless, the performances are often fine. Martina Laird\u2019s smart portrayal of Rachel appears particularly vital: persistently pensive and focused, her words appear to organically respond to the live moment. Jodie McNee, as Caro, similarly imbues the character with more canniness that the dialogue sometimes permits, and Lloyd Owen, as rival strategist Larry Yeates is an effective foil (even if he is inexplicably fashioned as an overtly sexy Paul Manafort). Directed by Holly Race Roughan, the staging is brisk; a multitude of locations are swiftly evoked on Alex Lowde\u2019s traverse stage design, aided by Luke Halls\u2019 video design and particularly the uncanny and unnerving use of AI-generated images. Here, everything and everywhere appears to be almost real without ever being entirely so. But this rhetorical straddling of the real and not-real is a problem the play never quite reconciles. Had it been staged 10 years ago, one can imagine its theatricalisation of a post-truth political sphere might have felt more incisive and terrifyingly prescient. But we are where we are, and an invitation to \u201cimagine this\u201d is an irony of impossible luxury. To propose all this as ambiguous metaphor, while a very real war of Russian aggression is being waged in a real eastern European country, feels uncomfortably close to peddling alternative facts. \u2022 At The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon until 2 November",

Gelvana Aparecida Rodrigues da Silva, 37, lost her son Thiago on 5 November 2015 when the Fund\u00e3o dam, near Mariana in eastern Brazil, collapsed, releasing about 50m cubic metres of toxic waste. The avalanche of water reached the small community of Bento Rodrigues within minutes, killing 19 people, including Thiago, who had been staying with his grandmother at the time. \u201cHis grandmother said that he asked for Jesus,\u201d said Da Silva of her son\u2019s final moments. \u201cHe called for Jesus to save him.

It destroyed bridges, roads, houses, factories and other commercial premises, as well as farmland, wildlife and historic churches containing priceless artefacts. About 620,000 individuals, 46 Brazilian municipalities, 2,000 businesses and 65 faith-based institutions are to claim damages from the Anglo-Australian mining company BHP at a high court trial in London scheduled to be heard over 12 weeks, from 21 October. Tom Goodhead, the chief executive of the international law firm Pogust Goodhead, which is representing the claimants, said they will argue that BHP is liable as a 50% shareholder in Samarco, the joint venture company responsible for managing the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam. It is further claimed that BHP, who were in a joint venture with the Brazilian iron-ore mining company Vale, were negligent in that although \u201cthey were aware of the risks of the dam collapsing, they funded its expansion\u201d, Goodhead said. The claimants are seeking up to $44bn (\u00a333.6bn) in compensation. BHP, along with Vale and Samarco, established the Renova Foundation to provide compensation for individuals and some small businesses for loss and damages, as well as mitigating environmental impacts. The company said it would defend the legal action. A BHP spokesperson said: \u201cThe Fund\u00e3o dam collapse was a tragedy and our deepest sympathies remain with the impacted families and communities. \u201cThe Renova Foundation, established in 2016 as part of our agreement with the Brazilian authorities, has spent more than $7.7bn on emergency financial assistance, compensation and repair and rebuilding of environment and infrastructure to approximately 430,000 individuals, local businesses and Indigenous communities. \u201cBHP Brasil is working collectively with the Brazilian authorities and others to seek solutions to finalise a fair and comprehensive compensation and rehabilitation process that would keep funds in Brazil for the Brazilian people and environment affected, including impacted Indigenous communities. \u201cBHP continues to defend the legal action in the UK. We believe that the UK litigation, which, if successful, would not see claimants receive payment until 2028 at the earliest, duplicates \u2013 and harms \u2013 local remedial efforts in Brazil. \u201cAs a non-operating joint-venture partner in Samarco, BHP Brasil does not have operational or day-to-day control of the business.

She said: \u201cThe only thing that we are asking for is justice, for this to never happen to any other mother. No money in the world can bring my son back, but I want them to be responsible for this, for this crime.\u201d Goodhead said: \u201cTo our knowledge, this is the largest ever group action in the English courts and we believe, probably the largest anywhere in the world.

It tells the story of George (played by Elliott Heffernan), a nine-year-old mixed-race boy evacuated to the countryside for safety, who absconds to make his way back to his factory worker mother (Saoirse Ronan) in London.</p> <p>Heffernan, 11, is not the only one making his screen debut. George\u2019s grandfather is played by Paul Weller. Yes, <em>that</em> Paul Weller \u2013 the musician and self-declared Beatles/1960s obsessive known as \u201cthe Modfather\u201d, formerly of the Jam and the Style Council, and creator of 17 solo albums such as <em>Wild Wood </em>(1993), <em>Stanley Road</em> (1995), <em>On Sunset</em> (2020), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/23/paul-weller-66-album-review\">the latest, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/23/paul-weller-66-album-review\">66</a></em>, released earlier this year, the day before his 66th birthday.</p>    <p>What\u2019s more, Weller is getting glowing reviews: \u201cAn impressive debut\u201d (the<em> Times</em>); \u201cSuperb\u201d (Deadline). Such a response is by no means de rigueur for the musicians-turned-actors. After all, for every mesmeric David Bowie in 1976\u2019s <em>The Man Who Fell to Earth</em>, there\u2019s an oiled and glistening Sting strutting in what appears to be a futuristic adult nappy in David Lynch\u2019s <em>Dune</em>.</p> <p>If <em>Blitz</em> is an unexpected move for Weller, it has paid off. You can also trust the connection between him and McQueen (who also made the award-winning Black British history anthology <em>Small Axe</em>). Still, it\u2019s quite the transformation for an artist who, in a five-decade-plus music career, never showed the remotest inclination to dabble in other artforms, least of all acting. One might even say it is a quintessentially anti-Weller move.</p> <p>Or is this a lazy misreading of Weller? Is it simply that British culture\u2019s changing man has changed yet again? McQueen clearly saw something in Weller. At a press conference for <em>Blitz</em>, he said: \u201cI just thought he had an authenticity to his face. He looks like a person from that time\u201d. By email from the New York film festival, where <em>Blitz</em> was showing last week, McQueen tells me: \u201cI needed someone with a certain weight and depth.\u201d</p> <p>He says Weller prepared for the role by working with an acting coach. \u201cPaul is extra-generous in his contribution to the film. His work with Saoirse and Elliott was particularly tender.\u201d What are McQueen\u2019s thoughts on Weller generally as a cultural force? \u201cThe fact that we are still talking about him after more than 50 years tells you he is a pillar in British culture.\u201d</p>    <p>Suggs of Madness, aka Graham McPherson, a friend of Weller\u2019s since the 1970s, was in the studio with him when McQueen called. \u201cAmazing to read he\u2019s playing a grandad,\u201d he laughs over the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s dealt with being the Modfather. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to deal with being the Mod-grandfather.\u201d</p> <p>Suggs says Weller\u2019s immediate reaction was uncertainty: \u201cHe seemed confused \u2013 about whether he wanted to be an actor \u2026 He was always going on about how he hated doing videos.\u201d But he says Weller was intrigued, primarily about McQueen: \u201cHe\u2019s got some respect for that guy as a film-maker.\u201d</p> <p>Suggs was one of the artists who worked with Weller on<em> 66</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/24/paul-weller-66-review-the-modfather-holds-his-ground-with-a-little-help-from-his-friends\">which had lyric contributions from a number of artists</a>. \u201cIt was very nice working with him. People see him as being tough, but he\u2019s very easy going. A very charming, funny person. I\u2019ve always liked his attitude, his work ethic, his constant drive to change and reinvigorate himself.\u201d</p> <p>Few would deny that Weller is one of the major arteries of British music and culture. Still, looking at his trajectory, there\u2019s also a marked pattern of almost bullish restlessness.</p> <p>Born in Woking, Surrey, to taxi driver John and cleaner Ann, his late father would become his manager, while his mother ran his fanclub. As he cut his teeth in the unfashionable environs of working men\u2019s clubs, the Jam, the band he formed in 1972 with Bruce Foxton and Rick Buckler, were a suited, booted, punk-adjacent, mod-suffused clarion call to the times, pumping out songs such as Down in the Tube Station at Midnight, Going Underground, and The Eton Rifles, the track Old Etonian David Cameron said he liked.</p>    <p>Weller, not one for hanging back in the class war, responded in his signature bracing style: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps \u2026 \u2018Which bit didn\u2019t you get?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When I interviewed Weller alongside Noel Gallagher around the recording of <em>Fire &amp; Skill</em>, a 1999 album of Jam covers, Weller was similarly forthright about the politicos he\u2019d encountered during his mid-80s involvement with the Labour party youth drive Red Wedge: \u201cOnce I met the people involved, I thought, \u2018Get me out of here.\u2019 Forget showbusiness, these people had egos the size of that barn.\u201d</p> <p>Arguably, this uncompromising attitude runs through Weller\u2019s creativity. In a move that makes grown men with feather cuts weep into their beer to this day, he audaciously broke up the Jam in 1982 to form the Style Council with Mick Talbot, accompanied on vocals by Dee C Lee, who was to become his wife. Purveyors of what was termed cappuccino-soul, the Style Council (the antithesis of Little Englanders, gadding about with jumpers tied around their necks) couldn\u2019t have been further from the Jam. Likewise, when the Style Council\u2019s fifth album was rejected by Polydor in 1989, it was because it was full of house beats, with acid jazz thrown in.</p> <p>It was followed by a tough period in the wilderness for Weller (\u201cIt needed to happen,\u201d he told me bluntly; \u201cit brought me down to earth\u201d). He then went on to enjoy the fabled Modfather mid-90s solo resurgence, almost at times serving as a human junction between eras: from the black-and-white 60s music he loves (the Kinks, the Who, Small Faces, Northern Soul and US R&amp;B), through to modern innovations and styles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/26/politicians-theyre-mugs-all-of-them-paul-weller-on-music-style-and-the-state-of-the-nation\">\u2018Politicians?

      "body": "<p>The family and friends of a British IT executive who fell to her death from an apartment block in Spain on the evening of her 50th birthday have called on the Metropolitan police to intervene in a Spanish police investigation into the fatality.</p> <p>Piia Hokkanen, who at the time of her death had borrowed her sister\u2019s holiday home for a three-day mini-break in Torrevieja, near Alicante, was found lifeless after falling from a communal window on to a neighbour\u2019s patio shortly after midnight on 4 September.</p> <p>Her body showed no signs of a struggle and a report from the Guardia Civil shared with relatives indicates that Spanish detectives believe that the likely cause of death was suicide.</p> <p>Friends said they are concerned that the Spanish police have rushed to their conclusion without interviewing all of the residents in the apartment block or securing and analysing key evidence such as Hokkanen\u2019s two mobile phones and CCTV footage from nearby buildings.</p> <p>At the time of her death, Hokkanen, a product manager at Visa Europe, was on holiday with her boyfriend of seven years, Eugene Doris, 42. After an argument, he had left the apartment four hours before her fall to stay in a hostel.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Doris said he had only learned of his girlfriend\u2019s death when he was formally informed by the police nearly 24 hours after their argument.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think she was suicidal, no. I think we are just liaising with the police and trying to get evidence. The police investigation is not finished yet. I\u2019m looking to get Spanish lawyers to try and prod the police to investigate further with her phones and bank statements \u2026</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not her next of kin. I\u2019m her boyfriend, basically, not her husband or civil partner. Possibly it might be useful to get the Metropolitan police involved with the Spanish police.\u201d</p> <p>Asked as to what may have caused Hokkanen to fall to her death, he said: \u201cI think it might have [been] either something from the movie, Final Destination, something inexplicable \u2013 there\u2019s no CCTV footage, as I understand it \u2013 something you wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t conceive of unless you actually saw it or maybe she had, maybe, maybe she met with someone, a delivery driver, I\u2019m not sure, to be honest.</p> <p>\u201cI think the police are still, yes, the police are still looking into it. I think I have to liaise with them and I think with some lawyers as well. Possible it was an accident. Probably it was an accident, yeah, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p> <p>Final Destination was a supernatural horror film from 2000 in which survivors of a plane crash end up dying in a series of freak accidents.</p> <p>Doris, from Belfast, said the couple had been wine tasting earlier in the day but that she had not drunk a lot of alcohol. He said Hokkanen, a dual British-Finnish national with whom he had been in a relationship for seven years, was \u201cnot a heavy drinker\u201d and had drunk \u201cno more than normal\u201d.</p> <p>She had sent text messages to friends in which she had looked forward to a birthday party in London on 7 September and to a further holiday to Spain in October.</p> <p>The Met opened up a crime report after one of Hokkanen\u2019s friends reported concerns about the Spanish investigation on behalf of a larger group, including her two sisters. An Interpol notice was issued through which the Met has shared information with the Guardia Civil but the case remains within the jurisdiction of the Spanish authorities.</p> <p>A Met spokesperson said: \u201cOn Saturday 7 September the Met was made aware of an ongoing investigation concerning the death of a 50-year-old dual British national in Torrevieja, Spain.</p> <p>\u201cOfficers\u2019 role in such cases is limited to facilitating communication between overseas authorities and anyone here in London who believes they may have relevant information to share. Information has now been shared with Spanish authorities leading this case.

      "bodyText": "The family and friends of a British IT executive who fell to her death from an apartment block in Spain on the evening of her 50th birthday have called on the Metropolitan police to intervene in a Spanish police investigation into the fatality. Piia Hokkanen, who at the time of her death had borrowed her sister\u2019s holiday home for a three-day mini-break in Torrevieja, near Alicante, was found lifeless after falling from a communal window on to a neighbour\u2019s patio shortly after midnight on 4 September. Her body showed no signs of a struggle and a report from the Guardia Civil shared with relatives indicates that Spanish detectives believe that the likely cause of death was suicide. Friends said they are concerned that the Spanish police have rushed to their conclusion without interviewing all of the residents in the apartment block or securing and analysing key evidence such as Hokkanen\u2019s two mobile phones and CCTV footage from nearby buildings. At the time of her death, Hokkanen, a product manager at Visa Europe, was on holiday with her boyfriend of seven years, Eugene Doris, 42. After an argument, he had left the apartment four hours before her fall to stay in a hostel. Speaking to the Guardian, Doris said he had only learned of his girlfriend\u2019s death when he was formally informed by the police nearly 24 hours after their argument. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think she was suicidal, no. I think we are just liaising with the police and trying to get evidence. The police investigation is not finished yet. I\u2019m looking to get Spanish lawyers to try and prod the police to investigate further with her phones and bank statements \u2026 \u201cI\u2019m not her next of kin. I\u2019m her boyfriend, basically, not her husband or civil partner. Possibly it might be useful to get the Metropolitan police involved with the Spanish police.\u201d Asked as to what may have caused Hokkanen to fall to her death, he said: \u201cI think it might have [been] either something from the movie, Final Destination, something inexplicable \u2013 there\u2019s no CCTV footage, as I understand it \u2013 something you wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t conceive of unless you actually saw it or maybe she had, maybe, maybe she met with someone, a delivery driver, I\u2019m not sure, to be honest. \u201cI think the police are still, yes, the police are still looking into it. I think I have to liaise with them and I think with some lawyers as well. Possible it was an accident. Probably it was an accident, yeah, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d Final Destination was a supernatural horror film from 2000 in which survivors of a plane crash end up dying in a series of freak accidents. Doris, from Belfast, said the couple had been wine tasting earlier in the day but that she had not drunk a lot of alcohol. He said Hokkanen, a dual British-Finnish national with whom he had been in a relationship for seven years, was \u201cnot a heavy drinker\u201d and had drunk \u201cno more than normal\u201d. She had sent text messages to friends in which she had looked forward to a birthday party in London on 7 September and to a further holiday to Spain in October. The Met opened up a crime report after one of Hokkanen\u2019s friends reported concerns about the Spanish investigation on behalf of a larger group, including her two sisters. An Interpol notice was issued through which the Met has shared information with the Guardia Civil but the case remains within the jurisdiction of the Spanish authorities. A Met spokesperson said: \u201cOn Saturday 7 September the Met was made aware of an ongoing investigation concerning the death of a 50-year-old dual British national in Torrevieja, Spain. \u201cOfficers\u2019 role in such cases is limited to facilitating communication between overseas authorities and anyone here in London who believes they may have relevant information to share. Information has now been shared with Spanish authorities leading this case. It will be for them to determine whether further action may be required.\u201d According to the Spanish police report, Hokkanen, who lived with Doris in Kilburn, north-west London, was found at 00.20 on 4 September by a neighbour who heard the impact of her fall. She was not wearing outdoors clothes but only a T-shirt and knickers and one slipper. A second slipper was found pointing away from a second floor window overlooking where she had landed in the inner courtyard of the apartments. Hokkanen, who had lived in the UK for more than 25 years, appeared to have been holding an open toiletry bag when she fell. Toiletries, including lipstick, eyeliner, a cotton wool pad and a toothbrush, were spread on the third floor landing of the building. Doris said: \u201cI\u2019m doing OK. Well, I\u2019m just a little, well, I\u2019m a little, how can I put it, I don\u2019t have as many options as I\u2019d like, because I\u2019m not next of kin. I\u2019m not married to her. But I\u2019m also not sure if, how you can prod along a police force if you\u2019re not happy with them. They won\u2019t, they don\u2019t speak to me other than the original meeting, as it were, when they basically just consoled me on her death. That was basically what it was.\u201d Enrique Puerto, 44, from Barcelona, who had been a friend of Hokkanen for more than 20 years, said he had spoken to the local detectives but they appeared adamant that it was a case of suicide. He said: \u201cIf you are not a resident, and you are a foreigner, you become like a statistic, case closed.\u201d The Guardia Civil did not respond to a request for comment.",

Several Trump allies, including those who wrote the Project 2025 conservative manifesto, have called for the Republican nominee to root out dissenters and install obedient political apparatchiks within the federal government to help enact his wishes. \u201cNext time you won\u2019t have the integrity of Mike Pence: you\u2019ll have JD Vance who will do whatever Trump wants,\u201d said Troye, who is a Republican but has endorsed Kamala Harris for president. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning to think about a future Trump administration with just loyalists in these positions around him in these sort of moments that should be non-partisan. \u201cI hope voters are paying close attention to contrast between the responsible leadership shown by Biden and Harris and the dangerous demeanor of Donald Trump.\u201d Just last month, Trump signaled that his deal-making over disaster aid would not change if he were president again, warning that he would block assistance to California unless the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, agreed to deliver more water to farmers. \u201cGavin Newscum [Newsom] is going to sign those papers,\u201d Trump said from his golf course in California. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t sign those papers, we won\u2019t give him money to put out all his fires, and if we don\u2019t give him the money to put out his fires, he\u2019s got problems.\u201d Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary of the Trump campaign, did not answer questions regarding the allegations made by Carroll and Troye, and instead referenced efforts by Trump to improve forest wildfire management and repeated debunked claims that disaster relief money has been diverted by Fema to migrants. \u201cPresident Trump visited Georgia twice in one week to tour destruction from Hurricane Helene and has encouraged his supporters to donate more than $6m for relief efforts on the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cKamala Harris stole $1bn from Fema to pay for illegal migrant housing and now there\u2019s nothing left for struggling American citizens. President Trump is leading during this tragic moment while, once again, Kamala leaves Americans behind.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>We could feel the carefree spirit in the crisp air the moment we stepped off the train at Zell am See. It\u2019s in the town\u2019s DNA. Pleasure seekers have been coming to this lake and mountain resort in search of clean air, crystal waters and Alpine adventures ever since the railway connected what was then a mere village to Salzburg and beyond in 1875. We\u2019d come to walk, bike a little, swim a bit and reward ourselves with Austrian cuisine \u2013 at a restorative, schedule-free pace.</p>    <p>We passed bakeries, hiking shops and the Romanesque church in the old town on the way to our hotel, before joining the 10km tree-lined promenade that rings the lake. Waffle and ice-cream stands, terrace caf\u00e9s, strollers and couples holding hands, the glistening lake\u2026 It felt like we had gone back in time.</p> <p>Our hotel, the Tirolerhof, also had a timeless feel to it. A vernacular Alpine chalet, the reception lounge has winged armchairs, an open fire for snowy winter nights and a trad bar with stools and a small painted sign saying \u201cSave Water. Drink Champagne\u201d. Upstairs, the flower-filled balcony of our smart, wood-panelled bedroom looked straight on to the Schmittenh\u00f6he mountains. The sun was still high and so we headed straight out to <a href=\"https://www.zellamsee-kaprun.com/de/poi/strandbad-seespitz~2373\">Seespitz lido</a>, one of a handful of public lidos that pepper the lake.</p> <p>The lido was so perfect, it felt surreal: manicured lawns, teenagers playing frisbee, a caf\u00e9 selling apple cake and ice-creams, super-clean changing rooms, a heated, metal-lined swimming pool and steps leading into the cool, clear \u2013 and drinkable \u2013 lake. The mountains all around us, paddle-boarders ambling past, the <a href=\"https://www.schmitten.at/de/Schifffahrt-am-Zeller-See\">MS Schmittenh\u00f6he I Schiffart</a> heading to various drop-off points on the lake, including Thumersbach lido across the water \u2013 it\u2019s a dream ticket. The lake\u2019s charms are not lost on tourists from the Gulf States who have been coming to the resort to escape the sun ever since someone from the local tourist board realised that Zell am See\u2019s lake surrounded by snow-capped mountains matched the description of Paradise in the Qur\u2019an \u2013 and duly promoted the destination.</p>    <p>No holiday is complete without a round of mini golf, at least in my family, but the ersatz Brutalism and brushed steel of the \u201ccourse\u201d at Zell am See\u2019s Strandbad lido made me feel as though I was in an art installation.

The inn sits at 1,200m between the Kitzsteinhorn and Schmittenh\u00f6he. We devoured the view.</p>    <p>On the way back, we stopped for another dip at the Thumersbach lido \u2013 Lake Zell really is irresistible. As I swam, I thought of young Wordsworth having his moment of numinous awe as he rowed towards a looming mountain in the Lake District, and of how much more fun it was to be a teenager, or any age, really, if you were in striking distance of a sunny, blue-skied Alpine lake. That evening we had an exceptional dinner on the garden terrace of the Tirolerhof. The chef prepared a three-course dinner especially for the vegan among us, which turned out to be much envied by us pescatarians. It was a very strong contender for best-meal award during our visit to Zell am See, which celebrates its evolving culinary heritage during its annual <a href=\"https://www.zellamsee-kaprun.com/en/events/festival-of-alpine-cuisine\">Festival of Alpine Cuisine</a>.</p> <p>From early morning, we could hear cow bells jingling through our open shutters \u2013 surely the most charming of wake-up calls. After breakfast we nipped on a local bus to walk the 320m path that winds up through the <a href=\"https://www.klamm-kaprun.at/en/\">Sigmund Thun Klamm</a> gorge \u2013 a short but thrilling experience. Powering down from glaciers and mountains above the Kaprun Valley, the Kapruner Ache river has carved a gorge 30m deep; the wooden path takes you right up through it, past a series of small waterfalls, until you step away to the peace and openness of the Klammsee Reservoir, which itself makes for a lovely stroll. Ever on the look out for culinary pitstops, I spotted a sign off the path, pointing up to<a href=\"https://www.zellamsee-kaprun.com/de/poi/almwirtschaft-schneckenreith~1477\"> Schneckenreith</a>, a family-friendly hiking trail and eponymous farm which, I only later discovered, serves homemade cakes and local dishes.</p> <p>It took another local bus to the Maiskogel cable car station, and three cable cars, to make the ascent to the highest point of the Kitzsteinhorn glacier, the final one being the James Bond style 3k-Connection \u2013 so-named because the summit, or Top of Salzburg, is 3,039m above sea level. From the viewing platform, the Gipfelwelt 3000, you can see the peaks of Hohe Tauern National Park \u2013 apparently. Sadly, we had to imagine them: the mist had closed in and we couldn\u2019t see a thing.</p>    <p>Our eyes feasted that evening, though, as we were taken on a regional culinary tour over five courses at <a href=\"https://www.kraftwerk-restaurant.at/\">Kraftwerk</a> (<a href=\"http://kraftwerk-restaurant.at/\">kraftwerk-restaurant.at</a>), a local restaurant and wine bar. From a cellar of over 1,200 bottles, dishes are paired with wines from Japan, Lebanon and Uruguay, as well as from Austria.

Or whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> might more accurately channel her policy preferences than her husband, the Republican nominee yet again.</p> <p>Many subjects are missing. Not surprisingly, Melania has nothing to say about other women in her husband\u2019s life: E Jean Carroll (the woman Donald defamed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/07/donald-trump-rape-language-e-jean-carroll\">sexually assaulted</a>); Stormy Daniels (the adult film star whose hush-money payments led to Donald\u2019s criminal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/30/trump-trial-hush-money-verdict\">conviction</a>); Karen McDougal (the former Playboy Playmate who also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/karen-mcdougal-trump-alleged-hush-money-payments\">had an affair</a> with Donald). There are less than a handful of passing references to Ivanka, Donald\u2019s oldest daughter who he <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-the-view-ivanka-date/\">said</a> he would have dated if she weren\u2019t flesh and blood and who Melania is widely <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/02/24/us-news/melania-trump-battled-ivanka-for-spotlight-during-presidency-book/\">reported</a> to loathe. Trump\u2019s children by other women barely get a look-in. Melania does repeatedly say she loves her own son, Barron, and her parents too.</p> <p>True to form, no clue is offered as to who assisted in writing Melania. In contrast to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/14/breaking-history-review-jared-kushner-trump-book\">Breaking History</a>, the White House memoir by Jared Kushner, Ivanka\u2019s husband, Melania does not offer acknowledgments. It\u2019s a decent bet someone lent her a hand.</p> <p>Her book does contain 64 pages of photographs. The lead-off is a passport page, stamped on 27 August 1996 at JFK in New York, the day Melania arrived in the US. The final page includes a \u201cdigital collectible\u201d, available from <a href=\"http://melaniatrump.com/\">melaniatrump.com</a>. Like her husband, the brand is all. \u201cFinancial independence is a core value of mine,\u201d Melania writes. \u201cMelania Timepieces and Jewelry represented my passion, my project and my business \u2013 a symbol of independence, self-respect and empowerment for all women.\u201d</p> <p>Understandably, Melania\u2019s takes on policy have received more attention. Without mention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court\">Dobbs v Jackson</a>, the ruling by which a supreme court including three hardliners installed by Donald Trump gutted the constitutional right to abortion and privacy, her stand for personal freedom is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/melania-trump-memoir-defends-abortion-rights\">full-throated</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,\u201d she thunders. \u201cRestricting a woman\u2019s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body.

      "bodyText": "Melania Trump\u2019s eponymously titled memoir is a 180-page exercise in buck-passing and blame-dodging. The former US first lady blames staffers for plagiarizing Michelle Obama; repeatedly stresses her love for her husband despite professing to abhor lying liars who lie; and declares abortion a fundamental right, without pausing to consider Donald Trump\u2019s role in attacking it via the US supreme court. Melania is by no means an exhaustive read, but it does leave the reader asking why she has chosen to bare her soul just weeks before the election. Or whether Kamala Harris might more accurately channel her policy preferences than her husband, the Republican nominee yet again. Many subjects are missing. Not surprisingly, Melania has nothing to say about other women in her husband\u2019s life: E Jean Carroll (the woman Donald defamed and sexually assaulted); Stormy Daniels (the adult film star whose hush-money payments led to Donald\u2019s criminal conviction); Karen McDougal (the former Playboy Playmate who also had an affair with Donald). There are less than a handful of passing references to Ivanka, Donald\u2019s oldest daughter who he said he would have dated if she weren\u2019t flesh and blood and who Melania is widely reported to loathe. Trump\u2019s children by other women barely get a look-in. Melania does repeatedly say she loves her own son, Barron, and her parents too. True to form, no clue is offered as to who assisted in writing Melania. In contrast to Breaking History, the White House memoir by Jared Kushner, Ivanka\u2019s husband, Melania does not offer acknowledgments. It\u2019s a decent bet someone lent her a hand. Her book does contain 64 pages of photographs. The lead-off is a passport page, stamped on 27 August 1996 at JFK in New York, the day Melania arrived in the US. The final page includes a \u201cdigital collectible\u201d, available from melaniatrump.com. Like her husband, the brand is all. \u201cFinancial independence is a core value of mine,\u201d Melania writes. \u201cMelania Timepieces and Jewelry represented my passion, my project and my business \u2013 a symbol of independence, self-respect and empowerment for all women.\u201d Understandably, Melania\u2019s takes on policy have received more attention. Without mention of Dobbs v Jackson, the ruling by which a supreme court including three hardliners installed by Donald Trump gutted the constitutional right to abortion and privacy, her stand for personal freedom is full-throated. \u201cIt is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,\u201d she thunders. \u201cRestricting a woman\u2019s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.\u201d Simply put, such words jar with her party\u2019s record. And yet, another chapter is more telling still. Melania dumps on staffers for drafting the speech to the 2016 Republican convention in which she plagiarized Michelle Obama. Except Melania manages also to point the finger at herself. \u201cDuring my review of many speeches of previous first ladies, Michelle\u2019s emphasis on the fundamental values of hard work, integrity, and kindness resonated deeply,\u201d she writes, of a conversation with the aide who wrote the speech. In other words, Melania shows she was familiar with Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 speech to the Democratic convention, portions of which she would repeat to Republicans in Cleveland in 2016. There\u2019s more. Before speaking at the RNC, Melania \u201crehearsed multiple times with the teleprompter, feeling confident in my delivery\u201d. And yet, she claims, when the plagiarism was noticed and a media firestorm blew up, she was shocked. \u201cUpon closer examination, the undeniable similarities between the two speeches left me reeling.\u201d Really? \u201cI trusted that any and all political and legal vetting had been taken care of, but now I realized that the campaign and RNC had left me on my own.\u201d Talk about throwing the staff under any passing bus. And yet, to quote the deathless words of Kimberly Guilfoyle, Don Jr\u2019s fianc\u00e9e: \u201cThe best is yet to come.\u201d \u201c\u2018Why was the speech not vetted?\u2019, I asked Donald in frustration \u2026 From then on, I realized the importance of being intimately involved with every detail of my public life. No longer would I delegate specific tasks or trust others to ensure my reputation was protected.\u201d Specifically, Melania blames Meredith McIver of the Trump Organization \u2013 to whom she says she herself read Michelle Obama\u2019s words, words Melania then repeatedly practiced. As the saying goes, shit rolls downhill. When it comes to her husband, too, Melania is not in the blame game. The chaos of January 6 is dealt with as swiftly as anything inconvenient that actually makes it to her pages. She wags her finger at those who assaulted the Capitol in an attempt to overturn Donald\u2019s 2020 defeat but also claims to have been unaware of events for most of that terrible day. \u201cThe violence we witnessed was unequivocally unacceptable,\u201d she writes. But in her next breath, she adds that she \u201crecognized that many individuals felt the election was mishandled and that the vice president should halt the confirmation process\u201d. Naturally, Melania\u2019s take on protests following the murder of George Floyd is far more strident, complete with a condemnation of \u201cthe inflammatory rhetoric of Black Lives Matter leaders\u201d. Indeed, she does not expressly name Floyd, the Minneapolis man whose murder by police triggered the long hot protest summer of 2020. As for her husband\u2019s exhortation to the far-right Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d around the election, or his forecast of a \u201cBig protest in DC on January 6th[,] Be there, will be wild!\u201d, or his exhortation to followers to \u201cfight like hell\u201d? Crickets. Almost eight years have passed since Melania reportedly cried in sorrow on election night 2016, when her husband won the White House. She could yet return. Maybe that will provide enough material for another 180 pages. Melania is published in the US by Skyhorse",

They always say something like that. Don\u2019t become the story \u2013 that\u2019s supposedly the rule for pretty much anyone other than the prime minister.</p> <p>The prime minister is allowed to be the story, good or bad, because, by definition, what the prime minister does isn\u2019t a distraction, it\u2019s the thing itself. But anyone else can plead the blameless fact that they\u2019re accidentally distracting everyone from more important things. \u201cTalk of my private life\u201d, \u201cwidespread press reports of my cronyism and embezzlement\u201d, \u201cmy cut-price hair transplant that went hilariously wrong\u201d, \u201cthe relentless clip-clop of my amazing shoes\u201d \u2013 such things can become a distraction thanks to the silly media and their inability to just sit still and listen to the barrage of sensibleness that the government is trying to present.</p> <p>It flatters the ego too, inadvertently being a distraction. \u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry, everyone\u2019s looking at me again \u2013 how regrettable and inappropriate.\u201d \u201cOh dear, you\u2019re all staring at me while poor Sir Ian McKellen is in a nightie at the front pretending to be King Lear. Stop it everyone! Look at Sir Ian! Would it help if I stood still? Honestly, you should really be listening to Sir Ian \u2013 he\u2019s got a lot to say! Oh I\u2019ll just go. I\u2019m being a terribly watchable distraction. OK, I\u2019m heading off stage. Don\u2019t watch me. Keep your eyes on Sir Ian \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing as I stand in the wings. Apologies if you hear me sneeze a few times.\u201d</p> <p>So Sue has headed off stage, milliseconds before the vaudeville hook would have dragged her there anyway. Well done her. Now we can all settle down to be scintillated by the next act: Sir Keir Starmer and his Vital Work of Change \u2013 in which Keir sculpts a lifesize statue of Clement Attlee entirely out of 2ps that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/02/labour-peer-waheed-alli-under-lords-investigation\">contributed by Waheed Alli</a>. It\u2019s certainly worth an hour of your time.</p> <p>Does it make sense, though? This notion that you shouldn\u2019t become the story, that you mustn\u2019t distract? I\u2019m not sure. I think it might be all right sometimes for the story to be stuff that one member of the government team is doing \u2013 for there to be more than one point of focus \u2013 particularly when the prime minister is, as raconteurs go, somewhat on the dry side.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There are loads of people who speak warmly of Sue Gray's dedication, intelligence and dynamism, but fewer who\u2019ll go on the record saying she\u2019s had a great few months</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Admittedly, he said \u201csausages\u201d instead of \u201chostages\u201d, which was a brave attempt to lighten the mood surrounding that particular geopolitical shitstorm, but we can\u2019t expect gold like that every week. Others have to step up. I sense Wes Streeting might be comfortable being the story now and again. Sue Gray herself has previously been the story, to a certain extent, back when she was compiling her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-report-full-breakdown-findings-no-10-parties\">report on all of Boris Johnson\u2019s pandemic knees-ups</a>. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hard-and-fast rule. I reckon it might be OK to be the story, as long as the story about you isn\u2019t that you\u2019re shit at your job.</p> <p>Of late, that was the story told about Sue Gray. It may not be a true story, of course. There are loads of people who speak warmly of her dedication, intelligence and dynamism, but fewer who\u2019ll go on the record saying she\u2019s had a great few months. A narrative has developed that the government has got off to a bad start and, if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s partly her fault. And, if it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s even more her fault for allowing that narrative to develop.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/03/starmer-repaid-freebies-to-restore-trust-in-politics-minister-says\">Starmers\u2019 little haul of freebies </a>has been the opportunity for lots of vindictive noise from the rightwing press (but those guys are never going to vote Labour anyway), prompting a dutiful conniption fit from the left of the Labour party (but those guys basically always will). Some critics even seem to have constructed a rhetorical world in which the money Lady Starmer\u2019s dresses cost would otherwise have gone towards some old ladies\u2019 gas bills, which I\u2019m pretty sure isn\u2019t the economic reality.</p> <p>But what was Sue Gray doing amid all this negativity? It depends who you ask. Desperately wrestling disparate bands of misogynistic mediocrities into some sort of coherent government, some would say. Trying to divert public money into a derelict Belfast sports stadium while preventing Starmer\u2019s own team from having proper access to him, according to others. And all the while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/18/sue-gray-being-paid-170000-a-year-more-than-keir-starmer\">being paid at the rate of \u00a3170,000 a year</a>, which we know thanks to a leak from one of the many insiders who now seem to hate her. So it hasn\u2019t gone perfectly.</p> <p>It seemed to me, from the start, that appointing the person most associated with Boris Johnson\u2019s Partygate ignominy to an explicitly partisan Labour role was a colossally bad idea. The demolition of Johnson\u2019s already teetering reputation was very good news for Labour. That development needs to be treasured. So don\u2019t give Johnson the opportunity to claim that Gray\u2019s report, and his consequent and utterly justified public condemnation, was a stitch-up by a Labour mole lurking in a lefty civil service, because he will take that opportunity.</p> <p>For this reason, I would have thought that, of all the people on Earth to make Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, Sue Gray would be the one to avoid. I therefore assumed, naively it turns out, that since Starmer was surely aware of this huge downside, her gifts must have been unanswerably amazing. He must have felt that he simply had to have her in that job, that she alone could ensure his government\u2019s success. If that\u2019s the case, why has he let her go so easily?</p> <p>Clearly, it wasn\u2019t the case. While an obviously capable person, she has not succeeded in the role in the way Jonathan Powell did for Tony Blair. She didn\u2019t master the job. Either Starmer hugely overestimated her ability, or he hugely underestimated the importance of not issuing Boris Johnson with a potential Get-Out-of-Disgrace-Free card. He screwed up. He\u2019d better be careful he doesn\u2019t become a distraction from himself.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Sue Gray resigned as the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff last week, she said it was because she \u201crisked becoming a distraction to the government\u2019s vital work of change\u201d. They always say something like that. Don\u2019t become the story \u2013 that\u2019s supposedly the rule for pretty much anyone other than the prime minister. The prime minister is allowed to be the story, good or bad, because, by definition, what the prime minister does isn\u2019t a distraction, it\u2019s the thing itself. But anyone else can plead the blameless fact that they\u2019re accidentally distracting everyone from more important things. \u201cTalk of my private life\u201d, \u201cwidespread press reports of my cronyism and embezzlement\u201d, \u201cmy cut-price hair transplant that went hilariously wrong\u201d, \u201cthe relentless clip-clop of my amazing shoes\u201d \u2013 such things can become a distraction thanks to the silly media and their inability to just sit still and listen to the barrage of sensibleness that the government is trying to present. It flatters the ego too, inadvertently being a distraction. \u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry, everyone\u2019s looking at me again \u2013 how regrettable and inappropriate.\u201d \u201cOh dear, you\u2019re all staring at me while poor Sir Ian McKellen is in a nightie at the front pretending to be King Lear. Stop it everyone! Look at Sir Ian! Would it help if I stood still? Honestly, you should really be listening to Sir Ian \u2013 he\u2019s got a lot to say! Oh I\u2019ll just go. I\u2019m being a terribly watchable distraction. OK, I\u2019m heading off stage. Don\u2019t watch me. Keep your eyes on Sir Ian \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing as I stand in the wings. Apologies if you hear me sneeze a few times.\u201d So Sue has headed off stage, milliseconds before the vaudeville hook would have dragged her there anyway. Well done her. Now we can all settle down to be scintillated by the next act: Sir Keir Starmer and his Vital Work of Change \u2013 in which Keir sculpts a lifesize statue of Clement Attlee entirely out of 2ps that have been contributed by Waheed Alli. It\u2019s certainly worth an hour of your time. Does it make sense, though? This notion that you shouldn\u2019t become the story, that you mustn\u2019t distract? I\u2019m not sure. I think it might be all right sometimes for the story to be stuff that one member of the government team is doing \u2013 for there to be more than one point of focus \u2013 particularly when the prime minister is, as raconteurs go, somewhat on the dry side. Admittedly, he said \u201csausages\u201d instead of \u201chostages\u201d, which was a brave attempt to lighten the mood surrounding that particular geopolitical shitstorm, but we can\u2019t expect gold like that every week. Others have to step up. I sense Wes Streeting might be comfortable being the story now and again. Sue Gray herself has previously been the story, to a certain extent, back when she was compiling her report on all of Boris Johnson\u2019s pandemic knees-ups. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hard-and-fast rule. I reckon it might be OK to be the story, as long as the story about you isn\u2019t that you\u2019re shit at your job. Of late, that was the story told about Sue Gray. It may not be a true story, of course. There are loads of people who speak warmly of her dedication, intelligence and dynamism, but fewer who\u2019ll go on the record saying she\u2019s had a great few months. A narrative has developed that the government has got off to a bad start and, if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s partly her fault. And, if it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s even more her fault for allowing that narrative to develop. The Starmers\u2019 little haul of freebies has been the opportunity for lots of vindictive noise from the rightwing press (but those guys are never going to vote Labour anyway), prompting a dutiful conniption fit from the left of the Labour party (but those guys basically always will). Some critics even seem to have constructed a rhetorical world in which the money Lady Starmer\u2019s dresses cost would otherwise have gone towards some old ladies\u2019 gas bills, which I\u2019m pretty sure isn\u2019t the economic reality. But what was Sue Gray doing amid all this negativity? It depends who you ask. Desperately wrestling disparate bands of misogynistic mediocrities into some sort of coherent government, some would say. Trying to divert public money into a derelict Belfast sports stadium while preventing Starmer\u2019s own team from having proper access to him, according to others. And all the while being paid at the rate of \u00a3170,000 a year, which we know thanks to a leak from one of the many insiders who now seem to hate her. So it hasn\u2019t gone perfectly. It seemed to me, from the start, that appointing the person most associated with Boris Johnson\u2019s Partygate ignominy to an explicitly partisan Labour role was a colossally bad idea. The demolition of Johnson\u2019s already teetering reputation was very good news for Labour. That development needs to be treasured. So don\u2019t give Johnson the opportunity to claim that Gray\u2019s report, and his consequent and utterly justified public condemnation, was a stitch-up by a Labour mole lurking in a lefty civil service, because he will take that opportunity. For this reason, I would have thought that, of all the people on Earth to make Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, Sue Gray would be the one to avoid. I therefore assumed, naively it turns out, that since Starmer was surely aware of this huge downside, her gifts must have been unanswerably amazing. He must have felt that he simply had to have her in that job, that she alone could ensure his government\u2019s success. If that\u2019s the case, why has he let her go so easily? Clearly, it wasn\u2019t the case. While an obviously capable person, she has not succeeded in the role in the way Jonathan Powell did for Tony Blair. She didn\u2019t master the job. Either Starmer hugely overestimated her ability, or he hugely underestimated the importance of not issuing Boris Johnson with a potential Get-Out-of-Disgrace-Free card. He screwed up. He\u2019d better be careful he doesn\u2019t become a distraction from himself.",

He wants to try it out himself. \u201cHere we go,\u201d he says, \u201cfive.\u201d</p> <p>Yarris shakes his head, still befuddled by a 40-year-old memory. \u201cSee the insanity of death row?\u201d</p> <p>He had a lot of time to mull over such incongruities. In 1981, when he was 20, Yarris was picked up by the police in Pennsylvania in a stolen car while high on drugs. He became involved in a scuffle with the policeman, the officer\u2019s gun went off into the air and Yarris landed in jail, facing a lengthy prison sentence. While locked up, he read about the recent case of Linda Mae Craig, who had been raped and murdered about 20 miles from where he lived. Yarris decided \u2013 his head addled by methamphetamine use, he acknowledges \u2013 to try to reduce the punishment for his misdemeanour by saying he knew who had killed Craig: a local hoodlum who Yarris heard had recently died. The problem was that the man he pinned it on wasn\u2019t dead and was now a law-abiding citizen with an alibi. Yarris became the prime suspect in the Craig case.</p>    <p>In July 1982, Yarris was found guilty of murdering Craig<strong> </strong>and sentenced to death. He would spend 22 years on death row, mostly in Pennsylvania but also, after he escaped and went on the run for a month, in Florida (where he shared a facility with serial killer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ted-Bundy\">Ted Bundy</a>). It was two decades in which Yarris was stabbed, regularly beaten and watched men die in front of his eyes. It got so bad that, even though he was assured of his own innocence, he wrote to the state governor pleading for his right to execution. Ultimately, though, new DNA testing was developed and Yarris became the first death row prisoner to use it. In January 2004, he walked free.</p> <p>Yarris\u2019s story has been told in a memoir, an excellent 2015 documentary called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/15/fear-of-13-review-yarris-sington-death-row-documentary\">The Fear of 13</a></em> and now <a href=\"https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/36/by-lindsey-ferrentino/the-fear-of-13\">a play</a> of the same name, written by Lindsey Ferrentino and starring Brody as Yarris, which has just opened at the Donmar. (The title comes from a self-taught obsession with language and words that Yarris picked up in prison: \u201ctriskaidekaphobia\u201d being one of his favourites.) Part of the reason that his tale holds up to retelling is that it is a classic one: it\u2019s crime and punishment; a catastrophic injustice that is righted just in the nick of time; a damning indictment of the criminal justice system.</p> <p>But the main draw of the Nick Yarris story is Yarris himself: a captivating, labyrinthine storyteller with a sharp eye for the absurd. As he stands on the rehearsal room stage, in a theatrical recreation of his home for 22 years, it\u2019s hard not to think the experience would be triggering. But Yarris insists not. \u201cThrough a series of meticulous, polite behaviours, you can actually erase all of the pathogens back to the trauma,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten so good at it. Death row is like this memory of a movie I\u2019ve watched a long time ago a lot, and I know all the parts of the film, but none of it bothers me.\u201d</p> <p>These days, Yarris has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder thought to be caused by repeated blows to the head. It mixes uneasily with his aphasia, which can impair the way he communicates, and which dates back to a traumatic incident in his childhood. \u201cNabokov\u2019s message is true: our life can really be an artful thing if we\u2019re the projectionist and not the screen upon which someone else projects us,\u201d says Yarris. \u201cI know I\u2019m not supposed to be here. I\u2019ve been shot, strangled, I hung myself on death row. I\u2019ve been beaten and stabbed multiple times. I flipped a car over in 2022 in a wreck that I should have never walked away from. And I had to have brain scans for the next two years, telling me that right now I got a plaque buildup on my brain threatening to just eviscerate me at any moment.\u201d</p>    <p>Yarris turns to address Brody directly, the emotion obvious. \u201cWe just had a moment in the other room,\u201d he says. \u201cI walked up to one of the most beautiful men I know and I looked him in the face, and I thanked him for taking away every fucking punch, kick, everything they did to me. I looked him in the eyes with honesty, and I said, \u2018I can let go now.\u2019 You see, my biggest fear wasn\u2019t surviving death row. It was that I would die before I could tell my story. Most people who suffered deep trauma, that\u2019s their biggest fear: no one will hear me. No one will ever understand this pain or know what it was that I became.</p> <p>\u201cI am being given a once-in-a-lifetime gift,\u201d Yarris goes on, looking into Brody\u2019s eyes, \u201cand although it\u2019s humbling to be eulogised in front of yourself, I fucking earned it.\u201d</p> <p>Brody interjects tenderly, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>Yarris repeats, \u201cI fucking earned it.\u201d</p> <p>The idea for the play came to Ferrentino during the Covid pandemic. The American playwright, best known for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/19/lindsey-ferrentino-ugly-lies-the-bone-q-and-a-interview-nick-curtis\">Ugly Lies the Bone</a></em>, which was a hit in New York and at the National Theatre in London in 2017, watched the documentary of <em>The Fear of 13</em> and was compelled by Yarris\u2019s voice and his extraordinary lack of bitterness and self-pity. \u201cIt was during lockdown, and I was craving theatre, and it felt like theatre to me: just a man in a chair telling his life story,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI did think I could, naively, get the rights to that, whack it on stage and call it a day and have a new play.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond that, though, there was the drama of Yarris\u2019s extreme sliding-doors moment: why oh why, you want to scream, did he claim to know the killer? This sensation is made more profound when you learn that he was fully exonerated of the original crime that he was jailed for and would have walked free aged 21. \u201cIn the writing of it, the big theme that kept coming out was that every person is a few decisions away from having a completely different life,\u201d says Ferrentino. \u201cEveryone lives on a precipice of having their fate or their life choices be completely different. And Nick\u2019s story is, I think, a big example of that.\u201d</p> <p>The play, <em>The Fear of 13</em>, became then not a monologue, but a more complex redemption narrative told through the relationship between Yarris and his girlfriend Jackie Schaffer, who met him in prison when she volunteered for a charity campaigning to abolish the death penalty. An ensemble cast fill out the assorted judges, drug dealers and fellow inmates that steered his life in different ways.</p> <p>Ferrentino was in discussion with Brody about another project when she suggested he might like to play Yarris. It was a long shot: Brody started performing in theatre productions in New York aged 12, but hadn\u2019t acted on stage for more than 30 years. Besides, their accents are different \u2013 Brody is from Queens; Yarris has a strong Philadelphia twang \u2013 and they don\u2019t much look alike, either. But Ferrentino never saw the character as an impersonation.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, it should be said that I think Adrien Brody is a once-in-a-generation talent,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s open-hearted, deeply intelligent, very sensitive, very intellectual, but also very street smart, cunning, clever, witty. You can believe he would rob you, but you can also believe he would read Tolstoy. And Adrien is the only person I can think of that can do all those things, that can play an ex-con and can play a concert pianist.</p>    <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what Nick is. He has the soul of a poet, but a criminal history and is a brilliant, sensitive, open-hearted romantic and has had really hard circumstances, and used to be in prison fights, but also used to go back to his cell and read great literature and fall in love. It\u2019s a cliche about containing multitudes, but that\u2019s the most succinct way of saying it: both Nick and Adrien Brody contain the same multitudes.\u201d</p> <p>Brody signed on for <em>The Fear of 13</em> in a week. Why?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been open to doing theatre for some time, but I\u2019ve been waiting to find something that touched me and this came out of the blue,\u201d he says. \u201cLindsey and I were discussing something else, but she proposed this, and I was so moved by it. The first 10, 15 times I read the script, I could not get through it without crying.\u201d</p> <p>Another motivation was the deeper societal resonance of the story for Brody. \u201cThe system is broken\u2026 Hey Nick, did you read about that poor Japanese man who just served 50-some-odd years?\u201d he says over his shoulder to Yarris, referring to Iwao Hakamada, who was convicted of four murders in 1966 but finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/iwao-hakamada-acquitted-murder-japan-death-row\">acquitted and released</a> last month. \u201cHe\u2019s 88 or something, let out of prison. And they most likely planted evidence and tortured him into a confession. How could anyone grasp that? It\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse than dying,\u201d adds Yarris. \u201cI asked to die rather than linger.\u201d</p> <p>In preparation for the play, Brody and the rest of the cast visited Belmarsh, a high-security prison in south-east London. \u201cAnd if everybody wasn\u2019t staring at me, I could have just wept, because of how soul-robbing it is,\u201d says Brody. \u201cYou\u2019re surrounded by all these people who have no opportunity and are all needing love and appreciation and have made some dumb mistake in their life and are being punished for that.\u201d He turns to Yarris: \u201cYou\u2019re miraculous, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get at.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Donmar did feel like hallowed ground when I first stepped in. But once it\u2019s live, it\u2019s sink or swim</p> <footer> <cite>Adrien Brody</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brody, who is being paid the standard Donmar wage for his performance, has so far enjoyed the experience \u2013 for the most part. When he first arrived in London, he lived in the flat above the rehearsal room: it was a short commute but the whole experience was perhaps too intense. \u201cIt was like a Spike Jonze movie,\u201d he smiles, referencing the director of <em>Being John Malkovich</em>. \u201cI do mostly independent films and it\u2019s far from what people imagine the experience of a quote-unquote Hollywood actor. It\u2019s just not anything to do with the perception of what it is. But theatre is even more!\u201d He laughs.</p> <p>\u201cTheatre, you\u2019re living in the attic and you\u2019re working in the basement, and you don\u2019t leave and nobody brings you lunch. You go out and you\u2019ll get a sandwich at Tesco, and you munch it down and try to absorb all this material and try to represent so much. And you\u2019re with 10 other people doing the same and it is quite wonderful. I found it to be very gratifying \u2013 somewhat frightening, but gratifying \u2013 to face that.\u201d</p> <p>With the production moving into the theatre, and Brody leaving the attic, there\u2019s no hiding from the fact that this is really happening now. This is especially unavoidable at the Donmar Warehouse, which packs 251 audience members into a venue where no seat is more than four rows from the stage. Its fame has spread far and wide, especially under Sam Mendes in the 1990s and Michael Grandage in the 2000s, with still-talked-about performances from Nicole Kidman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law and Ewan McGregor.</p> <p>\u201cNicole Kidman was naked in it!\u201d says Brody. \u201cAdrien Brody was nearly naked in it! It did feel like hallowed ground when I first stepped in. But once it\u2019s live, it\u2019s sink or swim. And I don\u2019t like to sink, so I better start swimming.\u201d</p> <p>Even before <em>The Fear of 13</em> opened it was a smash: tickets for all performances for its two-month run sold out almost instantly. I point out, half-seriously, to Brody that he didn\u2019t really need to do this interview, because the Donmar couldn\u2019t sell any more seats. But he turns momentarily serious. \u201cWe did need to do this,\u201d he replies. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the publicity. But we need to honour what this is and also to respectfully portray something like this that is really important to be on people\u2019s radars.\u201d</p> <p>The clamour for tickets would not have been harmed by reviews coming from last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/18/2025-oscars-predictions\">Venice film festival</a> that suggest Brody is now a weighty favourite for a second Academy Award. The film is <em>The Brutalist</em>, a mesmerising, blind-siding epic from Brady Corbet, a child actor turned director, that runs at three-and-a-half hours with a 15-minute intermission and was made for just $10m. Brody plays L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a fictional Jewish-Hungarian architect of the Bauhaus school who emigrates to the United States after the second world war and stutteringly tries to rebuild his life and career. Peter Bradshaw in the <em>Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/05/the-brutalist-review-epic-adrien-brody-postwar-architectural-drama-stuns-and-electrifies\">described</a> Brody\u2019s turn as \u201ca career best for him, surely, and an advance on his performance in Roman Polanski\u2019s <em>The Pianist</em>\u201d.</p> <p>Brody does not shrug off the praise: it clearly means a lot to him. Around a decade ago, he admitted that he found himself sometimes disillusioned with the scope of the work he was being offered and his lack of control over the process. He turned to painting as a creative outlet. But over time, he has rekindled his love for acting: starting with roles in the superior television series <em>Peaky Blinders</em>, <em>Succession</em> and <em>Winning Time: </em><em>The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty</em>, and his fruitful, ongoing collaboration with Wes Anderson, and now with <em>The Fear of 13</em> and <em>The Brutalist</em>.</p> <p>\u201c<em>The Brutalist</em> has given me\u2026 I think I\u2019d been yearning for a role of that calibre, and a director of that calibre to honour the character,\u201d says Brody. \u201cIt\u2019s not simply in an actor\u2019s hands. And Brady did just that. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been working towards that. You have to continue. And I\u2019ve worked with wonderful people. I\u2019m not diminishing the work. It\u2019s just, <em>The Pianist</em> was a triumph, and it was a real achievement. And this had far fewer means, and is a very different journey. It\u2019s a remarkable thing.\u201d</p>    <p>Yarris listens in intently, and they fall into a good-natured spat about how bullish Brody should be about the Oscars. Yarris particularly liked his performance as Luca Changretta, the Italian-American mobster who shows up halfway through <em>Peaky Blinders</em>. \u201cDo me a favour,\u201d Yarris chides the actor. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking Adrien Brody. Own it! When you walk in there to collect your hardware, the head is up, the chin is up, and I want you to fucking own it!\u201d</p> <p>Brody mutters: \u201cIf that day comes\u2026 \u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2018If\u2019 is a weak word,\u201d Yarris fires back, \u201c<em>when</em> my day comes again. You are Luca Changretta, what the fuck!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to be more Luca Changretta,\u201d Brody accepts.</p> <p>Here, there is a parallel with Yarris: as Brody was winning his Oscar in 2003, Yarris was on the final push to overturn his conviction. The intervening years have been something of a mixed bag. He moved to the UK in 2005 and has since lived in the woods in Oregon and latterly in Los Angeles in a camper van. He\u2019s been married, divorced; fallen in and out of love. He\u2019s been rich, after his multimillion-dollar settlement, and not. He wants to write more books and he\u2019s working to develop a television series called <em>Kings of the Gallows</em>.</p> <p>\u201cCan I tell you?\u201d says Yarris, gazing over at Brody. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that you know how happy I am now, Adrien. Dude, I don\u2019t cry for any of it, so you don\u2019t have to. Like, I love you for the feelings that you\u2019re investing in all this. But man, I\u2019m smashing it now. I got the most beautiful girl in the world in love with me. I\u2019m literally walking around London the last week with smiles that are aching my face. I\u2019m happy as shit, man. I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p> <p>Yarris hasn\u2019t seen <em>The Fear of 13</em> play yet: he\u2019s realised there\u2019s little point trying to micromanage his life any more. Whatever happens next, it can\u2019t be stranger or harder than what he\u2019s faced down already. \u201cI\u2019m getting all these beautiful rewards for doing something that a lot of us should do anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cI held on to my humanity, no matter what. It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m proud of. In fact, I allowed death row to enhance it.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/36/by-lindsey-ferrentino/the-fear-of-13\">The Fear of 13</a> </em>runs at the Donmar Warehouse until 30 November</p>",

      "bodyText": "The rehearsal space for the Donmar Warehouse theatre is a scruffy, gymnasium-scale, subterranean cavern in Covent Garden. Strewn around, on Monday morning last week, are some telltale signs of stressful, long days: scrunched-up packs of bourbon biscuits and custard creams, and scattered pages of heavily inked script; also, intriguingly, four (empty) boxes of heavy-duty handcuffs. Dominating the room is a makeshift stage that looks like a boxing ring without ropes and measures 3.5 metres by 3.2 metres, almost the exact dimensions of a cell on death row. Nick Yarris, a power-bald man of 63 with high cheekbones and a scar on his chin, stands in one corner and starts pacing diagonally. \u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026 \u201d he says, counting his steps, his work boots making a resonant clunk as he walks. \u201cJay Smith used to be in the cell above me. And he was a very famous case too, the Susan Reinert murder and all this shit. But he would pace all day and he walked seven steps one way\u2026 \u201d Yarris has reached the other corner now and spins around. \u201cBut he only walked fucking six steps back!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cSeven there and six back. And I\u2019d be listening in my cell and it used to drive me mad, right? I said, \u2018Hey man, I got to try this out.\u2019 So I\u2019m in my cell\u2026 \u201d Adrien Brody, the 51-year-old Oscar-winning star of The Pianist, sits cross-legged in the corner, looking on. \u201cOne leg is shorter than the other probably,\u201d he suggests. \u201cOr he was going around his bed,\u201d counters Yarris. \u201cBut no, I tried that one. Maybe he was doing it deliberately: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s doing it deliberately\u2026 \u2019\u201d Brody springs to his feet; he has a lithe, athlete\u2019s build and a flop of dark hair. He wants to try it out himself. \u201cHere we go,\u201d he says, \u201cfive.\u201d Yarris shakes his head, still befuddled by a 40-year-old memory. \u201cSee the insanity of death row?\u201d He had a lot of time to mull over such incongruities. In 1981, when he was 20, Yarris was picked up by the police in Pennsylvania in a stolen car while high on drugs. He became involved in a scuffle with the policeman, the officer\u2019s gun went off into the air and Yarris landed in jail, facing a lengthy prison sentence. While locked up, he read about the recent case of Linda Mae Craig, who had been raped and murdered about 20 miles from where he lived. Yarris decided \u2013 his head addled by methamphetamine use, he acknowledges \u2013 to try to reduce the punishment for his misdemeanour by saying he knew who had killed Craig: a local hoodlum who Yarris heard had recently died. The problem was that the man he pinned it on wasn\u2019t dead and was now a law-abiding citizen with an alibi. Yarris became the prime suspect in the Craig case. In July 1982, Yarris was found guilty of murdering Craig and sentenced to death. He would spend 22 years on death row, mostly in Pennsylvania but also, after he escaped and went on the run for a month, in Florida (where he shared a facility with serial killer Ted Bundy). It was two decades in which Yarris was stabbed, regularly beaten and watched men die in front of his eyes. It got so bad that, even though he was assured of his own innocence, he wrote to the state governor pleading for his right to execution. Ultimately, though, new DNA testing was developed and Yarris became the first death row prisoner to use it. In January 2004, he walked free. Yarris\u2019s story has been told in a memoir, an excellent 2015 documentary called The Fear of 13 and now a play of the same name, written by Lindsey Ferrentino and starring Brody as Yarris, which has just opened at the Donmar. (The title comes from a self-taught obsession with language and words that Yarris picked up in prison: \u201ctriskaidekaphobia\u201d being one of his favourites.) Part of the reason that his tale holds up to retelling is that it is a classic one: it\u2019s crime and punishment; a catastrophic injustice that is righted just in the nick of time; a damning indictment of the criminal justice system.

I\u2019ve been shot, strangled, I hung myself on death row. I\u2019ve been beaten and stabbed multiple times. I flipped a car over in 2022 in a wreck that I should have never walked away from. And I had to have brain scans for the next two years, telling me that right now I got a plaque buildup on my brain threatening to just eviscerate me at any moment.\u201d Yarris turns to address Brody directly, the emotion obvious. \u201cWe just had a moment in the other room,\u201d he says. \u201cI walked up to one of the most beautiful men I know and I looked him in the face, and I thanked him for taking away every fucking punch, kick, everything they did to me.

Most people who suffered deep trauma, that\u2019s their biggest fear: no one will hear me. No one will ever understand this pain or know what it was that I became. \u201cI am being given a once-in-a-lifetime gift,\u201d Yarris goes on, looking into Brody\u2019s eyes, \u201cand although it\u2019s humbling to be eulogised in front of yourself, I fucking earned it.\u201d Brody interjects tenderly, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Yarris repeats, \u201cI fucking earned it.\u201d The idea for the play came to Ferrentino during the Covid pandemic. The American playwright, best known for Ugly Lies the Bone, which was a hit in New York and at the National Theatre in London in 2017, watched the documentary of The Fear of 13 and was compelled by Yarris\u2019s voice and his extraordinary lack of bitterness and self-pity. \u201cIt was during lockdown, and I was craving theatre, and it felt like theatre to me: just a man in a chair telling his life story,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI did think I could, naively, get the rights to that, whack it on stage and call it a day and have a new play.\u201d Beyond that, though, there was the drama of Yarris\u2019s extreme sliding-doors moment: why oh why, you want to scream, did he claim to know the killer? This sensation is made more profound when you learn that he was fully exonerated of the original crime that he was jailed for and would have walked free aged 21. \u201cIn the writing of it, the big theme that kept coming out was that every person is a few decisions away from having a completely different life,\u201d says Ferrentino. \u201cEveryone lives on a precipice of having their fate or their life choices be completely different. And Nick\u2019s story is, I think, a big example of that.\u201d The play, The Fear of 13, became then not a monologue, but a more complex redemption narrative told through the relationship between Yarris and his girlfriend Jackie Schaffer, who met him in prison when she volunteered for a charity campaigning to abolish the death penalty. An ensemble cast fill out the assorted judges, drug dealers and fellow inmates that steered his life in different ways. Ferrentino was in discussion with Brody about another project when she suggested he might like to play Yarris. It was a long shot: Brody started performing in theatre productions in New York aged 12, but hadn\u2019t acted on stage for more than 30 years. Besides, their accents are different \u2013 Brody is from Queens; Yarris has a strong Philadelphia twang \u2013 and they don\u2019t much look alike, either. But Ferrentino never saw the character as an impersonation. \u201cFirst of all, it should be said that I think Adrien Brody is a once-in-a-generation talent,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s open-hearted, deeply intelligent, very sensitive, very intellectual, but also very street smart, cunning, clever, witty. You can believe he would rob you, but you can also believe he would read Tolstoy. And Adrien is the only person I can think of that can do all those things, that can play an ex-con and can play a concert pianist. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what Nick is. He has the soul of a poet, but a criminal history and is a brilliant, sensitive, open-hearted romantic and has had really hard circumstances, and used to be in prison fights, but also used to go back to his cell and read great literature and fall in love. It\u2019s a cliche about containing multitudes, but that\u2019s the most succinct way of saying it: both Nick and Adrien Brody contain the same multitudes.\u201d Brody signed on for The Fear of 13 in a week. Why? \u201cI\u2019ve been open to doing theatre for some time, but I\u2019ve been waiting to find something that touched me and this came out of the blue,\u201d he says. \u201cLindsey and I were discussing something else, but she proposed this, and I was so moved by it. The first 10, 15 times I read the script, I could not get through it without crying.\u201d Another motivation was the deeper societal resonance of the story for Brody. \u201cThe system is broken\u2026 Hey Nick, did you read about that poor Japanese man who just served 50-some-odd years?\u201d he says over his shoulder to Yarris, referring to Iwao Hakamada, who was convicted of four murders in 1966 but finally acquitted and released last month. \u201cHe\u2019s 88 or something, let out of prison. And they most likely planted evidence and tortured him into a confession. How could anyone grasp that? It\u2019s impossible.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s worse than dying,\u201d adds Yarris. \u201cI asked to die rather than linger.\u201d In preparation for the play, Brody and the rest of the cast visited Belmarsh, a high-security prison in south-east London. \u201cAnd if everybody wasn\u2019t staring at me, I could have just wept, because of how soul-robbing it is,\u201d says Brody. \u201cYou\u2019re surrounded by all these people who have no opportunity and are all needing love and appreciation and have made some dumb mistake in their life and are being punished for that.\u201d He turns to Yarris: \u201cYou\u2019re miraculous, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get at.\u201d Brody, who is being paid the standard Donmar wage for his performance, has so far enjoyed the experience \u2013 for the most part. When he first arrived in London, he lived in the flat above the rehearsal room: it was a short commute but the whole experience was perhaps too intense. \u201cIt was like a Spike Jonze movie,\u201d he smiles, referencing the director of Being John Malkovich. \u201cI do mostly independent films and it\u2019s far from what people imagine the experience of a quote-unquote Hollywood actor. It\u2019s just not anything to do with the perception of what it is. But theatre is even more!\u201d He laughs. \u201cTheatre, you\u2019re living in the attic and you\u2019re working in the basement, and you don\u2019t leave and nobody brings you lunch. You go out and you\u2019ll get a sandwich at Tesco, and you munch it down and try to absorb all this material and try to represent so much. And you\u2019re with 10 other people doing the same and it is quite wonderful. I found it to be very gratifying \u2013 somewhat frightening, but gratifying \u2013 to face that.\u201d With the production moving into the theatre, and Brody leaving the attic, there\u2019s no hiding from the fact that this is really happening now. This is especially unavoidable at the Donmar Warehouse, which packs 251 audience members into a venue where no seat is more than four rows from the stage. Its fame has spread far and wide, especially under Sam Mendes in the 1990s and Michael Grandage in the 2000s, with still-talked-about performances from Nicole Kidman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law and Ewan McGregor. \u201cNicole Kidman was naked in it!\u201d says Brody. \u201cAdrien Brody was nearly naked in it! It did feel like hallowed ground when I first stepped in. But once it\u2019s live, it\u2019s sink or swim. And I don\u2019t like to sink, so I better start swimming.\u201d Even before The Fear of 13 opened it was a smash: tickets for all performances for its two-month run sold out almost instantly. I point out, half-seriously, to Brody that he didn\u2019t really need to do this interview, because the Donmar couldn\u2019t sell any more seats. But he turns momentarily serious. \u201cWe did need to do this,\u201d he replies. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the publicity. But we need to honour what this is and also to respectfully portray something like this that is really important to be on people\u2019s radars.\u201d The clamour for tickets would not have been harmed by reviews coming from last month\u2019s Venice film festival that suggest Brody is now a weighty favourite for a second Academy Award. The film is The Brutalist, a mesmerising, blind-siding epic from Brady Corbet, a child actor turned director, that runs at three-and-a-half hours with a 15-minute intermission and was made for just $10m. Brody plays L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a fictional Jewish-Hungarian architect of the Bauhaus school who emigrates to the United States after the second world war and stutteringly tries to rebuild his life and career. Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian described Brody\u2019s turn as \u201ca career best for him, surely, and an advance on his performance in Roman Polanski\u2019s The Pianist\u201d. Brody does not shrug off the praise: it clearly means a lot to him. Around a decade ago, he admitted that he found himself sometimes disillusioned with the scope of the work he was being offered and his lack of control over the process. He turned to painting as a creative outlet. But over time, he has rekindled his love for acting: starting with roles in the superior television series Peaky Blinders, Succession and Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty, and his fruitful, ongoing collaboration with Wes Anderson, and now with The Fear of 13 and The Brutalist. \u201cThe Brutalist has given me\u2026 I think I\u2019d been yearning for a role of that calibre, and a director of that calibre to honour the character,\u201d says Brody. \u201cIt\u2019s not simply in an actor\u2019s hands. And Brady did just that. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been working towards that. You have to continue. And I\u2019ve worked with wonderful people. I\u2019m not diminishing the work. It\u2019s just, The Pianist was a triumph, and it was a real achievement. And this had far fewer means, and is a very different journey. It\u2019s a remarkable thing.\u201d Yarris listens in intently, and they fall into a good-natured spat about how bullish Brody should be about the Oscars. Yarris particularly liked his performance as Luca Changretta, the Italian-American mobster who shows up halfway through Peaky Blinders. \u201cDo me a favour,\u201d Yarris chides the actor. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking Adrien Brody. Own it! When you walk in there to collect your hardware, the head is up, the chin is up, and I want you to fucking own it!\u201d Brody mutters: \u201cIf that day comes\u2026 \u201d \u201c\u2018If\u2019 is a weak word,\u201d Yarris fires back, \u201cwhen my day comes again. You are Luca Changretta, what the fuck!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got to be more Luca Changretta,\u201d Brody accepts. Here, there is a parallel with Yarris: as Brody was winning his Oscar in 2003, Yarris was on the final push to overturn his conviction. The intervening years have been something of a mixed bag. He moved to the UK in 2005 and has since lived in the woods in Oregon and latterly in Los Angeles in a camper van. He\u2019s been married, divorced; fallen in and out of love. He\u2019s been rich, after his multimillion-dollar settlement, and not. He wants to write more books and he\u2019s working to develop a television series called Kings of the Gallows. \u201cCan I tell you?\u201d says Yarris, gazing over at Brody. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that you know how happy I am now, Adrien. Dude, I don\u2019t cry for any of it, so you don\u2019t have to. Like, I love you for the feelings that you\u2019re investing in all this. But man, I\u2019m smashing it now. I got the most beautiful girl in the world in love with me. I\u2019m literally walking around London the last week with smiles that are aching my face. I\u2019m happy as shit, man. I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s so sweet.\u201d Yarris hasn\u2019t seen The Fear of 13 play yet: he\u2019s realised there\u2019s little point trying to micromanage his life any more. Whatever happens next, it can\u2019t be stranger or harder than what he\u2019s faced down already. \u201cI\u2019m getting all these beautiful rewards for doing something that a lot of us should do anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cI held on to my humanity, no matter what. It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m proud of. In fact, I allowed death row to enhance it.\u201d \u2022 The Fear of 13 runs at the Donmar Warehouse until 30 November",

After listening to his response, de Gaulle asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you think your view is somewhat romantic?\u201d</p>    <p>Cockburn had joined the Communist party in the 1930s and wrote for the <em>Daily Worker</em> (now the <em>Morning Star</em>). He covered the Spanish civil war for the paper and, as Patrick Cockburn puts it, \u201che thought the communists alone had the fanaticism and discipline to give the republic a fighting chance against General Franco\u201d. Reporting alongside him was the redoubtable Jean Ross, the second of his three partners, who was covering the war for the <em>Daily Express</em> and would file copy under Cockburn\u2019s name for the <em>Daily Worker</em> when he was at the front. Isherwood based Sally Bowles in <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em> on Ross.</p> <p>In Spain, he not only fought with the republican militia but engaged in an elaborate hoax to help it. Field guns for the republican military were being held at the French-Spanish frontier but Cockburn and his friend Otto Katz felt that if the French prime minister L\u00e9on Blum was to learn of a mutiny against Franco in Spanish Morocco he might let the guns through. A bogus story about the \u201cmutiny\u201d duly appeared and might well have led to Blum relaxing the border controls.</p> <p>When Cockburn told the story of the fake uprising a couple of decades later, it \u201cdid him reputational damage\u201d, as Patrick Cockburn puts it, but his father was unrepentant.</p> <p>\u201cI felt that Claud\u2019s derisive but unwavering suspicion of governments and the mainline media, always expecting the worst from both, was the correct posture for a polemical journalist,\u201d wrote Patrick in the introduction. \u201cHe disbelieved strongly in the axiom about telling \u2018truth to power\u2019, knowing that the rulers of the Earth have no wish to hear any such thing. Much more effective, he believed, is to tell truth to the powerless strongly, so they have a fighting chance in any struggle against the big battalions.\u201d</p>    <p>Was Patrick Cockburn surprised by what he discovered in his research? \u201cClaud was a much tougher and more practical man than I\u2019d pictured him growing up. He thought very carefully about how a single journalist, without resources, could influence events and how could a non-professional army win a war. A further reason for me deciding to write the book was is that, over the years reporting crises and wars, I came to feel that Claud\u2019s scepticism about the competence and good intentions of governments and powerful organisations in general was fully justified \u2013 something glaringly true today.\u201d</p> <p>Claud Cockburn\u2019s three sons all became journalists: Alexander, who died in 2012, moved to the US and wrote for <em>Village Voice</em>, the <em>Nation </em>and <em>CounterPunch</em>; Andrew is the Washington editor of <em>Harper\u2019s</em> and I have known them all.</p> <p>With the growth of the far right in Europe, and conflicts across the world, Patrick Cockburn said his father\u2019s work was particularly relevant. \u201cThese crises that turn into wars and governments increasingly having to cover things up means that dissident journalism is still relevant. It\u2019s as important now as it was in the 1930s. David can still do serious damage to Goliath, when you could wage an information guerrilla war against the powers that be.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Believe Nothing Until It Is Officially Denied: Claud Cockburn and the Invention of Guerrilla Journalism</em> by Patrick Cockburn is published by Verso on 22 October (\u00a330).

A further reason for me deciding to write the book was is that, over the years reporting crises and wars, I came to feel that Claud\u2019s scepticism about the competence and good intentions of governments and powerful organisations in general was fully justified \u2013 something glaringly true today.\u201d Claud Cockburn\u2019s three sons all became journalists: Alexander, who died in 2012, moved to the US and wrote for Village Voice, the Nation and CounterPunch; Andrew is the Washington editor of Harper\u2019s and I have known them all. With the growth of the far right in Europe, and conflicts across the world, Patrick Cockburn said his father\u2019s work was particularly relevant. \u201cThese crises that turn into wars and governments increasingly having to cover things up means that dissident journalism is still relevant. It\u2019s as important now as it was in the 1930s. David can still do serious damage to Goliath, when you could wage an information guerrilla war against the powers that be.\u201d \u2022 Believe Nothing Until It Is Officially Denied: Claud Cockburn and the Invention of Guerrilla Journalism by Patrick Cockburn is published by Verso on 22 October (\u00a330).

      "body": "<p>One of the things about writing a parenting column is that expectant parents sometimes ask me for advice, as strange as that may seem to those who actually know me (or read this column). My advice is mostly the usual stuff: support the head, pat their bums; never refuse an offer of help or a chance to sleep; and don\u2019t worry about nappy changes because any phobia of foul smells and runny fluids will quickly be replaced with a fear of everything on earth that can damage the fragile little person you\u2019re in charge of.</p> <p>Increasingly, however, I have to talk about money, too, because the single most abiding pressure of parenting \u2013 for those lucky enough to have healthy, happy children at least \u2013 is the fact that it is, basically, financially ruinous.</p> <p>I have been writing this column for six and a half years and I have never once mentioned how financially perilous it has been, mainly because I\u2019m aware that other people have it much worse. I also find it boring and embarrassing to write about my money worries full stop, and have an inkling that readers might feel the same reading about it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Baby formula costs \u00a317 and, here in the sixth richest country on the planet, shops routinely keep it security-tagged</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But ignoring money entirely becomes, itself, irresponsible. There have been many months \u2013 years in fact \u2013 where it has been the single biggest parenting issue in my life, and not being clear about this is negligent. Baby formula costs \u00a317 and, here in the sixth richest country on the planet, shops routinely keep it security-tagged. The UK\u2019s statutory maternity pay is among the lowest in Europe and yet Conservative leadership hopeful Kemi Badenoch thinks it\u2019s so high that it works against the \u2018personal responsibility\u2019 of mothers \u2013 the kind she exercised when she had the good sense to avoid such worries by marrying an investment banker.

      "bodyText": "One of the things about writing a parenting column is that expectant parents sometimes ask me for advice, as strange as that may seem to those who actually know me (or read this column). My advice is mostly the usual stuff: support the head, pat their bums; never refuse an offer of help or a chance to sleep; and don\u2019t worry about nappy changes because any phobia of foul smells and runny fluids will quickly be replaced with a fear of everything on earth that can damage the fragile little person you\u2019re in charge of. Increasingly, however, I have to talk about money, too, because the single most abiding pressure of parenting \u2013 for those lucky enough to have healthy, happy children at least \u2013 is the fact that it is, basically, financially ruinous. I have been writing this column for six and a half years and I have never once mentioned how financially perilous it has been, mainly because I\u2019m aware that other people have it much worse. I also find it boring and embarrassing to write about my money worries full stop, and have an inkling that readers might feel the same reading about it. But ignoring money entirely becomes, itself, irresponsible. There have been many months \u2013 years in fact \u2013 where it has been the single biggest parenting issue in my life, and not being clear about this is negligent. Baby formula costs \u00a317 and, here in the sixth richest country on the planet, shops routinely keep it security-tagged. The UK\u2019s statutory maternity pay is among the lowest in Europe and yet Conservative leadership hopeful Kemi Badenoch thinks it\u2019s so high that it works against the \u2018personal responsibility\u2019 of mothers \u2013 the kind she exercised when she had the good sense to avoid such worries by marrying an investment banker. Last month, we cheered when my daughter became eligible for 15 hours\u2019 free childcare, and this week her nursery\u2019s fees increased by almost the exact amount of money we would have saved. This, of course, is the problem with creating a system wherein the economic benefit of working must be offset by the economic cost of having children. On the macro level, the UK\u2019s powers-that-be claim to want its citizens to go forth and multiply. Think the \u2018breed for Britain\u2019 sloganeering, which accompanied the recent Tory party conference, rhetoric that had more than a slight ring of \u2018summon the brood mares\u2019 about it, even if they weren\u2019t simultaneously clamouring for economic conditions that would make such fecundity unfeasible.

      "body": "<p>When Michelle Fisher got involved with running the <a href=\"https://walthamstowtradeshall.com/\">Walthamstow Trades Hall</a>, a social club in north-east London, something surprised her: how excited new recruits get about their membership pack. It\u2019s nothing special \u2013 a faux-leather wallet containing a membership card and a fob for the door \u2013 but time and again, people kept asking: \u201cIs my wallet ready yet?\u201d Fisher laughs recounting this. \u201cPeople just want to be part of something,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially when everything else is a bit difficult and stressful.\u201d Tapping into this desire to belong, and to be invested in a community, has been central to Walthamstow Trades Hall\u2019s recent regeneration.</p> <p>Founded as a working men\u2019s club back in 1919, the club sits in an unassuming building on a residential street. So many letters have fallen off the sign at the front entrance that it reads \u201cT AM OW TR DES A L\u201d. But anyone is welcome here \u2013 and this open ethos has helped the club find new life. When I visit on a rainy day in early summer, I find Fisher, a friendly 32-year-old with her hair scraped back with a scrunchie, sitting in the club\u2019s cavernous main hall, typing away on her laptop as deliveries for the bar come in. She\u2019s been the club\u2019s secretary for two years, alongside a day job in tech (the club is not-for-profit, everyone on the committee is a volunteer). When she came on board, the Trades Hall\u2019s membership was declining, in common with many former working men\u2019s clubs around the country. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t financially viable, so we thought: how do we re-engage our local community?\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For your \u00a35-a-year membership, you have access to the building when it\u2019s open, you\u2019re not required to buy drinks</p> <footer> <cite>Maurice Champeau, Crookes Social Club</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The club needed to attract new members if it was going to survive. They did this by emphasising inclusivity \u2013 bunting made of gay Pride flags hangs across the rafters of the main hall, a note of brightness against the traditional patterned carpet, dartboard and dark wooden bar. They\u2019ve also gone out of their way to make people from the local South Asian community, many of whom don\u2019t drink, feel welcome. During the energy crisis last year, the club won funding from the council to set up the space as a community living room, meaning that anyone could come in to sit in a warm room, have a tea and charge their phone. The club offers a broad range of events to get people through the door \u2013 regular karaoke nights, tea dances for pensioners, choir practices and toddler sessions, quizzes and comedy. The strategy has proved effective: membership went up 105% last year, and another 60% this year. Their oldest member is 93 and the youngest 19. To Fisher, it makes sense that people would want to sign up. \u201cWe\u2019re all kind of floating about in cities and it\u2019s hard to find a tangible, physical thing to attach ourselves to and feel proud of and be involved in,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing able to give that to people is something really special.\u201d</p> <p>Private members\u2019 clubs are an enduring feature of British social life \u2013 and they come in many forms. \u201cEveryone knows what a pub is, but how they interpret a \u2018club\u2019 depends on their upbringing, class and geography,\u201d says Sean Ferris, who publishes several club trade magazines and runs the annual <a href=\"https://www.clubmirror.com/news/club-awards-official-photos\">Club Awards</a>. Working men\u2019s clubs were once the cornerstone of working-class life, while gentleman\u2019s clubs have long been a fixture in high society. Across the spectrum, many clubs are adapting their offering. Former working men\u2019s clubs, like the Walthamstow Trades Hall, are thinking about what they can offer their local communities. Sometimes, that simply means a place to go where you don\u2019t have to spend much; after a decade and a half of austerity, councils have sold off <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2019-03-04/sold-from-under-you\">thousands</a> of public spaces, such as community centres and libraries. \u201cFor your \u00a35-a-year membership, you have access to the building when it\u2019s open, you\u2019re not required to buy drinks,\u201d says Maurice Champeau, general manager of Crookes Social Club in Sheffield. His club brings in revenue by hosting events for the general public, which allows them to keep membership costs low.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale, a whole host of new elite clubs have shifted away from the model of fusty billiard rooms and dining halls to offer gyms, spas and co-working spaces to high-earning young professionals. New high-cost, self-described \u201cexclusive\u201d clubs seem to spring up every month \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.allbrightcollective.com/contact\">AllBright</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thetwentytwo.com/\">Twenty Two</a>, the <a href=\"https://georgeclub.com/\">George</a> \u2013 while others extend their reach. The ultimate example is the <a href=\"https://www.sohohouse.com/en-us/\">Soho House Group</a>, which has rapidly expanded since its founding in 1995 and now has 42 clubs around the world, and more than 200,000 members, with many more on waiting lists to join. The <a href=\"https://www.thegrouchoclub.com/\">Groucho Club</a>, founded in 1985, recently announced plans to open a new branch in Yorkshire. While the financial picture is more complicated \u2013 in 2023 the Soho House Group reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/15/soho-house-reports-loss-membership-private-members-club#:~:text=Soho%20House%2C%20the%20private%20members,%C2%A392.5m)%20for%202023.\">losses</a> of \u00a392.5m \u2013 the basic fact remains that a lot of people, all around the country and from different strata of society, want to join private clubs. Why does this particular tradition endure? Is it, as Fisher believes, about the desire for community \u2013 or is there something else at play?</p>    <p><em><strong>The sticky floors</strong></em> and open doors of the Walthamstow Trades Hall, where annual membership is \u00a335, seem a far cry from the pricey poolside cocktails of Soho House, where membership is closer to \u00a32,000 a year. But their history is intertwined. \u201cThe British are obsessed with socialising in a very regulated way, and clubs exist in all shapes and sizes,\u201d says Seth Alexander Th\u00e9voz, author of <em>Behind Closed Doors: The Secret Life of London Private Members\u2019 Clubs</em>. \u201cThe idea of the working men\u2019s club, which emerged in the 1850s, was a direct spin-off of Pall Mall clubs, an attempt to bring a slice of that community at affordable prices.\u201d</p> <p>Pall Mall is home to London\u2019s \u201cclubland\u201d, a row of imposing Georgian buildings, which has housed old-school private members\u2019 clubs since the 18th century. From the outset, many limited memberships topeople from a particular political group or profession; particular groups \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.garrickclub.co.uk/\">Garrick Club</a> for actors, the <a href=\"https://www.carltonclub.co.uk/\">Carlton</a> for Conservatives, the <a href=\"https://www.thefarmersclub.com/\">Farmers Club</a> for agricultural landowners. This was the Victorian era, when commentators frequently complained about social climbers and the nouveau riche, and elitism defined these clubs; they were essentially a way of institutionalising male power and privilege. Being nominated, elected and admitted into a club was a rite of passage for young aristocrats and a tangible confirmation of a hard-won status for those self-made men who made it into these hallowed hallways. (One example is Charles Dickens, who grew up in poverty, but became a member of the <a href=\"https://theathenaeum.co.uk/\">Athenaeum</a> club.)</p> <p>Many of these original clubs still exist today. Controversially, some still have rules associated with a bygone era. The Garrick, founded in 1831, hit the headlines in recent months after its men-only membership list, which includes senior judges and politicians, was revealed by the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/garrick-club\">Guardian</a></em>. Much of the outrage centred on the idea that women were being excluded from a space in which society\u2019s power brokers could meet, network and have important conversations. In July, after a public outcry, the Garrick admitted its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/01/judi-dench-and-sian-phillips-become-first-female-members-of-garrick-club\">first-ever female members</a>, the actors Dame Judi Dench and Sian Williams.</p> <p>Private members\u2019 clubs tend to flourish in times of political and social upheaval. The coffee houses of 17th-century London, out of which the Pall Mall clubs emerged, were places of debate after the English Civil War. The Groucho and Soho House emerged in the 1980s and 1990s as a challenge to the old-fashioned culture of traditional clubs, amid Thatcher\u2019s economic reset and the rise of new technology. Now, as interest in private members\u2019 clubs surges again, we are living in the long shadow of the 2008 financial crisis, a period of economic stagnation and dwindling national optimism.</p>    <p>\u201cWeirdly enough, clubs are counter-cyclical, they tend to do really badly when there\u2019s a boom in the economy overall, while usage goes right up in a recession,\u201d says Th\u00e9voz. He points to a prosaic reason for this \u2013 if you\u2019re a member, clubs can be surprisingly good value for a meal and a drink out.</p> <p>But perhaps it is also true that in a period of economic anxiety or political flux, the desire to prove one\u2019s social status or membership of a particular group or community feels even more pressing. Amy Milne-Smith, author of <em>London Clubland: A Cultural History of Gender and Class in Late-Victorian Britain,</em> has <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/clubs-in-london/\">argued</a> that \u201cthe renaissance of clubland in recent decades speaks much to a new age of elitism\u201d, with Oxbridge graduates dominating \u201cpolitical, economic, social and global networks of power\u201d. Perhaps that stamp of approval sought by Victorian self-made men also appeals to 21st-century young professionals.</p> <p>Today, \u201cprivate members\u2019 club\u201d is a broad category \u2013 some might offer gyms or spas, others lectures and events \u2013 but all promise a familiar environment in which to socialise and, typically, subsidised costs for food or drink for members. The idea of belonging to a group remains central to their appeal.</p> <p>Brian Clivaz is a restaurateur and club entrepreneur. He is a big name in the world of private clubs, and over his decades in the industry has founded <a href=\"https://www.homehouse.co.uk/\">Home House</a>, been managing director of the <a href=\"https://www.theartsclub.co.uk/\">Arts Club</a> and CEO of the <a href=\"https://www.devonshiresoho.co.uk/\">Devonshire</a>. We meet one morning at his Soho restaurant <a href=\"https://www.lescargot.co.uk/\">L\u2019Escargot</a>, talking over a coffee as staff bustle around us getting ready for the lunchtime service. Clivaz is wearing a sharp suit and braces, and his bulldog, Doris, sleeps on the floor. \u201cThere has to be a community of people and those people \u2013 the regulars \u2013 make the club,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe major reason clubs fail is because they don\u2019t get that community right. That\u2019s the magic.\u201d He explains his test: \u201cIf you went to the bar, could you strike up a conversation with the person next to you? Would you want to buy them a drink and, more importantly, would they be the sort of person who\u2019d want to buy a drink for you?\u201d</p> <p>Most people agree that the feeling of safety, predictability and familiarity is a major draw. Eleanor, 37, an advertising executive, joined London\u2019s Soho House branch over a decade ago, drawn in by an offer giving half-price membership to under-27s. \u201cIt was useful at a stage in my life when I was furiously dating a million people to take them somewhere familiar to me, where I felt safe because I knew the staff and they knew me,\u201d she says. \u201cThough if I\u2019m honest, there was some status about it, too.\u201d</p> <p>This hits on something central to the appeal of high-end clubs: social aspiration and the prestige of being part of an elite group. \u201cA club has to have a certain kudos, otherwise there\u2019s no point being a member of it,\u201d says Clivaz, matter-of-factly. \u201cIt\u2019s about social standing.\u201d The word \u201cexclusive\u201d features heavily in promotion; newspapers and magazines regularly round up lists of \u201cLondon\u2019s most exclusive clubs\u201d. Of course, a key part of curating a group of like-minded people is excluding people who do not meet these criteria.</p> <p>Clubs of all stripes face a constant tension between the need for exclusivity and the need to bring in members, and the financial revenue that comes with them. Soho House has come under criticism for expanding too much and losing the allure of exclusivity. The <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sohohousememes/?hl=en\">@sohohousememes</a> account on Instagram has 135k followers, with posts decrying high prices and shoddy service. A recent caption reads: \u201cAt least my wine will be considered a vintage by the time it arrives.\u201d Eleanor recently ended her membership for this reason. \u201cIt expanded so quickly. When I first joined, I knew a lot of people who were being rejected from the membership. They had strict criteria around being a successful person in the arts \u2013 and then that completely changed. They just let absolutely anyone in who wanted to pay to be there.\u201d</p> <p>From the Garrick Club to former working men\u2019s clubs, members can be reluctant to change their entry rules, even if changing times necessitate it. \u201cI never cease to be amazed that all committees have the same sort of arguments, from an East End working men\u2019s club to a Pall Mall gentleman\u2019s club,\u201d says Th\u00e9voz. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with sinking funds, long-term dilapidation, keeping subscriptions cheap and affordable, but also pulling up the drawbridge.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The test is, \u2018If you went to the bar, could you strike up a conversation with the person next to you?\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Brian Clivaz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet for all these similarities, elite clubs celebrate prestige and social status and are thriving, while working men\u2019s clubs were set up to foster local communities and are facing catastrophic decline. \u201cWorking men\u2019s clubs are slowly dying,and we have to either evolve or go extinct,\u201d says Champeau. When he joined Crookes a few years ago it was in dire straits, with a bucket being passed around the members to raise money for the electricity bill. Champeau, a pub landlord by trade, opened the club up to the general public and started renting out function rooms. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to be very flexible with what the space is used for,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s open arms \u2013 get people in and let them have a good time.\u201d Now Crookes might host a drag night or a punk concert in one room, while old-time members play board games in the next. Some longstanding members quit in protest, but the club is thriving.</p> <p>At the Walthamstow Trades Hall, eschewing elitism to open up to everyone has also proved an effective strategy. At first, displaying Pride flags alarmed some of the old-time members, but the club secretary approached this pragmatically, explaining that hosting a few LGBTQ+ events didn\u2019t mean it was now a gay club, simply that everyone was welcome. Gradually, even the staunchest critics have come round, and some old traditions endure. Each month, a group of pensioners hold a tea dance in the main hall. They bring their own buffet and dance to the same tunes they\u2019ve been dancing to for the last 20 years. \u201cThese are relationships that were built within these walls, which I think is a really special thing to see,\u201d says Fisher.</p> <p>In her view, the club provides something permanent in a tumultuous world. \u201cPolitical climates are temporary, but clubs provide a constant,\u201d she says. \u201cFor some people it might be a community centre or it might be their church or mosque, and for other people it\u2019s coming to the club and playing pool. Those spaces should be protected at all costs. They are fundamental to what kind of society we want to end up being.\u201d</p>",

Now, as interest in private members\u2019 clubs surges again, we are living in the long shadow of the 2008 financial crisis, a period of economic stagnation and dwindling national optimism. \u201cWeirdly enough, clubs are counter-cyclical, they tend to do really badly when there\u2019s a boom in the economy overall, while usage goes right up in a recession,\u201d says Th\u00e9voz. He points to a prosaic reason for this \u2013 if you\u2019re a member, clubs can be surprisingly good value for a meal and a drink out. But perhaps it is also true that in a period of economic anxiety or political flux, the desire to prove one\u2019s social status or membership of a particular group or community feels even more pressing. Amy Milne-Smith, author of London Clubland: A Cultural History of Gender and Class in Late-Victorian Britain, has argued that \u201cthe renaissance of clubland in recent decades speaks much to a new age of elitism\u201d, with Oxbridge graduates dominating \u201cpolitical, economic, social and global networks of power\u201d. Perhaps that stamp of approval sought by Victorian self-made men also appeals to 21st-century young professionals. Today, \u201cprivate members\u2019 club\u201d is a broad category \u2013 some might offer gyms or spas, others lectures and events \u2013 but all promise a familiar environment in which to socialise and, typically, subsidised costs for food or drink for members. The idea of belonging to a group remains central to their appeal. Brian Clivaz is a restaurateur and club entrepreneur. He is a big name in the world of private clubs, and over his decades in the industry has founded Home House, been managing director of the Arts Club and CEO of the Devonshire. We meet one morning at his Soho restaurant L\u2019Escargot, talking over a coffee as staff bustle around us getting ready for the lunchtime service. Clivaz is wearing a sharp suit and braces, and his bulldog, Doris, sleeps on the floor. \u201cThere has to be a community of people and those people \u2013 the regulars \u2013 make the club,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe major reason clubs fail is because they don\u2019t get that community right. That\u2019s the magic.\u201d He explains his test: \u201cIf you went to the bar, could you strike up a conversation with the person next to you? Would you want to buy them a drink and, more importantly, would they be the sort of person who\u2019d want to buy a drink for you?\u201d Most people agree that the feeling of safety, predictability and familiarity is a major draw. Eleanor, 37, an advertising executive, joined London\u2019s Soho House branch over a decade ago, drawn in by an offer giving half-price membership to under-27s. \u201cIt was useful at a stage in my life when I was furiously dating a million people to take them somewhere familiar to me, where I felt safe because I knew the staff and they knew me,\u201d she says. \u201cThough if I\u2019m honest, there was some status about it, too.\u201d This hits on something central to the appeal of high-end clubs: social aspiration and the prestige of being part of an elite group. \u201cA club has to have a certain kudos, otherwise there\u2019s no point being a member of it,\u201d says Clivaz, matter-of-factly. \u201cIt\u2019s about social standing.\u201d The word \u201cexclusive\u201d features heavily in promotion; newspapers and magazines regularly round up lists of \u201cLondon\u2019s most exclusive clubs\u201d. Of course, a key part of curating a group of like-minded people is excluding people who do not meet these criteria. Clubs of all stripes face a constant tension between the need for exclusivity and the need to bring in members, and the financial revenue that comes with them. Soho House has come under criticism for expanding too much and losing the allure of exclusivity. The @sohohousememes account on Instagram has 135k followers, with posts decrying high prices and shoddy service. A recent caption reads: \u201cAt least my wine will be considered a vintage by the time it arrives.\u201d Eleanor recently ended her membership for this reason. \u201cIt expanded so quickly. When I first joined, I knew a lot of people who were being rejected from the membership. They had strict criteria around being a successful person in the arts \u2013 and then that completely changed. They just let absolutely anyone in who wanted to pay to be there.\u201d From the Garrick Club to former working men\u2019s clubs, members can be reluctant to change their entry rules, even if changing times necessitate it. \u201cI never cease to be amazed that all committees have the same sort of arguments, from an East End working men\u2019s club to a Pall Mall gentleman\u2019s club,\u201d says Th\u00e9voz. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with sinking funds, long-term dilapidation, keeping subscriptions cheap and affordable, but also pulling up the drawbridge.\u201d Yet for all these similarities, elite clubs celebrate prestige and social status and are thriving, while working men\u2019s clubs were set up to foster local communities and are facing catastrophic decline. \u201cWorking men\u2019s clubs are slowly dying,and we have to either evolve or go extinct,\u201d says Champeau. When he joined Crookes a few years ago it was in dire straits, with a bucket being passed around the members to raise money for the electricity bill. Champeau, a pub landlord by trade, opened the club up to the general public and started renting out function rooms. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to be very flexible with what the space is used for,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s open arms \u2013 get people in and let them have a good time.\u201d Now Crookes might host a drag night or a punk concert in one room, while old-time members play board games in the next. Some longstanding members quit in protest, but the club is thriving. At the Walthamstow Trades Hall, eschewing elitism to open up to everyone has also proved an effective strategy. At first, displaying Pride flags alarmed some of the old-time members, but the club secretary approached this pragmatically, explaining that hosting a few LGBTQ+ events didn\u2019t mean it was now a gay club, simply that everyone was welcome. Gradually, even the staunchest critics have come round, and some old traditions endure. Each month, a group of pensioners hold a tea dance in the main hall. They bring their own buffet and dance to the same tunes they\u2019ve been dancing to for the last 20 years. \u201cThese are relationships that were built within these walls, which I think is a really special thing to see,\u201d says Fisher. In her view, the club provides something permanent in a tumultuous world. \u201cPolitical climates are temporary, but clubs provide a constant,\u201d she says. \u201cFor some people it might be a community centre or it might be their church or mosque, and for other people it\u2019s coming to the club and playing pool. Those spaces should be protected at all costs. They are fundamental to what kind of society we want to end up being.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A mist of fine dots spreads across the pale face, with its distinctive moon shape. Scimitar eyebrows rise above a lowered gaze. The half-open mouth is kissably soft, and the hair still lies in a boyish fringe. Francis Bacon is 78 years old, but has made himself 25 once more. You would recognise him any time, anywhere.</p> <p>This strange and captivating self-portrait hangs at the entrance to <strong><a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/exhibitions/2024/francis-bacon-portraits?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw05i4BhDiARIsAB_2wfDZMJ9aVCDREwX_T8NHwjAdskynweK_EtCK6udvXY_Arw-HTmpXqEYaAo3-EALw_wcB\">Francis Bacon: Human Presence</a></strong> at the National Portrait Gallery \u2013 a peculiarly misleading start to the \u201cfirst exhibition in nearly 20 years to focus on his portraits\u201d. What else did Bacon paint but human animals, more or less? It seems an odd exercise to single out these 55 paintings as portraits, not least because the one recognisable face is Bacon\u2019s own.</p>    <p>It is true that some titles half-promise a portrait \u2013 <em>Study for a </em><em>Pope</em>, <em>Seated Woman</em>, <em>Study for a Portrait</em>. It is also true that others name a lover \u2013 the former pilot <a href=\"https://www.francis-bacon.com/life/family-friends-sitters/peter-lacy\">Peter Lacy</a>, who whipped and beat Bacon; the former boxer <a href=\"https://www.francis-bacon.com/life/family-friends-sitters/george-dyer\">George Dyer</a>, who killed himself in their hotel room, aged 37; the bartender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/07/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">John Edwards</a>, who died of cancer at 53. Still others depict female friends: artist Isabel Rawsthorne, writer Henrietta Moraes and Muriel Belcher, proprietor of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/sep/13/from-francis-bacon-to-tracey-emin-soho-historic-colony-room-club-in-pictures\">Colony Room Club</a>. But how useful is the word depiction?</p> <p>If it weren\u2019t for the fabulous period photographs threaded through this show, could you really tell Rawsthorne from Belcher, say, or Frank Auerbach from Lucian Freud? Faces materialise out of darkness, or deeply stained colour: squashed, contorted, twisted, swerving, totally plastic and amorphous, yet so suavely defined that you wonder how on earth Bacon does it. Look closely into each picture, and you can see how he works the paint into blurs and fades, swipes and evaporations, scumbled lines, energetic swipes, pristine discs and hyphens, but not how these transitions occur. He remains the most mysterious of conjurors.</p> <p>The show starts with men in black, sometimes screaming, occasionally caged, always solo. A mouth opens in a yowl, the top of the head missing in the seething nightclub blackness; a drinker in a sharp suit leans on a contour line suggesting a bar. I don\u2019t know who they are, and I doubt the curators do either. They could be Peter Lacy or Ronnie Kray, or even Kenneth Williams; Bacon can veer quite dramatically from agony to <em>Carry On</em> comedy, especially when the teeth inside the howling mouth are pearly white and tiny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Soon we are in Bacon\u2019s world\u2026 those faces that look as if they\u2019ve been squashed sideways with the violent flat of a hand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And the effort to find lesser-known Bacons sometimes produces outright farce at the NPG. A very cheery pope in orange, pink and green burbles across the gallery from Bacon\u2019s ludicrous reprise of Van Gogh\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/highlights/self-portrait-with-bandaged-ear/\">Self-Portrait With Bandaged Ear</a></em>; as if Vincent hadn\u2019t suffered enough.</p> <p>But soon we are in Bacon\u2019s own familiar world: those flat backdrops of glowing darkness and architectural sketch lines that hint at nameless bedrooms, cells or bars; those faces that look as if they have been squashed sideways with the violent flat of a hand; one good eye, the other blotted out behind shattered <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/battleship-potemkin-eisenstein-arthouse\">Battleship Potemkin</a></em> glasses.</p>    <p>Muriel Belcher appears three times in a sequence, turning like a gyre, with her pencilled eyebrows, high forehead and thinning hair. John Edwards sits in his underpants in a chair, casting a pink shadow shaped like one of Lynn Chadwick\u2019s flightless bronze birds. Henrietta Moraes lies on a ticking mattress in the nude, body corkscrewed, black circles on knees and buttocks, features scrambled to oblivion. The image is based on a photograph Bacon commissioned from John Deakin, who sold copies of it to sailors in Soho for 10 shillings a time.</p> <p>The film-maker John Maybury, in his catalogue essay, has a riveting phrase for the gay community at Belcher\u2019s club when homosexuality was still illegal: \u201cThe fearlessness of emboldened alcoholics allowed to shout into the void in a small, nicotine-stained green room.\u201d That gets to the force of Bacon\u2019s art; perhaps even to the composition and colour. The viridian green of the Colony Room seeps, particularly, into images of Peter Lacy, described as the love of Bacon\u2019s life. Not that you have any true sense of that relationship from the small range of closeup heads presented here.</p> <p>Uneasy, harrowing, claustrophobic: that\u2019s what people say about his art. And at one point Bacon himself is quoted as wondering whether Lacy\u2019s neurosis has somehow crept into the pictures. But how can anyone really tell, when he is as compacted and distorted as everyone else? And what about the ebullience, energy and overwhelming beauty of Bacon\u2019s art?</p>    <p>One revelation of this show may be the significance of colour. Bacon was a sensationally gifted colourist: a sumptuous cobalt blue pours from the bottom of one painting; mauve, gold and papal purple glow from another; scarlet and orange burn so hot they light up the mood as well as the gallery. And Bacon seems to use different palettes for his lovers. He so admired George Dyer\u2019s profile that he made a template to reuse; you see it against midnight blackness, but also against an alizarin crimson that seeps like spilt blood into the canvas, especially in the final triptych of Dyer\u2019s suicide.</p> <p>The curators seem to want us to discover biography, incident and narrative in these paintings; but such interpretations feel like overlay. If Bacon can base his image of Lucian Freud on a photograph of Franz Kafka, something more (or less) than a portrait is being made. And if one of his own self-portraits incorporates Freud\u2019s body then literal appearance is not at stake. The relationship of these paintings to likeness lies, instead, in their radical similarity to each other at their best \u2013 images of life forces so zestful, original and wild they hold their own outside the old conventions of portraiture.</p> <p>Just in time for Halloween, the South Korean artist <strong><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/mire-lee\">Mire Lee</a></strong> has filled the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern with ghosts and ghouls, in the shape of what she calls \u201cskins\u201d stretched tight on metal frames that dangle from the ceiling. Munch\u2019s <em>The Scream</em>, howling banshees, giant spiders, horror-shop masks and flailing spectres swing and flutter in the air. Each is the colour of dried blood, stained by the dye dripping like constant rain from a colossal turbine that slowly turns above us, draped in oozing, flapping tentacles.</p>    <p>Panels explain the references to our industrial past, and the toll it takes on human beings. The skins apparently speak of our anatomy, rammed home by Lee\u2019s title: <em>Open Wound</em>. The whole installation will grow darker with the months, as the dye deepens in hue, and \u2013 it is presumably hoped \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/tate-etc/issue-63-autumn-2024/it-has-to-be-sloppy-mire-lee\">metaphorical meaning</a> with it.</p> <p>It rains, it churns; the skins shiver and multiply. There are 98 of them now, increasing to 150 by next March. But I cannot imagine that the numbers will matter. Nothing looked more fascinating in closeup, nothing developed, nothing further presented itself to eye, ear or mind than the spectacle of it all on entry, which was sheer mechanical hokum.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (our of five)</em><br><em>Francis Bacon: Human Presence </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>Hyundai Commission: Mire Lee: Open Wound</em> \u2605\u2605</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/exhibitions/2024/francis-bacon-portraits?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw05i4BhDiARIsAB_2wfDZMJ9aVCDREwX_T8NHwjAdskynweK_EtCK6udvXY_Arw-HTmpXqEYaAo3-EALw_wcB\">Francis Bacon: Human Presence</a> is at the National Portrait Gallery, London, until 19 January 2025 <br></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/mire-lee\">Hyundai Commission: Mire Lee: Open Wound</a> is at the Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London, until 16 March 2025</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "A mist of fine dots spreads across the pale face, with its distinctive moon shape. Scimitar eyebrows rise above a lowered gaze. The half-open mouth is kissably soft, and the hair still lies in a boyish fringe. Francis Bacon is 78 years old, but has made himself 25 once more. You would recognise him any time, anywhere. This strange and captivating self-portrait hangs at the entrance to Francis Bacon: Human Presence at the National Portrait Gallery \u2013 a peculiarly misleading start to the \u201cfirst exhibition in nearly 20 years to focus on his portraits\u201d. What else did Bacon paint but human animals, more or less? It seems an odd exercise to single out these 55 paintings as portraits, not least because the one recognisable face is Bacon\u2019s own. It is true that some titles half-promise a portrait \u2013 Study for a Pope, Seated Woman, Study for a Portrait. It is also true that others name a lover \u2013 the former pilot Peter Lacy, who whipped and beat Bacon; the former boxer George Dyer, who killed himself in their hotel room, aged 37; the bartender John Edwards, who died of cancer at 53. Still others depict female friends: artist Isabel Rawsthorne, writer Henrietta Moraes and Muriel Belcher, proprietor of the Colony Room Club. But how useful is the word depiction? If it weren\u2019t for the fabulous period photographs threaded through this show, could you really tell Rawsthorne from Belcher, say, or Frank Auerbach from Lucian Freud? Faces materialise out of darkness, or deeply stained colour: squashed, contorted, twisted, swerving, totally plastic and amorphous, yet so suavely defined that you wonder how on earth Bacon does it. Look closely into each picture, and you can see how he works the paint into blurs and fades, swipes and evaporations, scumbled lines, energetic swipes, pristine discs and hyphens, but not how these transitions occur. He remains the most mysterious of conjurors. The show starts with men in black, sometimes screaming, occasionally caged, always solo. A mouth opens in a yowl, the top of the head missing in the seething nightclub blackness; a drinker in a sharp suit leans on a contour line suggesting a bar. I don\u2019t know who they are, and I doubt the curators do either. They could be Peter Lacy or Ronnie Kray, or even Kenneth Williams; Bacon can veer quite dramatically from agony to Carry On comedy, especially when the teeth inside the howling mouth are pearly white and tiny. And the effort to find lesser-known Bacons sometimes produces outright farce at the NPG. A very cheery pope in orange, pink and green burbles across the gallery from Bacon\u2019s ludicrous reprise of Van Gogh\u2019s Self-Portrait With Bandaged Ear; as if Vincent hadn\u2019t suffered enough. But soon we are in Bacon\u2019s own familiar world: those flat backdrops of glowing darkness and architectural sketch lines that hint at nameless bedrooms, cells or bars; those faces that look as if they have been squashed sideways with the violent flat of a hand; one good eye, the other blotted out behind shattered Battleship Potemkin glasses. Muriel Belcher appears three times in a sequence, turning like a gyre, with her pencilled eyebrows, high forehead and thinning hair. John Edwards sits in his underpants in a chair, casting a pink shadow shaped like one of Lynn Chadwick\u2019s flightless bronze birds. Henrietta Moraes lies on a ticking mattress in the nude, body corkscrewed, black circles on knees and buttocks, features scrambled to oblivion. The image is based on a photograph Bacon commissioned from John Deakin, who sold copies of it to sailors in Soho for 10 shillings a time. The film-maker John Maybury, in his catalogue essay, has a riveting phrase for the gay community at Belcher\u2019s club when homosexuality was still illegal: \u201cThe fearlessness of emboldened alcoholics allowed to shout into the void in a small, nicotine-stained green room.\u201d That gets to the force of Bacon\u2019s art; perhaps even to the composition and colour. The viridian green of the Colony Room seeps, particularly, into images of Peter Lacy, described as the love of Bacon\u2019s life. Not that you have any true sense of that relationship from the small range of closeup heads presented here. Uneasy, harrowing, claustrophobic: that\u2019s what people say about his art. And at one point Bacon himself is quoted as wondering whether Lacy\u2019s neurosis has somehow crept into the pictures. But how can anyone really tell, when he is as compacted and distorted as everyone else? And what about the ebullience, energy and overwhelming beauty of Bacon\u2019s art? One revelation of this show may be the significance of colour. Bacon was a sensationally gifted colourist: a sumptuous cobalt blue pours from the bottom of one painting; mauve, gold and papal purple glow from another; scarlet and orange burn so hot they light up the mood as well as the gallery. And Bacon seems to use different palettes for his lovers. He so admired George Dyer\u2019s profile that he made a template to reuse; you see it against midnight blackness, but also against an alizarin crimson that seeps like spilt blood into the canvas, especially in the final triptych of Dyer\u2019s suicide. The curators seem to want us to discover biography, incident and narrative in these paintings; but such interpretations feel like overlay. If Bacon can base his image of Lucian Freud on a photograph of Franz Kafka, something more (or less) than a portrait is being made. And if one of his own self-portraits incorporates Freud\u2019s body then literal appearance is not at stake. The relationship of these paintings to likeness lies, instead, in their radical similarity to each other at their best \u2013 images of life forces so zestful, original and wild they hold their own outside the old conventions of portraiture. Just in time for Halloween, the South Korean artist Mire Lee has filled the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern with ghosts and ghouls, in the shape of what she calls \u201cskins\u201d stretched tight on metal frames that dangle from the ceiling. Munch\u2019s The Scream, howling banshees, giant spiders, horror-shop masks and flailing spectres swing and flutter in the air. Each is the colour of dried blood, stained by the dye dripping like constant rain from a colossal turbine that slowly turns above us, draped in oozing, flapping tentacles. Panels explain the references to our industrial past, and the toll it takes on human beings. The skins apparently speak of our anatomy, rammed home by Lee\u2019s title: Open Wound. The whole installation will grow darker with the months, as the dye deepens in hue, and \u2013 it is presumably hoped \u2013 the metaphorical meaning with it. It rains, it churns; the skins shiver and multiply. There are 98 of them now, increasing to 150 by next March. But I cannot imagine that the numbers will matter. Nothing looked more fascinating in closeup, nothing developed, nothing further presented itself to eye, ear or mind than the spectacle of it all on entry, which was sheer mechanical hokum.

      "body": "<p>It is billed as a cheap way to travel the world \u2013 staying for free in strangers\u2019 homes in exchange for looking after their pets. But the world\u2019s biggest housesitting company has been accused of encouraging its members to flout visa rules by providing misleading travel advice.</p> <p>In some cases, members of TrustedHousesitters were detained and deported after arriving for international housesitting jobs without work visas, leaving them out of pocket and facing difficulties travelling in future.</p> <p>TrustedHousesitters, which is based in the UK and was recently valued at \u00a3100m, charges housesitters \u00a3131 a year to use its platform. It lists thousands of opportunities to \u201cstay for free with adorable animals in unique homes around the world\u201d.</p> <p>Advertised with the catchline \u201cthe freedom to travel\u201d, it provides members with letters they can show immigration officers, suggesting that because housesits are not paid, they do not need a work visa.</p> <p>The letters claim housesitters can travel to countries such as the UK, US, Australia and Canada as tourists or visitors, where they exchange \u201cpassionate pet care for free accommodation\u201d.</p> <p>But the <em>Observer</em> has spoken to TrustedHousesitters members who fell foul of immigration rules after arriving for international housesits as tourists \u2013 only to be told that it was unauthorised work.</p> <p>While housesitting through TrustedHousesitters is not paid, housesitters receive payment in kind in the form of free accommodation. They provide a service that homeowners would otherwise need to pay for \u2013 often including pet care and chores like collecting post or watering plants.</p> <p>TrustedHousesitters said it had been advised by immigration lawyers that its members were travelling for leisure purposes and not to work. It said only a \u201ctiny handful\u201d of its members had experienced problems, with data suggesting there were about 10 cases of border problems in 2023.</p> <p>But housesitters prevented from entering the US and UK \u2013 the two most popular destinations \u2013 have accused the company of misleading members and \u201cburying its head in the sand\u201d.</p> <p>Madolline Gourley, 34, from Brisbane, Australia, said she lost more than 5,000 Australian dollars (\u00a32,584.50) after she was detained and deported while trying to transit through the US on her way to a catsitting job in Canada in 2022. Paperwork given to her by US immigration officials shows they considered her unpaid housesitting to be \u201cunauthorised employment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t ever go back to the US as a tourist. I can\u2019t even transit through the US any more,\u201d said Gourley, who works in government communications.</p>    <p>She called it a \u201cbig red flag\u201d in the company\u2019s business model and is campaigning for UK regulators to intervene. \u201cI have suffered serious consequences because I didn\u2019t know I needed a work visa, but TrustedHousesitters are still allowed to operate and promote this like, \u2018travel anywhere you want in the world with pets and a free place to stay!\u2019. There are no consequences for the company, but there are plenty of consequences for the housesitter.\u201d</p> <p>In another case, Gemma Bailey, 45, from Hemel Hempstead, said she got a call from the UK Border Force telling her that her American housesitter had been stopped while trying to enter the UK. Bailey, a therapist, was due to fly to Bulgaria on holiday the next morning and had arranged for the housesitter to look after her cat.</p> <p>\u201cThey said, \u2018Have you got this lady coming to stay with you?\u2019 and I said \u2018yes\u2019 and they said \u2018why?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Because I\u2019m going on holiday in the morning and she\u2019s coming to look after my cat\u2019,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cAnd they said, \u2018Well no, she isn\u2019t, because this isn\u2019t legal.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThey said she was going to be detained and they would make a decision about whether to deport her. They had fingerprinted her. She felt very aggrieved because she had been treated like a criminal.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cTrustedHousesitters need to accept that this is a legitimate issue and publicise it.\u201d</p> <p>TrustedHousesitters launched in 2010 and was acquired in December by London-based Mayfair Partners in a deal valuing it at \u00a3100m. This weekend, its website was listing 7,932 global housesitting opportunities. On Instagram, TrustedHousesitters has described petsitting as a \u201cworkation\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Michaela Benson, an expert in lifestyle migration at the University of Lancaster, said housesitting was a \u201cgrey area legally that needs to be addressed\u201d and that the company\u2019s marketing appeared to be \u201cplaying on the ambivalence of the situation\u201d. \u201cIt is misleading and I think that people are right to be upset, given how that is presented,\u201d she said.</p> <p>TrustedHousesitters\u2019 letters argue that unpaid housesitting is not a form of work so can be done by tourists or visitors. But the stance appears to contradict statements by UK and US government officials. A UK Home Office spokesperson said last year that it typically considers housesitting to be work, even if unpaid, and confirmed this position to the <em>Observer</em>. People trying to enter the US have been told by immigration officials that petsitting and housesitting in exchange for lodging is considered employment.</p> <p>Nicolette Bostock, head of UK immigration at international law firm Withers, said that while rules varied, it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that many countries would consider unpaid housesitting to be work. \u201cEven though there\u2019s no money changing hands, it\u2019s work,. It\u2019s not for free \u2013 there is a transaction happening in that there is an expectation ... between the housesitter and the house or pet owner, that defines what should be done, when and how, and what they get in exchange.\u201d</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe liability rests solely with the person seeking the entry \u2026 I would be wary of relying on those letters.\u201d </p> <p>Canadian housesitter Elyse Sevigny, 65, who showed a letter from TrustedHousesitters to border officials when attempting to travel to the US, said she felt it did \u201cmore harm than good\u201d.</p> <p>The nurse from Ottawa had been travelling for an unpaid dogsitting role in New Mexico in August 2023 when she was blocked from entering.</p> <p>She said the immigration officer \u201ccame up with the clause that free housing is considered remuneration and therefore I was going into the US to work and I was not allowed entry. I was fingerprinted, photographed and given all this documentation. I was quite shaken up,\u201d she said.</p> <p>After contacting TrustedHousesitters, it refunded part of her membership fee.</p> <p>In the TrustedHousesitters forum, which remains online, users encourage others to lie about their reasons for travel, and to say they are going to stay with a friend or family.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/21/housesitters-escaping-the-cost-of-living-crisis\">\u2018I\u2019m a homeless guy looking after a palace!\u2019 The housesitters escaping the cost of living crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>TrustedHousesitters is now facing scrutiny from UK trading standards officers, who are exploring potential breaches of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations.</p> <p>Councillor Jacob Taylor, deputy leader of Brighton and Hove council, said it had received several complaints from overseas and was investigating. \u201cWe have also referred the case to the Competition and Markets Authority\u201d</p> <p>The CMA said it could not comment and TrustedHousesitters said it had \u201cno record of any contact\u201d from the authority.

      "bodyText": "It is billed as a cheap way to travel the world \u2013 staying for free in strangers\u2019 homes in exchange for looking after their pets. But the world\u2019s biggest housesitting company has been accused of encouraging its members to flout visa rules by providing misleading travel advice. In some cases, members of TrustedHousesitters were detained and deported after arriving for international housesitting jobs without work visas, leaving them out of pocket and facing difficulties travelling in future. TrustedHousesitters, which is based in the UK and was recently valued at \u00a3100m, charges housesitters \u00a3131 a year to use its platform. It lists thousands of opportunities to \u201cstay for free with adorable animals in unique homes around the world\u201d. Advertised with the catchline \u201cthe freedom to travel\u201d, it provides members with letters they can show immigration officers, suggesting that because housesits are not paid, they do not need a work visa. The letters claim housesitters can travel to countries such as the UK, US, Australia and Canada as tourists or visitors, where they exchange \u201cpassionate pet care for free accommodation\u201d. But the Observer has spoken to TrustedHousesitters members who fell foul of immigration rules after arriving for international housesits as tourists \u2013 only to be told that it was unauthorised work. While housesitting through TrustedHousesitters is not paid, housesitters receive payment in kind in the form of free accommodation. They provide a service that homeowners would otherwise need to pay for \u2013 often including pet care and chores like collecting post or watering plants. TrustedHousesitters said it had been advised by immigration lawyers that its members were travelling for leisure purposes and not to work. It said only a \u201ctiny handful\u201d of its members had experienced problems, with data suggesting there were about 10 cases of border problems in 2023. But housesitters prevented from entering the US and UK \u2013 the two most popular destinations \u2013 have accused the company of misleading members and \u201cburying its head in the sand\u201d. Madolline Gourley, 34, from Brisbane, Australia, said she lost more than 5,000 Australian dollars (\u00a32,584.50) after she was detained and deported while trying to transit through the US on her way to a catsitting job in Canada in 2022. Paperwork given to her by US immigration officials shows they considered her unpaid housesitting to be \u201cunauthorised employment\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t ever go back to the US as a tourist. I can\u2019t even transit through the US any more,\u201d said Gourley, who works in government communications. She called it a \u201cbig red flag\u201d in the company\u2019s business model and is campaigning for UK regulators to intervene. \u201cI have suffered serious consequences because I didn\u2019t know I needed a work visa, but TrustedHousesitters are still allowed to operate and promote this like, \u2018travel anywhere you want in the world with pets and a free place to stay!\u2019. There are no consequences for the company, but there are plenty of consequences for the housesitter.\u201d In another case, Gemma Bailey, 45, from Hemel Hempstead, said she got a call from the UK Border Force telling her that her American housesitter had been stopped while trying to enter the UK. Bailey, a therapist, was due to fly to Bulgaria on holiday the next morning and had arranged for the housesitter to look after her cat. \u201cThey said, \u2018Have you got this lady coming to stay with you?\u2019 and I said \u2018yes\u2019 and they said \u2018why?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Because I\u2019m going on holiday in the morning and she\u2019s coming to look after my cat\u2019,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cAnd they said, \u2018Well no, she isn\u2019t, because this isn\u2019t legal.\u2019 \u201cThey said she was going to be detained and they would make a decision about whether to deport her. They had fingerprinted her. She felt very aggrieved because she had been treated like a criminal.\u201d She added: \u201cTrustedHousesitters need to accept that this is a legitimate issue and publicise it.\u201d TrustedHousesitters launched in 2010 and was acquired in December by London-based Mayfair Partners in a deal valuing it at \u00a3100m. This weekend, its website was listing 7,932 global housesitting opportunities. On Instagram, TrustedHousesitters has described petsitting as a \u201cworkation\u201d. Prof Michaela Benson, an expert in lifestyle migration at the University of Lancaster, said housesitting was a \u201cgrey area legally that needs to be addressed\u201d and that the company\u2019s marketing appeared to be \u201cplaying on the ambivalence of the situation\u201d. \u201cIt is misleading and I think that people are right to be upset, given how that is presented,\u201d she said. TrustedHousesitters\u2019 letters argue that unpaid housesitting is not a form of work so can be done by tourists or visitors. But the stance appears to contradict statements by UK and US government officials. A UK Home Office spokesperson said last year that it typically considers housesitting to be work, even if unpaid, and confirmed this position to the Observer. People trying to enter the US have been told by immigration officials that petsitting and housesitting in exchange for lodging is considered employment. Nicolette Bostock, head of UK immigration at international law firm Withers, said that while rules varied, it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that many countries would consider unpaid housesitting to be work. \u201cEven though there\u2019s no money changing hands, it\u2019s work,. It\u2019s not for free \u2013 there is a transaction happening in that there is an expectation ... between the housesitter and the house or pet owner, that defines what should be done, when and how, and what they get in exchange.\u201d She said: \u201cThe liability rests solely with the person seeking the entry \u2026 I would be wary of relying on those letters.\u201d Canadian housesitter Elyse Sevigny, 65, who showed a letter from TrustedHousesitters to border officials when attempting to travel to the US, said she felt it did \u201cmore harm than good\u201d. The nurse from Ottawa had been travelling for an unpaid dogsitting role in New Mexico in August 2023 when she was blocked from entering. She said the immigration officer \u201ccame up with the clause that free housing is considered remuneration and therefore I was going into the US to work and I was not allowed entry. I was fingerprinted, photographed and given all this documentation. I was quite shaken up,\u201d she said. After contacting TrustedHousesitters, it refunded part of her membership fee. In the TrustedHousesitters forum, which remains online, users encourage others to lie about their reasons for travel, and to say they are going to stay with a friend or family. TrustedHousesitters is now facing scrutiny from UK trading standards officers, who are exploring potential breaches of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations. Councillor Jacob Taylor, deputy leader of Brighton and Hove council, said it had received several complaints from overseas and was investigating. \u201cWe have also referred the case to the Competition and Markets Authority\u201d The CMA said it could not comment and TrustedHousesitters said it had \u201cno record of any contact\u201d from the authority. A spokesperson for the company said it regretted the challenges that \u201ca handful\u201d of its members had faced and provided support \u201cwhen such rare instances occur\u201d. It publishes guidance on its website which states that housesitters should verify all personal requirements before travelling and that its immigration letters \u201cdo not guarantee entry to a country\u201d. The spokesperson added: \u201cTrustedHousesitters does not provide opportunities for work and has been consistently advised by international immigration lawyers that our members are travelling for leisure purposes, not work.\u201d Gourley, the Australian woman turned away at the US border, said: \u201cI am shocked none of the government agencies are doing anything about it. The only ones penalised are the foreign travellers who don\u2019t know any better.\u201d",

Megan Thee Stallion) - Cardi B</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Ellie, who is all of four years old, owes a great debt to Shana Stephenson, the Liberty\u2019s chief brand officer. Working with the team\u2019s chief executive, Keia Clarke, Stephenson conceptualized the mascot when the team moved from Madison Square Garden across the East River to the $1bn Barclays Center and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maddieliberty\">Maddie</a>, the golden retriever mascot named after the previous home arena, had to be put down. So Stephenson enlisted a slew of artists to propose sketches for an outer-borough mascot who was an elephant, a tribute to PT Barnum\u2019s great elephant parade across the Brooklyn Bridge in 1884. Criscia Long, the Liberty\u2019s senior director of entertainment who helps coordinate Ellie\u2019s game-day performances, rounded off the all-Black creative team behind what soon would become the most talked-about mascot in professional sports.</p> \n<p>It was essential that Ellie embody Brooklyn and, given that she was representing a WNBA team, that she be an ur-woman (fur woman?). \u201cWe really wanted Ellie to be feminine,\u201d said Stephenson, who was part of a group of Liberty executives who took to social media and reached out to casting directors to hold auditions, then met with a gamut of local performers who shared their interpretations of what Ellie could be. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really share that much information about Ellie, we really wanted them as creatives, as entertainers, as performers, to help us define what a New York Liberty mascot could represent,\u201d she added. \u201cWe wanted someone who could dance and entertain and if they had athleticism, that would be fantastic, but it wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p> \n<p>That Ellie not feel like a ripoff of other mascots was key. \u201cSome mascots can be dopey or goofy or kind of clumsy,\u201d said Stephenson. \u201cEllie is sassy. Ellie is friendly. Ellie is entertaining. She\u2019s full of attitude, she\u2019s multi-faceted, and she\u2019s stylish. I would describe Ellie as a fashionista and an athlete and a dancer. She\u2019s <em>that</em> girl.\u201d</p> \n<p>Just who that handbag-toting girl is, though, remains a tightly guarded secret. Team officials will not disclose Ellie\u2019s true identity \u2013 and insist that the players don\u2019t know either. They will share that Ellie is always played by the same human. A true artist, the mystery performer collaborates on all dimensions of her persona and shenanigans. \u201cEllie definitely has input on how she shows up,\u201d said Stephenson. \u201cAnd I love that about Ellie, because she\u2019s not someone that we just dictate to and say: You\u2019re going to wear this or you need to dance to this song. She\u2019s very much involved in the vision.\u201d</p> \n<p>Part of that vision includes involving fans of all ages. \u201cRegardless of if you\u2019re a little girl or 45-year-old woman, Ellie is able to connect with you,\u201d said Stephenson. \u201cOur players are so nice and approachable and accessible. And I think that that\u2019s really what makes our team unique. And I think something that makes Ellie special is she has a sense of humor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ellie worked her magic throughout last month\u2019s semi-final opener, eliciting a chorus of \u201cI love you, Ellie!\u201d from a gaggle of women seated in a private box. When Slick Rick came onto the court at half-time to perform his 80s hit Mona Lisa, the flirtatious fashionista was dancing like nobody\u2019s business. When the players returned to the court for the third quarter, Ellie was far from done pumping up the crowd. She strutted from seat to seat and flipped her braid for a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wnba/reel/DAg8tnOR8v_/?hl=en\">star-flecked crowd</a> that included Spike Lee, Jason Sudeikis, Tracy Morgan and celebrity chef Kwame Onwuachi.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe amps up the energy,\u201d said Dana Nathanson, a 27-year-old Brooklynite and hardcore Liberty fan. \u201cAll throughout the game she is running up and down the arena, dancing to Missy Elliott, and she\u2019ll have eight outfit changes.\u201d Aria McManus, a 35-year-old artist and basketball obsessive who runs Downtown Girls, a pickup league for women and nonbinary people, credits Ellie with the Liberty fever that has swept her cohort. \u201cWhen the Liberty first came to Barclays, there weren\u2019t enough ticket sales so they covered the top seats with a black curtain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe games are so fun. It\u2019s very wholesome and spirited and there are so many women and so many little girls. Something about watching Ellie do the splits keeps the energy up \u2013 even if they\u2019re losing.\u201d</p> \n<p>That hasn\u2019t been a common occurrence for the Liberty of late. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/18/las-vegas-aces-new-york-liberty-wnba-finals-report\">coming up two wins short of the title</a> last October, New York coasted to the WNBA\u2019s best regular-season record to earn the top seed in this year\u2019s playoffs, where they breezed past the the Atlanta Dream and dethroned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/07/las-vegas-aces-dynasty-new-york-liberty-wnba-playoffs\">the two-time defending champion Aces</a> to book a return trip to the finals against the Minnesota Lynx, which tipped off on Thursday night in Brooklyn. It\u2019s a national platform that Ellie will no doubt make her personal Met Gala \u2013 she <a href=\"https://x.com/espnW/status/184450856612576902a5\">rolled up to Game 1</a> wearing a custom puffer with Timbs and a Telfar \u2013 as the Liberty look to become the first men\u2019s or women\u2019s basketball team from New York to raise a banner since the NBA\u2019s Knicks back in 1973.</p> \n<p>Though nobody can say for sure who Ellie is, many of her fans regard her as a queer Black icon. (The <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bigellieliberty/video/7379006720263081259\">occasional voiceover</a> on Ellie\u2019s TikTok and Instagram accounts is reminiscent of Wanda Sykes.) \u201cMy friend who had season tickets got close to Ellie and screamed out to her: \u2018Are you gay?\u2019\u201d said Agnes Walden, a 29-year-old artist who lives in Brooklyn. \u201cAnd Ellie turned to her and made the rainbow symbol with her hands.\u201d</p>",

Not since Miss Piggy has a fuzzy creation reached this level of modern womanhood. Ellie, who is all of four years old, owes a great debt to Shana Stephenson, the Liberty\u2019s chief brand officer. Working with the team\u2019s chief executive, Keia Clarke, Stephenson conceptualized the mascot when the team moved from Madison Square Garden across the East River to the $1bn Barclays Center and Maddie, the golden retriever mascot named after the previous home arena, had to be put down. So Stephenson enlisted a slew of artists to propose sketches for an outer-borough mascot who was an elephant, a tribute to PT Barnum\u2019s great elephant parade across the Brooklyn Bridge in 1884. Criscia Long, the Liberty\u2019s senior director of entertainment who helps coordinate Ellie\u2019s game-day performances, rounded off the all-Black creative team behind what soon would become the most talked-about mascot in professional sports. It was essential that Ellie embody Brooklyn and, given that she was representing a WNBA team, that she be an ur-woman (fur woman?). \u201cWe really wanted Ellie to be feminine,\u201d said Stephenson, who was part of a group of Liberty executives who took to social media and reached out to casting directors to hold auditions, then met with a gamut of local performers who shared their interpretations of what Ellie could be. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really share that much information about Ellie, we really wanted them as creatives, as entertainers, as performers, to help us define what a New York Liberty mascot could represent,\u201d she added. \u201cWe wanted someone who could dance and entertain and if they had athleticism, that would be fantastic, but it wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d That Ellie not feel like a ripoff of other mascots was key. \u201cSome mascots can be dopey or goofy or kind of clumsy,\u201d said Stephenson. \u201cEllie is sassy. Ellie is friendly. Ellie is entertaining. She\u2019s full of attitude, she\u2019s multi-faceted, and she\u2019s stylish. I would describe Ellie as a fashionista and an athlete and a dancer. She\u2019s that girl.\u201d Just who that handbag-toting girl is, though, remains a tightly guarded secret. Team officials will not disclose Ellie\u2019s true identity \u2013 and insist that the players don\u2019t know either. They will share that Ellie is always played by the same human. A true artist, the mystery performer collaborates on all dimensions of her persona and shenanigans. \u201cEllie definitely has input on how she shows up,\u201d said Stephenson. \u201cAnd I love that about Ellie, because she\u2019s not someone that we just dictate to and say: You\u2019re going to wear this or you need to dance to this song. She\u2019s very much involved in the vision.\u201d Part of that vision includes involving fans of all ages. \u201cRegardless of if you\u2019re a little girl or 45-year-old woman, Ellie is able to connect with you,\u201d said Stephenson. \u201cOur players are so nice and approachable and accessible. And I think that that\u2019s really what makes our team unique. And I think something that makes Ellie special is she has a sense of humor.\u201d Ellie worked her magic throughout last month\u2019s semi-final opener, eliciting a chorus of \u201cI love you, Ellie!\u201d from a gaggle of women seated in a private box. When Slick Rick came onto the court at half-time to perform his 80s hit Mona Lisa, the flirtatious fashionista was dancing like nobody\u2019s business. When the players returned to the court for the third quarter, Ellie was far from done pumping up the crowd. She strutted from seat to seat and flipped her braid for a star-flecked crowd that included Spike Lee, Jason Sudeikis, Tracy Morgan and celebrity chef Kwame Onwuachi. \u201cShe amps up the energy,\u201d said Dana Nathanson, a 27-year-old Brooklynite and hardcore Liberty fan. \u201cAll throughout the game she is running up and down the arena, dancing to Missy Elliott, and she\u2019ll have eight outfit changes.\u201d Aria McManus, a 35-year-old artist and basketball obsessive who runs Downtown Girls, a pickup league for women and nonbinary people, credits Ellie with the Liberty fever that has swept her cohort. \u201cWhen the Liberty first came to Barclays, there weren\u2019t enough ticket sales so they covered the top seats with a black curtain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe games are so fun. It\u2019s very wholesome and spirited and there are so many women and so many little girls. Something about watching Ellie do the splits keeps the energy up \u2013 even if they\u2019re losing.\u201d That hasn\u2019t been a common occurrence for the Liberty of late. After coming up two wins short of the title last October, New York coasted to the WNBA\u2019s best regular-season record to earn the top seed in this year\u2019s playoffs, where they breezed past the the Atlanta Dream and dethroned the two-time defending champion Aces to book a return trip to the finals against the Minnesota Lynx, which tipped off on Thursday night in Brooklyn. It\u2019s a national platform that Ellie will no doubt make her personal Met Gala \u2013 she rolled up to Game 1 wearing a custom puffer with Timbs and a Telfar \u2013 as the Liberty look to become the first men\u2019s or women\u2019s basketball team from New York to raise a banner since the NBA\u2019s Knicks back in 1973. Though nobody can say for sure who Ellie is, many of her fans regard her as a queer Black icon. (The occasional voiceover on Ellie\u2019s TikTok and Instagram accounts is reminiscent of Wanda Sykes.) \u201cMy friend who had season tickets got close to Ellie and screamed out to her: \u2018Are you gay?\u2019\u201d said Agnes Walden, a 29-year-old artist who lives in Brooklyn. \u201cAnd Ellie turned to her and made the rainbow symbol with her hands.\u201d",

Built on the boggy bed of a drained loch in the late 18th and early 19th century, the artificial mound connected the city\u2019s medieval Old Town with the burgeoning prosperity of the New Town, transforming the Scottish capital. The origins are said to have been laid in the 1770s by a tartan salesman called George Boyd, who \u2013 seeking a shortcut across the swampy ground to the elegant new buildings rising up next to it \u2013 put down stepping stones and planks, creating a path known as Geordie Boyd\u2019s Mud Brig. Historians previously thought Old Town residents then built up the path in an ad hoc manner over 50 years, by dumping their household waste there, along with cartloads of earth and rubble from New Town construction sites. Eventually, it was thought, this huge rubbish tip grew to become the Mound. Now, new evidence suggests the town council actively regulated and oversaw the remarkable construction of the Mound from local rubbish. As the land is now a world heritage site, with Victorian railway tunnels underneath and category A-listed buildings above, archeologists have had little opportunity to investigate the accuracy of its oft-repeated origin story. However, the Observer can reveal that a rare archeological study commissioned during excavation works by the National Galleries of Scotland, which opened a new site on the Mound last year, found very little household rubbish, food or organic waste present. Instead, the study by Addyman Archaeology indicates that the town council systematically supervised the dumping of certain waste \u2013 ceramics, oyster shells, clay pipes, glass, tiles, bricks and other demolition debris \u2013 into well-ordered deposits that were channelled into carefully managed zones and placed in defined locations. \u201cIt would have been in the council\u2019s interests to ensure the rubbish laid down was clean waste \u2013 so non-organic matter,\u201d said Dr Patricia Allerston, curator at National Galleries of Scotland. \u201cIt must have been quite an operation.

Both 17th and 18th century bricks have been found, suggesting some of the rubble came from construction sites in the Old Town where buildings were being demolished. The revelations shed light on the history of Edinburgh, indicating that as the city grew, forward-thinking town planners took pains to ensure residents and builders repurposed and recycled their waste in the most efficient way. \u201cThe surprise of this study was that it showed civic organisation, perhaps earlier in this area than was anticipated,\u201d said Allerston. Art historians have been able to reinterpret contemporary paintings and drawings of the Mound, which are on display in the new galleries built upon it, in the light of the new discoveries.

      "body": "<p>Two of England\u2019s biggest water firms dumped raw sewage into rivers across the country in suspected illegal breaches of their permits, despite being given the highest possible rating by the regulator for their environmental performance, the <em>Observer</em> can reveal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/severntrent\">Severn Trent Water</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/unitedutilities\">United Utilities</a> were responsible for 1,374 raw sewage spills from sewage treatment works in apparent breaches of permits over a two-year period in more than 80 watercourses, according to an analysis of previously unpublished operational data. It is alleged the suspected illegal discharges were during dry weather or at times when the plants were not at operating capacity.</p> <p>The two firms were both given the four-star rating by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment-agency\">Environment Agency</a> this year for their performance in 2023. Over the past five years, the firms have paid out a combined \u00a32.8bn in dividends to shareholders and millions of pounds in bonuses to bosses, with both repeatedly citing their top ratings from the regulator.</p> <p>In response to the revelations, Emma Hardy, the water minister, said: \u201cFor too long, water companies have pumped record levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas. This government will never let this happen again.\u201d</p> <p>Ashley Smith, founder of the campaign group <a href=\"https://www.windrushwasp.org/\">Windrush Against Sewage Pollution</a> (Wasp), which conducted the studies, said it was shocking the two firms had been given the top rating while apparently \u201cpermitting illegal discharges on a massive scale\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThese environmental performance assessments lie at the heart of the deceit that has allowed the privatised water industry to pay huge dividends and bonuses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-2-zip/giv-4559pIqN5F6cPiHm/\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-2-zip/giv-4559pIqN5F6cPiHm/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey have been a tick box exercise, providing a cover for profiteering and regulatory failure. It is a national disgrace.\u201d The water firms say the findings are based on \u201cassumptions\u201d and consider them unreliable.</p> <p>The Environment Agency provides an annual assessment of the environmental performance of the nine water and sewerage companies operating in England. Severn Trent has been given the highest rating five years in a row. United Utilities was given the top rating for the years 2020, 2021 and 2023.</p> <p>In response to the new findings, the agency said a four-star rating does not mean a firm is a \u201cperfect performer\u201d. It also said it was consulting on changes to the environmental performance assessments.</p> <p>An agency spokesperson said: \u201cOverall water company performance, including for Severn Trent and United Utilities, isn\u2019t where it needs to be and a major area for company improvement is in stopping unacceptable \u2018dry day spills\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Water firms have faced public fury after it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/water-firms-raw-sewage-england-rivers\">first revealed by the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/water-firms-raw-sewage-england-rivers\">Guardian</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/water-firms-raw-sewage-england-rivers\"> in July 2020</a> that they had discharged raw sewage into England\u2019s rivers on more than 200,000 occasions in just one year.</p>    <p>The firms are permitted to discharge raw sewage at times of heavy rainfall, but the latest analysis examines potentially illegal spills. The rivers campaign group Wasp matched rainfall records against the water firms\u2019 operational data for their sewage treatment works (2021-2022) and regulatory permits to expose the scale of the suspected illegal discharges.</p> <p>Its analysis found that Severn Trent had made 494 suspected illegal spills of sewage in 2021 and 309 in 2022 from 50 sewage plants. One sewage treatment works at the village of Colwall in Herefordshire discharged 72 times in suspected breach of permit conditions in 2021 and 2022.</p> <p>A treatment works at Derby appears to have illegally discharged sewage into the River Derwent on 35 days over the two-year period, according to the data. There were also suspected illegal spills into the Severn, the Trent and the Cam in Gloucestershire.</p> <p>Wasp\u2019s analysis of United Utilities found the firm had made 308 suspected illegal spills in 2021 and 263 in 2022 from 35 sewage plants. At a sewage works at Newbiggin on Morecambe Bay, which is designated a special area of conservation, there were 84 suspected illegal discharges in 2021 and 2022.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s only through the relentless work of citizen scientists that we now know about the state of our rivers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Peter Hammond, the author of Wasp\u2019s reports, said there may have been hundreds of other illegal spills by the companies, but the data from the recording equipment in those cases could not be considered robust enough to distinguish between legal and illegal spills. Hammond said that the government \u201cmust replace current devices with flow meters to record frequency, duration and volume\u201d. Any bonuses based on unreliable environmental data should be clawed back, he said.</p> <p>Hammond and Smith, who have been labelled the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/04/sewage-sleuths-river-pollution-slow-dirty-death-of-welsh-and-english-rivers\">\u201csewage sleuths\u201d,</a> previously used machine learning to detect untracked sewage discharges, with a paper published in March 2021. Eight months later, the Environment Agency announced its biggest criminal investigation into potential breaches of environmental conditions at sewage treatment works.</p> <p>Ofwat, the industry regulator, last week ordered water firms to return \u00a3158m to customers through bills because of poor performance.

      "bodyText": "Two of England\u2019s biggest water firms dumped raw sewage into rivers across the country in suspected illegal breaches of their permits, despite being given the highest possible rating by the regulator for their environmental performance, the Observer can reveal. Severn Trent Water and United Utilities were responsible for 1,374 raw sewage spills from sewage treatment works in apparent breaches of permits over a two-year period in more than 80 watercourses, according to an analysis of previously unpublished operational data. It is alleged the suspected illegal discharges were during dry weather or at times when the plants were not at operating capacity. The two firms were both given the four-star rating by the Environment Agency this year for their performance in 2023. Over the past five years, the firms have paid out a combined \u00a32.8bn in dividends to shareholders and millions of pounds in bonuses to bosses, with both repeatedly citing their top ratings from the regulator. In response to the revelations, Emma Hardy, the water minister, said: \u201cFor too long, water companies have pumped record levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas. This government will never let this happen again.\u201d Ashley Smith, founder of the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (Wasp), which conducted the studies, said it was shocking the two firms had been given the top rating while apparently \u201cpermitting illegal discharges on a massive scale\u201d. He said: \u201cThese environmental performance assessments lie at the heart of the deceit that has allowed the privatised water industry to pay huge dividends and bonuses. \u201cThey have been a tick box exercise, providing a cover for profiteering and regulatory failure. It is a national disgrace.\u201d The water firms say the findings are based on \u201cassumptions\u201d and consider them unreliable. The Environment Agency provides an annual assessment of the environmental performance of the nine water and sewerage companies operating in England. Severn Trent has been given the highest rating five years in a row. United Utilities was given the top rating for the years 2020, 2021 and 2023. In response to the new findings, the agency said a four-star rating does not mean a firm is a \u201cperfect performer\u201d. It also said it was consulting on changes to the environmental performance assessments. An agency spokesperson said: \u201cOverall water company performance, including for Severn Trent and United Utilities, isn\u2019t where it needs to be and a major area for company improvement is in stopping unacceptable \u2018dry day spills\u2019\u201d. Water firms have faced public fury after it was first revealed by the Guardian in July 2020 that they had discharged raw sewage into England\u2019s rivers on more than 200,000 occasions in just one year. The firms are permitted to discharge raw sewage at times of heavy rainfall, but the latest analysis examines potentially illegal spills. The rivers campaign group Wasp matched rainfall records against the water firms\u2019 operational data for their sewage treatment works (2021-2022) and regulatory permits to expose the scale of the suspected illegal discharges. Its analysis found that Severn Trent had made 494 suspected illegal spills of sewage in 2021 and 309 in 2022 from 50 sewage plants. One sewage treatment works at the village of Colwall in Herefordshire discharged 72 times in suspected breach of permit conditions in 2021 and 2022. A treatment works at Derby appears to have illegally discharged sewage into the River Derwent on 35 days over the two-year period, according to the data. There were also suspected illegal spills into the Severn, the Trent and the Cam in Gloucestershire. Wasp\u2019s analysis of United Utilities found the firm had made 308 suspected illegal spills in 2021 and 263 in 2022 from 35 sewage plants. At a sewage works at Newbiggin on Morecambe Bay, which is designated a special area of conservation, there were 84 suspected illegal discharges in 2021 and 2022. Peter Hammond, the author of Wasp\u2019s reports, said there may have been hundreds of other illegal spills by the companies, but the data from the recording equipment in those cases could not be considered robust enough to distinguish between legal and illegal spills. Hammond said that the government \u201cmust replace current devices with flow meters to record frequency, duration and volume\u201d. Any bonuses based on unreliable environmental data should be clawed back, he said. Hammond and Smith, who have been labelled the \u201csewage sleuths\u201d, previously used machine learning to detect untracked sewage discharges, with a paper published in March 2021. Eight months later, the Environment Agency announced its biggest criminal investigation into potential breaches of environmental conditions at sewage treatment works. Ofwat, the industry regulator, last week ordered water firms to return \u00a3158m to customers through bills because of poor performance. Severn Trent and United Utilities, however, were reported to have exceeded their targets and will be able to charge customers more next year. Charles Watson, chair of the charity River Action, said: \u201cIt\u2019s only through the relentless work of citizen scientists that we now know about the state of our rivers while our regulators have been missing in action. The fact that any dividends and bonuses have been paid by firms complicit in persistent widespread illegal activities is an outrage.\u201d Liv Garfield, chief executive of Severn Trent, was given a \u00a33.2m pay deal in 2023/24, including a bonus of \u00a3584,000. Louise Beardmore, chief executive of United Utilities, was paid \u00a31.4m in the year to 31 March 2024, including a \u00a3420,000 annual bonus. A United Utilities spokesperson said: \u201cThe methodology used in this report is not one that is used by regulators or companies and continues to be based on assumptions rather than actual evidence or measured data.\u201d The spokesperson said it understood people\u2019s concerns about sewage discharges and had embarked on the \u201clargest environmental investment in a century\u201d in its infrastructure. Severn Trent said: \u201cOur sites have complex hydraulic configurations with multiple interdependencies that need to be assessed using site specific assured data, whereas desktop analysis like this can only produce assumptions and unreliable conclusions. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress to improve river health and an extra \u00a31bn raised by our investors is accelerating delivery, with \u00a3450m being invested this year alone to reduce spills.\u201d The firm said it considered the works at Colwall was operating \u201cin line with its permits\u201d, and that the Environment Agency performance assessments were \u201cchallenging and intensive\u201d and it was the only water firm to achieve the highest rating five years in a row. A government spokesperson said a new water bill going through parliament will strengthen regulation, including the powers to ban the payment of bonuses to bosses of polluting firms. It will also conduct a review of the water sector. A spokesperson for Water UK, the trade association for the industry, said: \u201cNo sewage spill is ever acceptable, and we have a plan to put it right. Water companies have proposed investing \u00a311bn to reduce spills by 40% by 2030. We now need Ofwat to give us the green light so we can get on with it.\u201d",

So successful was this strategy that Hamas swept to power in Gaza in 2006, and the Palestinian Authority was cut in two, with Hamas controlling Gaza and Fatah the West Bank.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Israel had helped nurture [Hamas] for the explicit aim of denying Palestinians a state</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/\">the</a><em><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/\"> Times of Israel</a></em><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/\"> observed</a>, \u201cIsrael has allowed suitcases holding millions in Qatari cash to enter Gaza through its crossings since 2018\u201d, while practically turning \u201ca blind eye to the incendiary balloons and rocket fire from Gaza\u201d. On 7 October, it added on the day after the slaughter: \u201cThe concept of indirectly strengthening Hamas went up in smoke.\u201d</p> <p>Hamas was responsible for the butchery of 7 October. But Israel had helped nurture it for the explicit aim of denying Palestinians a state. And now, in the attempt to undo its previous work, it has laid Gaza to waste. Israel has to enforce \u201canother Nakba [catastrophe]\u201d, Hacohen insists. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.israelhayom.com/2023/10/28/the-original-sin-how-israel-let-hamas-grow/\">The Gazans have to be expelled</a> from their homes for good.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, however cynical it may have been, there was nothing exceptional about Israel\u2019s strategy. For decades, western governments sought to exploit Islam to help pursue their political ends, from the funding of international jihadists to drive out the Red Army in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion of 1979 to secular France <a href=\"https://www.editionspoints.com/ouvrage/les-banlieues-de-l-islam-gilles-kepel/9782757853450\">encouraging the building of prayer rooms</a> in factories, regarding Islam, in the words of Paul Dijoud, immigration minister in Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing\u2019s government, as a \u201cstabilising factor which would turn the faithful from deviance, delinquency, or membership of unions or revolutionary parties\u201d. Such policies often created a space in which more radical Islamist movements could flourish. We are still living with the blowback from this strategy.</p> <p>Netanyahu\u2019s aim in expanding Israel\u2019s wars, and in threatening to turn Lebanon into another Gaza, is not to \u201cliberate\u201d anything or anyone but to maintain control, internally and externally. The lessons of previous invasions of Lebanon \u2013 in 1978, 1982 and 2006 \u2013 should be clear enough. On the first two occasions, Israel invaded to confront the Palestine Liberation Organisation, on the third to try to eliminate Hezbollah, which had emerged, with Iranian backing, in response to the 1982 invasion and occupation. Each invasion was marked by considerable bloodshed \u2013 including, in 1982, the massacre of up to 3,500 Palestinians and Lebanese Shia in two Beirut refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila, by Israel\u2019s allies the Lebanese Christian Phalangist militia \u2013 and nothing that anyone could call \u201cliberation\u201d.</p> <p>There is a deeper issue here, too.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Israel is not invading Lebanon, it is liberating it.\u201d So proclaimed France\u2019s pre-eminent liberal philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy as Israeli tanks drove across the border and its war planes bombed villages in the south and residential districts in Beirut. \u201cThere are moments in history,\u201d he exulted, when \u201c\u2009\u2018escalation\u2019 becomes a necessity and a virtue.\u201d For L\u00e9vy, it is not just Lebanon that Israel is liberating, but much of the Middle East, too. L\u00e9vy is not alone in rejoicing at Israel\u2019s spreading military offensive. For many, Israel is waging war, not merely in \u201cself-defence\u201d but, in the words of president Isaac Herzog, \u201cto save western civilisation, to save the values of western civilisation\u201d, a claim echoed by many of its supporters. And the destruction of Gaza, of its hospitals and universities, and the killing of 40,000 people? And the 2,000 people killed in Lebanon in a fortnight, and the fifth of its population displaced? Collateral damage en route to saving civilisation. I should not need to say this but, as it has become commonplace to portray anyone criticising Israel\u2019s wars in Gaza and Lebanon as supporting Hamas or Hezbollah or celebrating the slaughter on 7 October last year, let me say that what Hamas did was barbarous, and that, as I wrote at the time, \u201cHamas represents a betrayal of Palestinian hopes as well as a threat to Jews\u201d. The same can be said of Hezbollah. And yet, until 7 October 2023, the prime minister of Israel, and much of his government, was far more supportive of Hamas than I was or would ever wish to be. \u201cAnyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu told a Likud meeting in 2019. \u201cTo prevent the option of two states,\u201d observed former Israeli general Gershon Hacohen, who for years backed Netanyahu\u2019s policy, \u201che is turning Hamas into his closest partner. Openly, Hamas is an enemy. Covertly, it\u2019s an ally.\u201d Israel\u2019s support for Hamas goes back decades, an \u201cattempt to divide and dilute support for a strong, secular PLO by using a competing religious alternative\u201d, as a senior CIA agent told UPI more than 20 years ago. So successful was this strategy that Hamas swept to power in Gaza in 2006, and the Palestinian Authority was cut in two, with Hamas controlling Gaza and Fatah the West Bank. In recent years, the Times of Israel observed, \u201cIsrael has allowed suitcases holding millions in Qatari cash to enter Gaza through its crossings since 2018\u201d, while practically turning \u201ca blind eye to the incendiary balloons and rocket fire from Gaza\u201d. On 7 October, it added on the day after the slaughter: \u201cThe concept of indirectly strengthening Hamas went up in smoke.\u201d Hamas was responsible for the butchery of 7 October. But Israel had helped nurture it for the explicit aim of denying Palestinians a state. And now, in the attempt to undo its previous work, it has laid Gaza to waste. Israel has to enforce \u201canother Nakba [catastrophe]\u201d, Hacohen insists. \u201cThe Gazans have to be expelled from their homes for good.\u201d Yet, however cynical it may have been, there was nothing exceptional about Israel\u2019s strategy. For decades, western governments sought to exploit Islam to help pursue their political ends, from the funding of international jihadists to drive out the Red Army in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion of 1979 to secular France encouraging the building of prayer rooms in factories, regarding Islam, in the words of Paul Dijoud, immigration minister in Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing\u2019s government, as a \u201cstabilising factor which would turn the faithful from deviance, delinquency, or membership of unions or revolutionary parties\u201d. Such policies often created a space in which more radical Islamist movements could flourish. We are still living with the blowback from this strategy. Netanyahu\u2019s aim in expanding Israel\u2019s wars, and in threatening to turn Lebanon into another Gaza, is not to \u201cliberate\u201d anything or anyone but to maintain control, internally and externally. The lessons of previous invasions of Lebanon \u2013 in 1978, 1982 and 2006 \u2013 should be clear enough. On the first two occasions, Israel invaded to confront the Palestine Liberation Organisation, on the third to try to eliminate Hezbollah, which had emerged, with Iranian backing, in response to the 1982 invasion and occupation. Each invasion was marked by considerable bloodshed \u2013 including, in 1982, the massacre of up to 3,500 Palestinians and Lebanese Shia in two Beirut refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila, by Israel\u2019s allies the Lebanese Christian Phalangist militia \u2013 and nothing that anyone could call \u201cliberation\u201d. There is a deeper issue here, too. In modernity, the historian Ronald Schechter wrote, \u201cJews became good to think [with]\u201d, a comment echoed by David Nirenberg who, in his classic history of \u201cAnti-Judaism\u201d, similarly observed that \u201cmodernity thinks with Judaism\u201d. What they meant was that the symbolic roles imposed on Jews became a means of addressing wider social issues. \u201cThe \u2018Jewish Question\u2019\u2009\u201d, Nirenberg wrote, is not \u201csimply an attitude towards Jews and their religion, but a way of critically engaging with the world\u201d. This use of \u201cthe Jew\u201d as a means of making sense of the world is most true, of course, of antisemitism. For antisemites, belief in mythical Jewish power explains the evils of the world. It is true also of many strands of philosemitism, a term coined originally by antisemites but which has come to be used more widely to describe the views of those who have particular admiration for the Jewish presence in the world.

If 7 October was an act of \u201cresistance\u201d, and if the destruction of Gaza and the brutalisation of Lebanon can be dismissed as essential steps towards a more civilised world, then I suggest we need to rethink what we mean by \u201cresistance\u201d and \u201ccivilisation\u201d. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "body": "<p>We know what\u2019s coming, we\u2019ve seen it before. Every October since 2007, bar a Covid hiatus, the London sporting scene gets infiltrated by an invasion from across the pond. The sporting superpower that is the National Football League comes to town and thousands of fans in garish, oversized jerseys can be seen wondering the streets. This year is no different: three games spread over three weekends, each one, whether it\u2019s at Wembley or Tottenham, packed to the rafters.</p> <p>But there is now another NFL London game, a fourth one, a match attended by maybe 2,000 people, but one that is a vital for the future global growth of American football. In fact you could argue it is far more important to the NFL than how many times Aaron Rodgers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/06/nfl-london-minnesota-vikings-new-york-jets-aaron-rodgers\">gets sacked by the Minnesota defence</a>. But this is a game played by a bunch of teenagers. On Tuesday night, just two days after the Jets and Vikings battled it out there, the Spurs Stadium saw the NFL Academy host one of the top American high schools, one rich in history and pedigree, the De La Salle Spartans.</p>    <ul> <li><p>The NFL Academy take on De La Salle Spartans at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p></li> </ul> <p>The first NFL Academy began life five years ago in the more humble surroundings of Barnet and Southgate College in north London. Set up as a major global initiative by the NFL, it aimed to provide full-time high-school education for 16- to 19-year-olds alongside intensive training in American football under the guidance of a world class coaching staff. At the same time as helping to develop the sport worldwide it was also designed to create a pathway for young international talent</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is football Hogwarts.</p> <footer> <cite>Kyle Brandt, co-host of Good Morning Football on the NFL Network</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not helped by the pandemic, the academy had a stuttering start and didn\u2019t have its first match until spring 2022, a game against D\u00fcsseldorf Panther in Germany. They were victorious then and have been unbeaten since against European teams, often winning by huge margins. But in summer 2022 the academy took a major step forward and decided to change locations, moving to the East Midlands and the elite athletic performance centre at Loughborough University. The academic side was taken on by Loughborough College just over the road.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Michael Szabo, the starting quarter-back from Austria, runs with the ball during a training session at Loughborough University.</p></li> </ul>    <ul> <li><p>Edgar Wallen, a running back from Sweden, carries the ball in a drill (above), two offensive linemen go up against each other wearing padding on top of their helmets, and knee braces, for safety.</p></li> </ul>        <ul> <li><p>The students, including offensive lineman from D\u00fcsseldorf Niko Kampas (above left), attend a seminar on finance in the lecture theatre at Loughborough College. Another seminar for the students, this time over at the University, where defensive coordinator Daniel Docal goes through a film showing the attacking formations of their upcoming opponents, De la Salle Spartans.</p></li> </ul>    <p>Then in the spring of 2023 the NFL decided a change of leadership was necessary and brought in two men with huge experience and abundant knowledge of what it takes to succeed at all levels of the sport in America, two men who are now taking the academy on to a different level \u2013 Lamonte Winston (below right) from California was appointed head of the academy and Steve Hagen (below left) from Tennessee head coach. They are like two very different surrogate fathers to their boys, Winston the quiet, smooth-talker, more interested in the pastoral care and the education side while Hagen is the straight talker, who oversees all the playing side. Between them they get the balance just right.</p>    <p>Success for the academy is measured in how many alumni make it on to scholarships at US colleges \u2013 currently there are 19 at the top Division 1 level of colleges. NFL teams still choose almost their entire rosters from the US college system. Occasionally, and they are extremely rare, someone bucks that trend.</p> <p>But, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/rugby-union-premiership-christian-wade-louis-rees-zammit-nfl\">rugby union stars Christian Wade</a> and Louis Rees-Zammit have shown, you may have all the raw talent but if you don\u2019t have the knowledge of American football, it\u2019s very hard to learn it and transition successfully from another sport. It\u2019s tough for them to compete with athletes who have been playing the game since the age of eight. That\u2019s why the academy like to get them earlier. \u201cWe\u2019re playing catch up. Oh, absolutely. I joke that our coaching staff, we\u2019re like the best short order cooks in the world,\u201d Winston says.</p> <p>Hagen continues: \u201cThis is a longer runway for them. It\u2019s a longer path for them to catch up, because they start at an earlier age. If I had Louis at 16, as opposed to 23, I mean, that\u2019s seven years of catch up. That\u2019s not catching up, that\u2019s living it, and he just didn\u2019t have an opportunity to live it. So when we get them at a younger age now, they\u2019re embedded, immersed, and they live this, and it becomes who they are. They become a football player, as opposed to a rugby player who\u2019s trying to catch up. And unfortunately for them it wasn\u2019t around. But fortunately for others that have an interest or would like to take that path, it is around.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>Head coach Steve Hagen speaks to his players after a training session.</p></li> </ul> <p>Until recently, 19-year-old Rafael Varona-Blakstad from Willesden in north-west London was an England academy rugby player with Saracens, a very promising career was all mapped out in front of him. That all changed last year on the day he visited Loughborough University, checking it as a possible place of further education. It was there when he bumped into Lamonte Winston and the wily recruiter asked if he had ever tried out American Football. Next thing he knew had been invited to see the first NFL Academy match at the Spurs Stadium last October. Even though he was blown away by it, there was a nagging doubt, unsure about leaving a sport he had put so much work into.</p> <p>\u201cI was kind of thinking about switching to a completely new sport where nothing is guaranteed \u2013 that\u2019s why I was kind of on the fence.\u201d Then he got a call out of the blue.</p> <p>\u201cCoach Hagen made it happen. He got Louis Rees-Zammit in contact with me, and he basically Facetimed one evening. I was thinking, oh my goodness this is crazy. Louis was saying to me, if the academy had been around when he was coming up through rugby, and even if he knew he\u2019d make it in rugby as a pro player, he would jump at this opportunity instead \u2013 even if that meant he didn\u2019t achieve all things he did. So for me, when my idol says that, there\u2019s no way you can turn it down. If you make it, then, you know, your life\u2019s changed for ever.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>Rafael Varona-Blakstad, a wide receiver from west London, writes into the notebook he uses to memorise certain plays in his Academy accommodation.</p></li> </ul> <p>Varona-Blakstad is now beginning to see the difference in scale of rugby to the NFL. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the wages players are paid, they also have infinitely bigger stages. They regularly pack out 100,000-seater stadiums for not only professional games, but also college games. It\u2019s absolutely incredible. And kind of, if you succeed in this, if you can get to the top of it, that would almost be like the pinnacle of sport.</p> <p>\u201cThis academy is like a factory, a machine to make players and essentially get them to the States where they can play and compete at the highest level. You very quickly realise how big and serious this is. This isn\u2019t for fun.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting in the vast Powerhouse gym of Loughborough University, 18-year-old Irishman Liam Dineen shakes his head in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Like, seven, eight months ago, this was not remotely possible, I hadn\u2019t even thought of it.\u201d</p> <p>Coming from the remote tiny village of Innishannon in Cork, Gaelic football was his sport. \u201cThat\u2019s where I got my kind of kicking talent from, from kicking a football since I was knee high.\u201d It was late last year that he started to have a few session at a Leader Kicking clinic in Ireland run by the former rugby player Tadhg Leader. This is a programme designed to transform talented players from both rugby and Gaelic football into American football kickers. Then this May, Dineen (below) got on attended a trial in Dublin for the NFL Academy \u2013 to his amazement he got an offer.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all happened so quick. But the opportunity is huge, all the facilities here, the culture, I\u2019m learning very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Like his colleague Varona-Blakstad, Dineen acknowledges the education in the sport they need. \u201cWe\u2019ve a lot of catch up to do, because these kids been playing in America since they\u2019re four or five years old.\u201d But they are also both examples of the pulling power that American Football has now over here, where two talented young athletes are ditching the traditional sports they have grown up with and been so successful at in order to chase the dream of playing in the NFL.</p> <p>The website for the Academy proudly boasts the \u201clife-changing opportunities\u201d it provides. For Benson Jerry from Nigeria, that couldn\u2019t be more true.</p> <p>\u201cThe hood I grew up in, it\u2019s nothing to write home about. It\u2019s like proper trenches, like, no water, nothing, nothing.\u201d Benson was brought up in Nyanya, a very poor suburb of Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital. Ten years ago the Boko Haram terrorist group bombed the bus station there killing 88 people. He had to beg money off friends in order to go to work out a gym. \u201cIt\u2019s a different hunger for me. Because where I came out from, it\u2019s an unruly area, and you have to work hard to make it, it\u2019s a grind.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>Benson Jerry, a defensive lineman from Nigeria, lifts weights and a medicine ball in the gym, alongside Liam Dineen (above left) and Rafael Varona-Blakstad (above right) and warms up ahead of the game against De La Salle Spartans.</p></li> </ul>      <p>He was first spotted at a NFL trial in Nigeria and then invited to another NFL trial in Kenya. That was Benson\u2019s first time on a plane. He impressed so much that an offer from the academy came straight away.</p> <p>Looking out over the plush campus of Loughborough University he says he has to keep pinching himself that this is true. \u201cTwo years ago, if you said I\u2019ll be sitting here, I\u2019d say you\u2019re lying. It\u2019s a dream, I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s a big dream for me. My entire life has changed ever since I came to the UK.\u201d Instead of now worrying about where the next meal is coming from, Benson\u2019s attention is fixed on learning the academy playbook, getting himself noticed in the matches and obtaining the offer from a college in the States.</p>    <ul> <li><p>The NFL Academy players take part in a training session at Loughborough University.</p></li> </ul> <p>At the academy there are currently 69 players between the ages of 16 to 19, from 19 different countries; 27 hail from the UK and Ireland. \u201cThese international players, wherever they\u2019re from, Hong Kong, Australia, Japan, all over Europe. We\u2019ve got 19 different countries represented on this team, to give them an opportunity to go to America and play football. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to do that? Soccer\u2019s done the best over here, American football\u2019s done the best over in America,\u201d coach Hagen says. \u201cAnd so this academy is designed just as if you were in school in America. You go to school and you practice, you lift weights, you go to school and you practice, and you study football.\u201d \u201cAnd who will we play? We\u2019ll play American teams, which was a high priority for me, because the way our boys are student athletes get recruited to even have a chance in America is to compete against American football teams. Otherwise the comparison isn\u2019t even close. And now you see us this year, we\u2019re just playing American football teams and that\u2019s just going to continue to grow the academy.\u201d</p> <p>A major part of the recruitment process for the Academy is their ability to play a match at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium when it\u2019s in full NFL mode.

      "bodyText": "We know what\u2019s coming, we\u2019ve seen it before. Every October since 2007, bar a Covid hiatus, the London sporting scene gets infiltrated by an invasion from across the pond. The sporting superpower that is the National Football League comes to town and thousands of fans in garish, oversized jerseys can be seen wondering the streets. This year is no different: three games spread over three weekends, each one, whether it\u2019s at Wembley or Tottenham, packed to the rafters. But there is now another NFL London game, a fourth one, a match attended by maybe 2,000 people, but one that is a vital for the future global growth of American football. In fact you could argue it is far more important to the NFL than how many times Aaron Rodgers gets sacked by the Minnesota defence. But this is a game played by a bunch of teenagers. On Tuesday night, just two days after the Jets and Vikings battled it out there, the Spurs Stadium saw the NFL Academy host one of the top American high schools, one rich in history and pedigree, the De La Salle Spartans. The NFL Academy take on De La Salle Spartans at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The first NFL Academy began life five years ago in the more humble surroundings of Barnet and Southgate College in north London. Set up as a major global initiative by the NFL, it aimed to provide full-time high-school education for 16- to 19-year-olds alongside intensive training in American football under the guidance of a world class coaching staff. At the same time as helping to develop the sport worldwide it was also designed to create a pathway for young international talent Not helped by the pandemic, the academy had a stuttering start and didn\u2019t have its first match until spring 2022, a game against D\u00fcsseldorf Panther in Germany. They were victorious then and have been unbeaten since against European teams, often winning by huge margins. But in summer 2022 the academy took a major step forward and decided to change locations, moving to the East Midlands and the elite athletic performance centre at Loughborough University. The academic side was taken on by Loughborough College just over the road. Michael Szabo, the starting quarter-back from Austria, runs with the ball during a training session at Loughborough University. Edgar Wallen, a running back from Sweden, carries the ball in a drill (above), two offensive linemen go up against each other wearing padding on top of their helmets, and knee braces, for safety. The students, including offensive lineman from D\u00fcsseldorf Niko Kampas (above left), attend a seminar on finance in the lecture theatre at Loughborough College. Another seminar for the students, this time over at the University, where defensive coordinator Daniel Docal goes through a film showing the attacking formations of their upcoming opponents, De la Salle Spartans. Then in the spring of 2023 the NFL decided a change of leadership was necessary and brought in two men with huge experience and abundant knowledge of what it takes to succeed at all levels of the sport in America, two men who are now taking the academy on to a different level \u2013 Lamonte Winston (below right) from California was appointed head of the academy and Steve Hagen (below left) from Tennessee head coach. They are like two very different surrogate fathers to their boys, Winston the quiet, smooth-talker, more interested in the pastoral care and the education side while Hagen is the straight talker, who oversees all the playing side. Between them they get the balance just right. Success for the academy is measured in how many alumni make it on to scholarships at US colleges \u2013 currently there are 19 at the top Division 1 level of colleges. NFL teams still choose almost their entire rosters from the US college system. Occasionally, and they are extremely rare, someone bucks that trend. But, as rugby union stars Christian Wade and Louis Rees-Zammit have shown, you may have all the raw talent but if you don\u2019t have the knowledge of American football, it\u2019s very hard to learn it and transition successfully from another sport. It\u2019s tough for them to compete with athletes who have been playing the game since the age of eight. That\u2019s why the academy like to get them earlier. \u201cWe\u2019re playing catch up. Oh, absolutely. I joke that our coaching staff, we\u2019re like the best short order cooks in the world,\u201d Winston says. Hagen continues: \u201cThis is a longer runway for them. It\u2019s a longer path for them to catch up, because they start at an earlier age. If I had Louis at 16, as opposed to 23, I mean, that\u2019s seven years of catch up. That\u2019s not catching up, that\u2019s living it, and he just didn\u2019t have an opportunity to live it. So when we get them at a younger age now, they\u2019re embedded, immersed, and they live this, and it becomes who they are. They become a football player, as opposed to a rugby player who\u2019s trying to catch up. And unfortunately for them it wasn\u2019t around. But fortunately for others that have an interest or would like to take that path, it is around.\u201d Head coach Steve Hagen speaks to his players after a training session. Until recently, 19-year-old Rafael Varona-Blakstad from Willesden in north-west London was an England academy rugby player with Saracens, a very promising career was all mapped out in front of him. That all changed last year on the day he visited Loughborough University, checking it as a possible place of further education. It was there when he bumped into Lamonte Winston and the wily recruiter asked if he had ever tried out American Football. Next thing he knew had been invited to see the first NFL Academy match at the Spurs Stadium last October. Even though he was blown away by it, there was a nagging doubt, unsure about leaving a sport he had put so much work into. \u201cI was kind of thinking about switching to a completely new sport where nothing is guaranteed \u2013 that\u2019s why I was kind of on the fence.\u201d Then he got a call out of the blue. \u201cCoach Hagen made it happen. He got Louis Rees-Zammit in contact with me, and he basically Facetimed one evening. I was thinking, oh my goodness this is crazy. Louis was saying to me, if the academy had been around when he was coming up through rugby, and even if he knew he\u2019d make it in rugby as a pro player, he would jump at this opportunity instead \u2013 even if that meant he didn\u2019t achieve all things he did. So for me, when my idol says that, there\u2019s no way you can turn it down. If you make it, then, you know, your life\u2019s changed for ever.\u201d Rafael Varona-Blakstad, a wide receiver from west London, writes into the notebook he uses to memorise certain plays in his Academy accommodation. Varona-Blakstad is now beginning to see the difference in scale of rugby to the NFL. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the wages players are paid, they also have infinitely bigger stages. They regularly pack out 100,000-seater stadiums for not only professional games, but also college games. It\u2019s absolutely incredible. And kind of, if you succeed in this, if you can get to the top of it, that would almost be like the pinnacle of sport. \u201cThis academy is like a factory, a machine to make players and essentially get them to the States where they can play and compete at the highest level. You very quickly realise how big and serious this is. This isn\u2019t for fun.\u201d Sitting in the vast Powerhouse gym of Loughborough University, 18-year-old Irishman Liam Dineen shakes his head in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Like, seven, eight months ago, this was not remotely possible, I hadn\u2019t even thought of it.\u201d Coming from the remote tiny village of Innishannon in Cork, Gaelic football was his sport. \u201cThat\u2019s where I got my kind of kicking talent from, from kicking a football since I was knee high.\u201d It was late last year that he started to have a few session at a Leader Kicking clinic in Ireland run by the former rugby player Tadhg Leader. This is a programme designed to transform talented players from both rugby and Gaelic football into American football kickers. Then this May, Dineen (below) got on attended a trial in Dublin for the NFL Academy \u2013 to his amazement he got an offer. \u201cIt\u2019s all happened so quick. But the opportunity is huge, all the facilities here, the culture, I\u2019m learning very quickly.\u201d Like his colleague Varona-Blakstad, Dineen acknowledges the education in the sport they need. \u201cWe\u2019ve a lot of catch up to do, because these kids been playing in America since they\u2019re four or five years old.\u201d But they are also both examples of the pulling power that American Football has now over here, where two talented young athletes are ditching the traditional sports they have grown up with and been so successful at in order to chase the dream of playing in the NFL. The website for the Academy proudly boasts the \u201clife-changing opportunities\u201d it provides. For Benson Jerry from Nigeria, that couldn\u2019t be more true. \u201cThe hood I grew up in, it\u2019s nothing to write home about. It\u2019s like proper trenches, like, no water, nothing, nothing.\u201d Benson was brought up in Nyanya, a very poor suburb of Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital. Ten years ago the Boko Haram terrorist group bombed the bus station there killing 88 people. He had to beg money off friends in order to go to work out a gym. \u201cIt\u2019s a different hunger for me. Because where I came out from, it\u2019s an unruly area, and you have to work hard to make it, it\u2019s a grind.\u201d Benson Jerry, a defensive lineman from Nigeria, lifts weights and a medicine ball in the gym, alongside Liam Dineen (above left) and Rafael Varona-Blakstad (above right) and warms up ahead of the game against De La Salle Spartans. He was first spotted at a NFL trial in Nigeria and then invited to another NFL trial in Kenya. That was Benson\u2019s first time on a plane. He impressed so much that an offer from the academy came straight away. Looking out over the plush campus of Loughborough University he says he has to keep pinching himself that this is true. \u201cTwo years ago, if you said I\u2019ll be sitting here, I\u2019d say you\u2019re lying. It\u2019s a dream, I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s a big dream for me. My entire life has changed ever since I came to the UK.\u201d Instead of now worrying about where the next meal is coming from, Benson\u2019s attention is fixed on learning the academy playbook, getting himself noticed in the matches and obtaining the offer from a college in the States. The NFL Academy players take part in a training session at Loughborough University. At the academy there are currently 69 players between the ages of 16 to 19, from 19 different countries; 27 hail from the UK and Ireland. \u201cThese international players, wherever they\u2019re from, Hong Kong, Australia, Japan, all over Europe. We\u2019ve got 19 different countries represented on this team, to give them an opportunity to go to America and play football. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to do that? Soccer\u2019s done the best over here, American football\u2019s done the best over in America,\u201d coach Hagen says. \u201cAnd so this academy is designed just as if you were in school in America. You go to school and you practice, you lift weights, you go to school and you practice, and you study football.\u201d \u201cAnd who will we play? We\u2019ll play American teams, which was a high priority for me, because the way our boys are student athletes get recruited to even have a chance in America is to compete against American football teams. Otherwise the comparison isn\u2019t even close. And now you see us this year, we\u2019re just playing American football teams and that\u2019s just going to continue to grow the academy.\u201d A major part of the recruitment process for the Academy is their ability to play a match at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium when it\u2019s in full NFL mode. When they are competing with other sports to attract the most talented athletes, it certainly is a major draw for kids across the world to know they have a chance to play on a stage like that. Even though both coaches and players repeat the mantra that every game is big (which is true given that they play such few games, just the four this season), they know the highest profile match is the one at Spurs. The whole match is livestreamed on the NFL YouTube channel, filmed by the same cameras used in the pro games there, beamed back to the watching college recruiters in America.

NFL Academy players Arthur De Boachie (left) from Holland and Kevin Bentin from Germany (right) are congratulated by teammates at a commitment ceremony where they announce which US college has given them a scholarship. Cam Winston, the defensive backs coach for the NFL Academy, gathers all the players together in the showers of the home dressing room for a prayer just before kick off. The NFL Academy offensive linemen including Max Hoke from Sweden, practice routines (above left) during the warm up, while offensive lineman Terho Vainio from Helsinki, practices his snaps. NFL Academy players practice sprints (above left), Thayrancel Pinas (left), a wide reciever from Holland, and Enrique Aspinall, a running back from south London, wrestle with each other watched by teammates and coaches (above right), the NFL Academy players line up to shield their warm up from the opposition (below). Seb Harris, an 18-year-old from Streatham in London, bites his tongue slightly and recalls what it was like to play there \u201cI hate to say it, as an Arsenal fan, it\u2019s one of the best stadiums in England.\u201d He goes on: \u201cMost people never get that chance. Every game we play is an audition for us, a chance to get on film and show people in America what we can actually do here and that we\u2019re not so different from them.\u201d Harris, a tall athletic wide receiver, strongly tipped to go far in the game, is in his final year at the academy.

NFL Academy player Seb Harris from London catches the ball for a touchdown but it was cancelled out due to a penalty. NFL Academy player Rafael Varona-Blakstad from London chips a kick off (above left), Isaac Fullah from Oxford drops the ball as he gets clattered by Matthew Johnson of De La Salle, NFL Academy player Raul Khalifa from Finland desperately tries to stop Kai Wilson of De La Salle by grabbing his shirt tail (below).

      "body": "<p>Like the best stories, the biggest adventures and football itself, this begins in a pub. In 2005 the journalist Javier C\u00e1ceres flew from Berlin to Santiago to interview Leonel S\u00e1nchez in a bar called Munich where the former international had his own stein with his name on. S\u00e1nchez, the son of a boxer, joint-top scorer at the 1962 World Cup, was one of Chile\u2019s greatest players and among the hardest too. Once leader of the team they named the Blue Ballet, what he did that day over a beer would, two decades on and purely by chance, bring together footballers from around the world in a unique collection of art.</p> <p>In the Battle of Santiago, between Chile and Italy \u2013 memorably introduced by David Coleman as \u201cthe most stupid, appalling, disgusting and disgraceful exhibition of football, possibly in the history of the game\u201d \u2013 it was S\u00e1nchez who broke Humberto Maschio\u2019s nose and hit Mario David. But he then scored in Chile\u2019s quarter-final against the Soviet Union, the radio commentator Julio Mart\u00ednez embedding it in the collective conscience with shouts of \u201cDivine justice!\u201d Of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s 260 goals, beating Lev Yashin meant the most. Yet as he described that moment, C\u00e1ceres couldn\u2019t picture it. So he handed S\u00e1nchez a pen and asked him to draw it.</p> <p>\u201cI have a notebook, the typical Moleskine, and when I got home I looked at his drawing and thought: \u2018Wow, how nice,\u2019\u201d C\u00e1ceres says. \u201cI remember gazing at that picture as if it opened another door, another way of engaging. It was an idea that appeared by luck in a bar, but I thought that every time I met a player from then on I would ask about the nicest, most historic, most defining goal of their career, the story behind it \u2013 and ask them to draw it.</p>    <p>\u201cA few days later I met Chamaco Vald\u00e9s. He was younger than S\u00e1nchez but also scored against the USSR, in 1973. The Soviet Union refused to go, saying they wouldn\u2019t play in a concentration camp \u2013 Chile\u2019s national stadium had been used to hold, torture and execute prisoners after the coup \u2013 but the \u201cgame\u201d went ahead. There\u2019s a referee and no opponents. Chile kick off, four players pass among themselves and Chamaco, the captain, scores.</p> <p>\u201cAn Italian book, <em>Lo Stadio dei </em><em>Sogni</em>, narrates the goal, including the tale of Chamaco later apologising to Pablo Neruda [the Chilean poet, diplomat and politician]. I asked him about it, thinking that version was more or less true, but it was totally made up and he was indignant. For him, the goal was real, and it mattered: this was the second leg of the playoff that took Chile to the 1974 World Cup. He draws four crosses, the posts, an arrow, no keeper. Those are the stories that emerge with the pictures.\u201d</p> <p>Without knowing it yet, a collection had begun, a personal journey that followed C\u00e1ceres\u2019s profession, notebooks filling with drawings, a kind of memory bank built. C\u00e1ceres had two goals then: across the next 20 years he collected more than 150, 118 of which have now been published in Germany in a book called <em>Tore wie </em><em>Gemalt.</em> (Roughly: Goals as if Painted.)</p> <p>\u201cSome felt embarrassed. I remember Bobby Charlton saying: \u2018No one ever asked me for anything like this before.\u2019 And many protested: \u2018But I can\u2019t draw.\u2019 That didn\u2019t matter, and most agreed. Others were fascinated by what fellow players had done; I was struck by Mario G\u00f6tze\u2019s enthusiasm perusing the notebook, how he wanted to know which goals had been chosen. I didn\u2019t know he was such a football fan.</p>    <p>\u201cThe collection becomes a book the day Diego Maradona dies. His goal against England in 1986 is the most important in the 20th century. I tried to get to him many times; at the Brazil World Cup I was close. I get called to replace a colleague on a TV show he\u2019s on, too. He arrives late, stops to takes pictures with the staff, and misses it. The cleaning lady at the IBC came before his professional commitment, which says something about him. But I missed him. I had lots of goals: Beckenbauer, M\u00fcller, Charlton, Pel\u00e9, but not Maradona. When he died, I thought: it can\u2019t get better now; this should be shared.</p> <p>\u201cI saw Pel\u00e9 in 2006. He was in Berlin and had to get to Cologne that night. I was fortunate to get a brief slot with him but unfortunate to get the last, the day\u2019s delays accumulating and making everyone nervous. The priority was the interview \u2013 I remember him saying it was true that Ronaldinho was bigger than Pel\u00e9 \u2026 4cm bigger \u2013 and when we get to the end, I say: \u2018I collect goals. Can I ask you which means most to you?\u2019 He says the most important was against Wales in 1958, the most beautiful against Sweden in the final, and the most difficult his thousandth; it\u2019s only a penalty but everyone had been waiting weeks for it.</p> <p>\u201cThen he says: \u2018Nah. Look \u2026\u2019 He asks the assistant, who is getting nervous because he has to get Pel\u00e9 to the airport, for a marker and starts to draw. He\u2019s in front of me so I can\u2019t see what he\u2019s doing properly. I listened back to the tape recently and he takes over two minutes, an eternity in that context, and I\u2019m sweating, thinking: they\u2019ll pull the pen from his hand and say: \u2018We have to go.\u2019 He draws the grass, the posts, the net, the ball, and then writes: 1282. He hands back the notebook and says: \u2018All my goals were important.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Pel\u00e9, defined. His goal (goals) sits between Fernando Morientes and Marc Degryse, an expression of equality, the collection offered without order or hierarchy, each goal accompanied by the player\u2019s explanation and recollection, sometimes imperfect. The result is nostalgia overload, continuous discovery, but it is more: there is something intimate in each image; in the goal \u2013 the life \u2013 they choose and the way they portray it.</p> <p>\u201cA goal makes us children again,\u201d Jorge Valdano, the former Argentina international and Real Madrid general manager, writes in the prologue; C\u00e1ceres suggests: \u201cMaybe drawing it does, too. What is a nice goal? The one you dream and the one you remember.\u201d</p> <p>NThe collection was nominated for the German football culture award, and the newspaper <em>Die</em> <em>Zeit</em> described it as a rebellion against endless analysis, where the innocence of a children\u2019s game is overshadowed by so much noise from others. This puts the players back at the centre of it and hands them a pen. And yet even in its simplicity, every picture can pull you in deep, drawn to the detail, the meaning, the little curiosities and all they convey.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about a personality revealed in each picture, but some perhaps serve as a kind of \u2018psychograph\u2019,\u201d C\u00e1ceres says. \u201cIn Dunga\u2019s case, say, maybe what you see is a fear. He draws the penalty from the 1994 World Cup. He does the goal very, very small and the signature alongside is huge. He says: \u2018Do you know why it\u2019s so small? Because that\u2019s how it was in that moment.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Pep Guardiola\u2019s goal looks like, well, a Pep Guardiola tactics board, although it is not just him: there are arrows and crosses and stick men everywhere. \u201cThat\u2019s the default perspective, diagrams rather than drawings; maybe as professionals they are so used to seeing the game like that: almost all of them draw their goal from above,\u201d C\u00e1ceres says.</p> <p>Oscar Ruggeri alone breaks that trend. Gerd M\u00fcller\u2019s drawing looks like a piece of abstract art. Lothar Matth\u00e4us\u2019s is neat, organised. Steve Nicol\u2019s could have been done by Quentin Blake. Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano\u2019s picture is indecipherable and, frankly, a bit phallic.</p>    <p>George Weah\u2019s depiction of his famous run from one end to the other against Verona is glorious in its fullness, 14 little men on a page: \u201cHe drew all the opponents first, the entire pitch, and then the line as he dribbles through them all.\u201d In Xabi Alonso\u2019s picture, of his penalty and follow up in Istanbul at the 2005 Champions League final, Dida\u2019s arms are <em>long</em>; it\u2019s not a bad drawing, it is how Alonso saw the Milan goalkeeper. \u201cIf you look at Roberto Carlos\u2019s, there\u2019s a small rectangle by the goal. He explains that the secret of <em>that</em> free-kick was that he used the yellow advertising board for the French post office as a reference point. That\u2019s what the rectangle is.\u201d</p> <p>Some choices are obvious, some less so. \u201cLillian Thuram scores two in the semi-final of France 98, the only goals he has ever scored [for France]. His [auto]biography is called <em>8 July 1998</em>, the date of that game. But he chooses a game he plays as a kid that convinces a team unsure about signing him \u2013 because, he suspects, he\u2019s black \u2013 to finally do so. Without that goal, there are no others. [Gary] Lineker chooses one against Poland in 86; a \u2018normal\u2019 goal that changes his life. Paul Breitner scores in the 1974 World Cup final but doesn\u2019t choose that.\u201d</p> <p>As for Michel Platini, he hasn\u2019t drawn his best goal at all; no art, just an autograph. \u201cHe signed his name and handed the notebook back. I said: \u2018No, I need you to draw it.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 \u2018Because they took it off me.\u2019 I watched it since: the goal, scored in the final of the Intercontinental Cup, is truly amazing and there\u2019s no reason to rule it out.\u201d Joy denied and not drawn. And that, in essence, is the point.</p> <p>\u201cThis book has reconciled me with the world in a way,\u201d C\u00e1ceres says. \u201cA goal is a feeling of happiness that\u2019s absolutely pure, nothing else.When I took my daughter in my arms for the first time I was happy but it comes with responsibility, places you before an abyss. A goal is a happiness with no asterisk. I never had the feeling that players chose and drew their goals for reasons of vanity, but joy. It\u2019s not easy to define or depict a moment of pure happiness, which all these moments were, and that\u2019s something special.\u201d</p>",

For him, the goal was real, and it mattered: this was the second leg of the playoff that took Chile to the 1974 World Cup. He draws four crosses, the posts, an arrow, no keeper. Those are the stories that emerge with the pictures.\u201d Without knowing it yet, a collection had begun, a personal journey that followed C\u00e1ceres\u2019s profession, notebooks filling with drawings, a kind of memory bank built. C\u00e1ceres had two goals then: across the next 20 years he collected more than 150, 118 of which have now been published in Germany in a book called Tore wie Gemalt. (Roughly: Goals as if Painted.) \u201cSome felt embarrassed. I remember Bobby Charlton saying: \u2018No one ever asked me for anything like this before.\u2019 And many protested: \u2018But I can\u2019t draw.\u2019 That didn\u2019t matter, and most agreed. Others were fascinated by what fellow players had done; I was struck by Mario G\u00f6tze\u2019s enthusiasm perusing the notebook, how he wanted to know which goals had been chosen. I didn\u2019t know he was such a football fan. \u201cThe collection becomes a book the day Diego Maradona dies. His goal against England in 1986 is the most important in the 20th century. I tried to get to him many times; at the Brazil World Cup I was close. I get called to replace a colleague on a TV show he\u2019s on, too. He arrives late, stops to takes pictures with the staff, and misses it. The cleaning lady at the IBC came before his professional commitment, which says something about him. But I missed him. I had lots of goals: Beckenbauer, M\u00fcller, Charlton, Pel\u00e9, but not Maradona. When he died, I thought: it can\u2019t get better now; this should be shared. \u201cI saw Pel\u00e9 in 2006. He was in Berlin and had to get to Cologne that night. I was fortunate to get a brief slot with him but unfortunate to get the last, the day\u2019s delays accumulating and making everyone nervous. The priority was the interview \u2013 I remember him saying it was true that Ronaldinho was bigger than Pel\u00e9 \u2026 4cm bigger \u2013 and when we get to the end, I say: \u2018I collect goals. Can I ask you which means most to you?\u2019 He says the most important was against Wales in 1958, the most beautiful against Sweden in the final, and the most difficult his thousandth; it\u2019s only a penalty but everyone had been waiting weeks for it. \u201cThen he says: \u2018Nah. Look \u2026\u2019 He asks the assistant, who is getting nervous because he has to get Pel\u00e9 to the airport, for a marker and starts to draw. He\u2019s in front of me so I can\u2019t see what he\u2019s doing properly. I listened back to the tape recently and he takes over two minutes, an eternity in that context, and I\u2019m sweating, thinking: they\u2019ll pull the pen from his hand and say: \u2018We have to go.\u2019 He draws the grass, the posts, the net, the ball, and then writes: 1282. He hands back the notebook and says: \u2018All my goals were important.\u2019\u201d Pel\u00e9, defined. His goal (goals) sits between Fernando Morientes and Marc Degryse, an expression of equality, the collection offered without order or hierarchy, each goal accompanied by the player\u2019s explanation and recollection, sometimes imperfect. The result is nostalgia overload, continuous discovery, but it is more: there is something intimate in each image; in the goal \u2013 the life \u2013 they choose and the way they portray it. \u201cA goal makes us children again,\u201d Jorge Valdano, the former Argentina international and Real Madrid general manager, writes in the prologue; C\u00e1ceres suggests: \u201cMaybe drawing it does, too. What is a nice goal? The one you dream and the one you remember.\u201d NThe collection was nominated for the German football culture award, and the newspaper Die Zeit described it as a rebellion against endless analysis, where the innocence of a children\u2019s game is overshadowed by so much noise from others. This puts the players back at the centre of it and hands them a pen. And yet even in its simplicity, every picture can pull you in deep, drawn to the detail, the meaning, the little curiosities and all they convey. \u201cI don\u2019t know about a personality revealed in each picture, but some perhaps serve as a kind of \u2018psychograph\u2019,\u201d C\u00e1ceres says. \u201cIn Dunga\u2019s case, say, maybe what you see is a fear. He draws the penalty from the 1994 World Cup. He does the goal very, very small and the signature alongside is huge. He says: \u2018Do you know why it\u2019s so small? Because that\u2019s how it was in that moment.\u2019\u201d Pep Guardiola\u2019s goal looks like, well, a Pep Guardiola tactics board, although it is not just him: there are arrows and crosses and stick men everywhere. \u201cThat\u2019s the default perspective, diagrams rather than drawings; maybe as professionals they are so used to seeing the game like that: almost all of them draw their goal from above,\u201d C\u00e1ceres says. Oscar Ruggeri alone breaks that trend. Gerd M\u00fcller\u2019s drawing looks like a piece of abstract art. Lothar Matth\u00e4us\u2019s is neat, organised. Steve Nicol\u2019s could have been done by Quentin Blake. Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano\u2019s picture is indecipherable and, frankly, a bit phallic. George Weah\u2019s depiction of his famous run from one end to the other against Verona is glorious in its fullness, 14 little men on a page: \u201cHe drew all the opponents first, the entire pitch, and then the line as he dribbles through them all.\u201d In Xabi Alonso\u2019s picture, of his penalty and follow up in Istanbul at the 2005 Champions League final, Dida\u2019s arms are long; it\u2019s not a bad drawing, it is how Alonso saw the Milan goalkeeper. \u201cIf you look at Roberto Carlos\u2019s, there\u2019s a small rectangle by the goal. He explains that the secret of that free-kick was that he used the yellow advertising board for the French post office as a reference point. That\u2019s what the rectangle is.\u201d Some choices are obvious, some less so. \u201cLillian Thuram scores two in the semi-final of France 98, the only goals he has ever scored [for France]. His [auto]biography is called 8 July 1998, the date of that game. But he chooses a game he plays as a kid that convinces a team unsure about signing him \u2013 because, he suspects, he\u2019s black \u2013 to finally do so. Without that goal, there are no others. [Gary] Lineker chooses one against Poland in 86; a \u2018normal\u2019 goal that changes his life. Paul Breitner scores in the 1974 World Cup final but doesn\u2019t choose that.\u201d As for Michel Platini, he hasn\u2019t drawn his best goal at all; no art, just an autograph. \u201cHe signed his name and handed the notebook back. I said: \u2018No, I need you to draw it.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 \u2018Because they took it off me.\u2019 I watched it since: the goal, scored in the final of the Intercontinental Cup, is truly amazing and there\u2019s no reason to rule it out.\u201d Joy denied and not drawn. And that, in essence, is the point. \u201cThis book has reconciled me with the world in a way,\u201d C\u00e1ceres says. \u201cA goal is a feeling of happiness that\u2019s absolutely pure, nothing else.When I took my daughter in my arms for the first time I was happy but it comes with responsibility, places you before an abyss. A goal is a happiness with no asterisk. I never had the feeling that players chose and drew their goals for reasons of vanity, but joy. It\u2019s not easy to define or depict a moment of pure happiness, which all these moments were, and that\u2019s something special.\u201d",

The fall was catastrophic, in sporting terms, because it prevented her from riding at the Paris Games.</p> <p>Her recovery in time for the world championships is remarkable but, as we sit high up in the empty stands, Archibald deals with a deep \u00adresidual grief that has nothing to do with sport. In August 2022, her \u00adpartner, Rab Wardell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/24/mountain-bike-rider-rab-wardell-dies-aged-37\">suffered a \u00adcardiac arrest and died </a>at the age of 37. Two days earlier the mountain biker had won the Scottish championship and Archibald\u2019s profound shock was \u00adobvious when she posted a <a href=\"https://x.com/_katiearchibald/status/1562312232381419520\">message on social media</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRab died yesterday \u00admorning. I still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s \u00adhappened; if this is real; why he\u2019d be taken now \u2013 so healthy and happy. He went into \u00adcardiac arrest while we were lying in bed. I tried and tried, and the \u00adparamedics arrived within minutes, but his heart stopped and they couldn\u2019t bring him back. Mine stopped with it.\u201d</p>    <p>If a freak accident robs an \u00adathlete of the chance to compete in the Olympics after four years of hard work, the human tendency is to lament a cruel twist of fate and feel real sadness. For Archibald there was no such reaction: \u201cNot at all,\u201d she says. \u201cIf anything, it was very different as the amount of people that said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m gutted for you,\u2019 made me realise that it really didn\u2019t touch the sides. You know, when I think of \u2026\u201d</p> <p>There is a long pause as Archibald\u2019s mouth crumples. She shakes her head gently, as if trying to stem the tears rising inside her. \u201cJust a sec,\u201d she \u00admurmurs. \u201cI\u2019ll catch my breath.\u201d</p> <p>I know she is thinking about \u00adlosing Rab, the love of her life, and how it cannot be compared to the fleeting disappointment of sport. \u201cBefore Rab [died],\u201d Archibald continues, \u201cI\u2019d been having these issues with anxiety. I\u2019d had this problem with panicking on the bike after I\u2019d had a crash.\u201d</p> <p>In June 2022, six weeks before the start of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Archibald \u201cflew over the bonnet of a 4x4\u201d. She broke both ankles and hurt her leg. \u201cI really struggled after that as it had been an accumulation of stressful things.\u201d</p> <p>Archibald felt a weight of dread inside her whenever she tried to ride her bike again. Then, two months later, Rab died. \u201cI went out on the bike maybe three days post [his death],\u201d Archibald says, \u201cand I noticed that the vice wasn\u2019t around my chest. I couldn\u2019t imagine feeling panicked any more because I was just devastated.\u201d</p> <p>She says those last four words with such sorrow as she tries to find a path through her tears: \u201cIt was a bit \u00adsimilar to this. It was knowing that there is nothing that hurts as much as that.\u201d Archibald can no longer talk and so we both look away while the bikes fly past in a rush. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she \u00adeventually says, without any need for an apology. But Archibald is \u00adcourageous. \u201cI think I just didn\u2019t have enough coffee this morning,\u201d she jokes as she wipes her eyes.</p>    <p>We began our interview with Archibald recalling how she fell for cycling as a pink-haired teenage girl with piercings in her tongue and lip as she raced against middle-aged men on grass&nbsp;tracks in the Highland Games. After her A-levels she worked for a while in telesales at her father\u2019s bedding company and, shyly but with some amusement, she sings a snatch of the&nbsp;jingle that advertised the Archers Sleepcentre on local radio just \u00adoutside Glasgow.</p> <p>She arrived in Manchester as a wide-eyed 19-year-old who had been selected for the GB Academy. \u201cThere was no sense of threat. It was all \u00adopportunity,\u201d she says. \u201cThis chance to do something for what I thought would be for a short period of trying to make it to the Glasgow Commonwealth Games [in 2014]. I felt huge excitement.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re 19 and somebody says: \u2018We\u2019ll let you train full time and target the Commonwealths and maybe even an Olympics,\u2019 there\u2019s never going to be another thought which says: \u2018Ah, well, what are my other options?\u2019 It was the most unbelievable opportunity and thank goodness I went for it.\u201d</p> <p>Later that same year, in 2013, she helped Laura Trott [now Kenny], Dani King [now Rowe] and Elinor Barker break the world record twice as they won the team pursuit at the European championships. Alongside her great friend Kenny, Archibald developed into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/12/katie-archibald-manchester-world-cup-ed-clancy-elinor-barker\">a powerhouse of a rider</a> at multiple world championships and Olympic Games.</p> <p>Her hopes of winning gold in the team pursuit, Madison and omnium in Paris this summer were as \u00adrealistic as they were serious. When she fell in her garden Archibald cried out loud. \u201cIt\u2019s funny but, lying on the ground, the words: \u2018Oh, I think it\u2019s bad\u2019 came&nbsp;out of my mouth like someone else was saying them,\u201d she says. \u201cI opened my eyes and my foot wasn\u2019t where it felt like it should be. I&nbsp;stopped looking because it made me&nbsp;feel more sick.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I got to A&amp;E our team physio was there. They\u2019re trying to keep you calm but by the time [her dislocated ankle] was back in she said she\u2019d stopped sweating. If you don\u2019t get there fast enough, and say there\u2019s a five-hour wait, the blood flow cuts&nbsp;off and there\u2019s a chance you\u2019d lose your foot. They wouldn\u2019t have let that \u00adhappen, obviously, but there were a few little crossroads where I could have been in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Archibald slips off her shoes and says: \u201cIt\u2019s three months on and I\u2019m still limping a bit. I\u2019m not very comfortable walking. But I\u2019m very comfortable I can do a standing start [on her bike] and I\u2019m ready to race. There\u2019s pain but it\u2019s all managed. And it won\u2019t be for ever.\u201d</p> <p>How many times has she been out on the track since her injury? \u201cWe\u2019ve had five team pursuit sessions and five bunched Madison sessions. We had our team pursuit dress rehearsals yesterday. It went really well. I left with a massive smile on my face.\u201d</p> <p>Before losing Rab, Archibald says, \u201cI really had everything in place. I felt so secure in how I could make this team better. I felt secure in knowing how to love, like I had my sense of self and what I cared about in the world. I suppose I still <em>know</em> those things, I just don\u2019t <em>have</em> those things\u201d.</p> <p>We discuss how we both feel, on a sliding scale where 10 signifies an enduring happiness and zero is \u00addesolation. \u201cRight now, my job \u00adsatisfaction is a 10 for sure,\u201d Archibald says before \u00adsmiling. \u201cNot to treat this as a therapy session, but the rest of my life is definitely not a 10.\u201d</p>    <p>It will take time, considering \u00adeverything she has been through, but Archibald sounds strong and \u00adhopeful. She is \u00addetermined to ride all the way to the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 and that \u00adconviction makes her \u00adcurious about new \u00adventures. \u201cWhen it comes specifically to cycling, I\u2019ve had my back against the wall the last two years and I\u2019ve been quite stubborn and domineering of my programme and how I want things run,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like it had to be perfect. Now, I know that the only way I can reach something special in LA is if I try new things. I\u2019ve got three years to explore.</p> <p>\u201cI want to work with a new coach and hand over so much more of my riding career to other people so that I can learn from them. I\u2019ve spent the last two years micromanaging and now I just want to be managed, with my eyes and ears open. When it comes to year four [of the Olympic cycle] I can go back to being overbearing.\u201d</p> <p>Archibald laughs. \u201cI\u2019m going to chill out a bit on the bike and start \u00adchallenging myself more off it. I\u2019m doing something called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/22/access-to-higher-education-diplomas-university-stories-second-chance-students\">an Access course</a>, run by Glasgow University, to help you apply to uni. I\u2019m interested in a nursing degree and want to find out more.\u201d</p> <p>She reveals how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/11/emma-finucane-earns-historic-third-medal-but-britain-frustrated-with-cycling-haul\">Emma Finucane</a> helped her embrace a less \u00adpressurised perspective. The 21-year-old sprint sensation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/11/emma-finucane-earns-historic-third-medal-but-britain-frustrated-with-cycling-haul\">won three medals in Paris</a>, one of them gold, and Archibald says: \u201cEmma\u2019s been a big influence on me. When we were prepping for the Olympics we both had this three-event target. She\u2019s very young and very wise. She convinced me of how good it feels to focus on the \u00adopportunity and not the threat. Maybe it\u2019s easier for her because she\u2019s just starting out but to see somebody still connected to that feeling reminded me that: \u2018Yeah,&nbsp;that\u2019s what it was like when I was 19.\u2019 There\u2019s something to gain here, not something to lose.\u201d</p> <p>Does she still feel this way before the worlds? \u201cOh, way more so, because there is no pressure on me to win. It\u2019s funny that my first \u00adselection to a&nbsp;world championships was in 2014&nbsp;and this selection in 2024 has \u00adprobably been as big a struggle and with as much \u00aduncertainty. It\u2019s just that now I can appreciate and celebrate it&nbsp;appropriately.\u201d</p> <p>We talk more about Rab and the films he made and the sense of fun he instilled into her life. \u201cIt\u2019s funny when thinking about relationships,\u201d she says. \u201cRab and I once had an argument about hoovering. You look at somebody and say: \u2018I love you so much. I love how you make me feel as soon as you\u2019re here. But when you\u2019re not here I look at all this fucking <em>mess!</em>\u2019 It\u2019s that difference between getting annoyed at somebody because they\u2019ve done something stupid and never, ever getting annoyed about how they make you feel. That was Rab and me.\u201d</p> <p>There is a sudden lightness around Archibald as if she knows, beyond the lingering heartache, she is \u00adextraordinary both on and off the bike. Once the worlds are over, and remaining in Denmark, she will attend the wedding of her old \u00adteammate Elinor Barker, with whom she has won so many races. Archibald smiles again: \u201cI said a few months ago that goal No&nbsp;1 is world championship selection. Goal No&nbsp;2 is the ability to dance at Elinor\u2019s wedding. Well, there\u2019ll be no stopping me on that dancefloor.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Katie Archibald reflects on the differences between sport, life and death with such moving insight that I have to look away. So much raw feeling is etched into her face, as her eyes fill with tears, that it seems intrusive to just sit and see such pain. I touch her arm lightly in attempted reassurance and then try to turn discreetly to the gleaming pine track where the GB men\u2019s team pursuit squad race past at blurring speed. The soft hiss of their bikes makes an eerie sound at the Manchester Velodrome as they prepare for the track world championships, which begin in Ballerup, Denmark on Wednesday. Archibald, a five-time world champion who won gold at the Rio and Tokyo Olympics, will compete in the women\u2019s team pursuit and Madison. Even being on the track will be an incredible achievement. In June, when she was preparing for an Olympic Games where many expected that she could win three gold medals, the 30-year-old tripped over a tile in her garden. Archibald dislocated her ankle, broke her tibia and fibula and tore two ligaments off the bone. The fall was catastrophic, in sporting terms, because it prevented her from riding at the Paris Games. Her recovery in time for the world championships is remarkable but, as we sit high up in the empty stands, Archibald deals with a deep residual grief that has nothing to do with sport. In August 2022, her partner, Rab Wardell, suffered a cardiac arrest and died at the age of 37. Two days earlier the mountain biker had won the Scottish championship and Archibald\u2019s profound shock was obvious when she posted a message on social media. \u201cRab died yesterday morning.

fairer fines proportional to a driver\u2019s income.</p> <p>While it might be an annoyance for high income earners, amid cost-of-living pressures a traffic fine can mean lower income earners are forced to choose between essentials or paying it off, The Australia Institute says.</p> <p>Fines are the same for every driver caught speeding based on their jurisdiction, with NSW sometimes offering a 50% discount for people on government benefits.</p> <p><a href=\"https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P1539-Proportional-Speeding-Fines-WEB-2.pdf\">The think tank report</a>

effectively criminalises poverty.</p> </blockquote> <p>The plan proposes a flat fine based on the speeding range, with drivers accruing more based on their income and whether they have dependents.</p> <p>NSW drivers currently pay $361 in fines if caught speeding between 10km/h to 19km/h but under the proposal, drivers could receive a fine ranging from $75 to $885 based on their income.</p> <p>Accrued unpaid fines can trigger a vicious circle, where having the driver\u2019s car registration or licence cancelled leads to a reduced ability to work and pay fines.</p> <p>The report noted

Kate Mason, also from Melbourne, completed the women\u2019s podium in 2:34:08. Gregson\u2019s husband, Ryan Gregson, finished second in the men\u2019s race behind Jack Rayner, who clocked 2:11:49 after winning the Melbourne half-marathon for the past three years. \u2018Steep\u2019 rent hikes pricing more Australians out of homes, advocates fear Renters in Australian capital cities are on average spending nearly $15,000 more a year to rent a house since the pandemic, analysis has revealed. Research from the advocacy organisation Everybody\u2019s Home showed on average renters in capitals were paying $14,700 more annually to rent a house and $9,600 more to rent a unit compared with 2020. Sydney and Perth have endured the steepest rent rises, with annual increases well above capital city averages for units ($10,452 and $14,508 respectively) and houses ($18,512 and $18,304). Adelaide and Brisbane unit rents are also above average. Everybody\u2019s Home analysed rental data from SQM Research to build its report. Maiy Azize, a spokesperson from Everybody\u2019s Home, said \u201ckeeping a roof over their head\u201d was the biggest cost-of-living expense for most people in Australia. The steep rise in rents is pushing more people into severe housing stress and homelessness. For more on this story, read the full report by Guardian Australia\u2019s Cait Kelly: Auction activity remains stable this weekend There were 2,525 auctions expected to be held this weekend, well above the 1,955 held last week and a gain on the 2,275 auctions at the same time last year. Based on results collected so far, CoreLogic\u2019s summary found that the preliminary clearance rate was 66.9% across the country, which is slightly higher than the 63.9% preliminary rate recorded last week but only just above the 65.2% actual rate on final numbers. Across the capital cities: Sydney: 736 of 1004 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 69% Melbourne: 785 of 1044 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 64.8% Brisbane: 152 0f 216 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 62.5% Adelaide: 83 of 164 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 67.5% Canberra: 52 of 83 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 71.2% Tasmania: One auction held Perth: Nine of 13 auctions held Jobs market on display as inflation picture brightens Australia\u2019s labour market is tipped to keep softening little-by-little as persistently high interest rates weigh on demand for workers. Some economists predict another tick higher in the official jobless rate on Thursday when the Australian Bureau of Statistics unveils its monthly labour force report. The Reserve Bank of Australia has jacked up interest rates and kept them high to slow the economy and tame inflation. Yet in a promising sign for borrowers waiting for cuts, August consumer price data showed all-important underlying inflation heading in the right direction, falling to 3.4% in August from 3.8% in July. The RBA maintains it wants to be sure inflation is moving sustainably back within the target band before reducing rates. Further nuggets of insight into the central bank\u2019s thinking may be revealed in a speech by assistant governor Sarah Hunter, who is due to speak on Wednesday at the Citi Australia and New Zealand Investment Conference in Sydney. - AAP Traffic fines should be income-based to avoid \u2018criminalising poverty\u2019, finds new Australia Institute report Australia\u2019s traffic fine systems are \u201ccriminalising poverty\u201d finds a new report calling for fairer fines proportional to a driver\u2019s income. While it might be an annoyance for high income earners, amid cost-of-living pressures a traffic fine can mean lower income earners are forced to choose between essentials or paying it off, The Australia Institute says. Fines are the same for every driver caught speeding based on their jurisdiction, with NSW sometimes offering a 50% discount for people on government benefits. The think tank report is calling for a more equitable Finnish traffic fine model to be implemented in Australia. Having a billionaire pay the same $200 speeding fine as a low income earner is unfair, the institute\u2019s research manager and report co-author Alice Grundy said. Australia\u2019s regressive speeding fine system effectively criminalises poverty. The plan proposes a flat fine based on the speeding range, with drivers accruing more based on their income and whether they have dependents. NSW drivers currently pay $361 in fines if caught speeding between 10km/h to 19km/h but under the proposal, drivers could receive a fine ranging from $75 to $885 based on their income. Accrued unpaid fines can trigger a vicious circle, where having the driver\u2019s car registration or licence cancelled leads to a reduced ability to work and pay fines. The report noted that income-based fines were aimed at fairness, rather than changing driver behaviour, suggesting warning signs and physical road modifications were more effective. - AAP Smoke and toxic fumes erupt on Nullarbor highway due to burning semi-trailer carrying household insecticides A burning semi-trailer carrying household insecticides is causing smoke and toxic fumes to erupt after an incident on a highway along the Nullarbor, roughly 88km east of the Western Australian border. South Australian Country Fire Service volunteers are on site with a bulk-water carrier and one truck. SA and WA police and WA fire services are supporting the effort. An exclusion zone has been set up to protect the public from toxic smoke. The truck is expected to burn for at least 10 to 24 hours, and sections of the Eyre Highway between Eucla and Yalata have been closed to traffic. It is unknown when the roads will reopen. Emergency service workers have asked the public not to enter the area due to the injury risk firefighters as visibility is poor. People in the area are advised to remain indoors and in vehicles, with windows and doors closed and any air conditioning set to recirculation to not draw any fumes or smoke into enclosed spaces. Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett has apologised for calling a woman a \u201cbitch\u201d for speaking during his speech at a Young Liberals function on Saturday night. The Nine papers report that Kennett said he regretted making the comment during the Young Liberal Annual Gala held at the Melbourne Arts Centre. Speaking to the Age, Kennett said the woman was \u201cvery, very distracting\u201d. He said she was apart of a group who continued to talk through his speech, despite being asked to be \u201crespectful\u201d. I was giving my speech, [the woman] was sitting at the table immediately in front of me, and speaking continually, and I could hear her, and it was distracting. Kennett said he had been trying to calling the woman to apologise directly but hadn\u2019t \u201cbeen able to make contact\u201d, saying he suspected they were not taking his calls. I apologise for using the word. Dutton\u2019s focus on \u2018dividing Australians\u2019 isolating Libs from international community on Gaza/Lebanon ceasefire The foreign minister, Penny Wong, says the Coalition is \u201cat odds\u201d with the international community and Australia\u2019s key allies over its opposition to calls for a ceasefire in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Responding to an interview earlier on Sunday by the shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, Wong suggested the concession showed Coalition Peter Dutton was \u201cisolated\u201d on this issue and was more concerned with \u201cdividing Australians\u201d. A few days ago, Mr Dutton said the prime minister should be condemned for calling for a ceasefire. Now the Liberals finally realise they\u2019re at odds with the international community, including the United States, who are all pressing for peace \u2013 but he still can\u2019t bring himself to do so. He\u2019s so focused on dividing Australians over this conflict that he doesn\u2019t realise how isolated his position is. We know Mr Dutton is negative about everything but it\u2019s pretty extreme to be negative about a ceasefire that saves civilian lives and prevents further disastrous escalation of conflict. They are relics of the Gondwana age but five years after Australia\u2019s black summer these trees are dying a \u2018long, slow death\u2019 Thousands of years of accumulated leaf fall makes the ground bounce like a mattress underfoot and, high above, rainforest coachwood trees form a dense canopy that dresses the understory in permanent shade. Some of the unique plants in this rainforest can trace their lineage back 40 or 50m years when the Gondwana supercontinent was breaking apart and Australia was detaching itself from what is now Antarctica. Take only a few steps from the cool shade and you emerge to something altogether different. Still rainforest, but changing fast. Soil and rocks are exposed and, above, the leafless branches of tall and dead trees let the sunlight strike the forest floor. This is a place packed with threatened species, including the nightcap oak \u2013 a true Gondwanan relic that grows nowhere else. On the ground and at the base of the thin-barked trees is charcoal. Five years ago, chunks of this in rainforest not evolved to burn, did burn, during what became known as Australia\u2019s black summer bushfires. \u201cIt can take a lot of these trees a long time to die. It is a long, slow death,\u201d says Dr Robert Kooyman, an evolutionary ecologist who has spent more than 40 years working and studying the rainforests in and around Nightcap national park in northern New South Wales. For more on this story, read the full feature from Guardian Australia\u2019s Graham Readfern: Anti-war protesters rally in Sydney CBD Protesters have gathered in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park as part of anti-war protests, calling for an end to Israel\u2019s attacks on southern Lebanon and a ceasefire in Gaza. Large crowds gathered from 1pm to attend the rally, the latest in a year of consistent protests. A march has been held in Melbourne for the 53rd straight week. A crowd had also begun to grow in Brisbane for an anti-war rally. The Australian Friends of Palestine Association in South Australia has held a Run Ride Walk 4 Palestine event at Glenelg. Rallies were also held in Perth and Hobart on Saturday. NZ Labour leader lays out economic plan on first anniversary of party\u2019s election loss New Zealand Labour\u2019s Chris Hipkins has managed to stay on as leader of his party and is now looking forward to the next election, saying he intends to make Chris Luxon\u2019s Nationals a one-term government. Speaking on the eve of the first anniversary of his party\u2019s election loss, Hipkins, who has just visited the UK where Labour has returned to power, laid out his ideas for New Zealand\u2019s future economy to AAP: If we actually want to grow the economy, government does have a role. Government investment on missions with a clear purpose can actually generate huge spin-off benefits. And we shouldn\u2019t be focused on growth for growth\u2019s sake \u2026 we should be saying our goal is to ensure that everybody has a good well-paying job. The economy has been growing \u2013 for the last 40 years \u2013 but the vast majority of the people who are generating the growth aren\u2019t feeling the benefit. To implement that economic strategy, Labour needs to win in 2026. Its odds are poor \u2013 no Kiwi government has been turfed after a single term in half a century \u2013 and Hipkins concedes Labour was \u201cout-campaigned\u201d. \u2013 with AAP NZ government says coalition \u2018working well\u2019 one year in A year on from the election that brought Chris Luxon\u2019s National\u2019s to power in a right-wing coalition, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister has defied expectations of a dysfunctional government. Luxon\u2019s coalition partner, the ACT leader and transport minister David Seymour, says the experience so far has been \u201cmuch less obstructive and keener to get along than I\u2019d anticipated\u2019\u201d. Chris Bishop, National\u2019s campaign chair and the housing and infrastructure minister, insists the coalition is working well behind closed doors. There\u2019s a real willingness from everybody in the coalition to make it work. Differences are resolved amicably and congenially. Many of the policies embraced by the coalition have drawn a mighty backlash, particularly those supported by ACT and NZ First, the minority parties which secured 8.6% and 6.1% of the vote respectively. Public sector cuts \u2013 particularly in health \u2013 and the abolition of smoke-free strategies, fast-tracked consent for mining projects, gun law reform, and most controversially, Treaty of Waitangi reform, have angered many. The future remains uncertain with New Zealand mired in recession and GDP per capita falling by 4.6% over the past seven quarters \u2013 a larger fall than it experienced during the global financial crisis. The economic downturn is largely due to the Reserve Bank ratcheting up interest rates to contain high post-pandemic inflation \u2013 a challenge which appears contained given the centre bank is now easing rates. The unemployment rate has grown by 1.4% in the last two years and is likely to keep growing. - AAP Victorian police are investigating after two pedestrians were run down in a car park early on Sunday morning. Officers were initially called to reports of an illegal rave in a park on Glenferrie Road where they witnessed two pedestrians being struck by a car at 1.10am, killing one. The second person, who is yet to be identified, was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police arrested the driver at the scene. The investigation remains ongoing.

Manhunt afoot for alleged attacker after man dies from hit to head while walking in Melbourne\u2019s CBD A manhunt is under way after an alleged deadly assault in Melbourne\u2019s central business district. Police say a man from Seddon died in hospital on Saturday after he was allegedly attacked by another man earlier in the week. The 44-year-old had been walking on Elizabeth Street from Flinders Street when police allege he was approached and hit in the end. He sustained significant injuries and was taken to hospital where he later died. Homicide Squad detectives are appealing for public assistance to find a man named Todd Menegaldo after the alleged assault. Detectives have conducted a significant search for Menegaldo in the past few days, police said. Menegaldo, who also goes by the nickname \u201cRooster\u201d, is described as approximately 180 to 185cm tall with a thin build. Police said he had a black and white crossbreed Staffordshire terrier and was known to frequent the Melbourne CBD, in particular the areas around Elizabeth Street and Flinders Street station, as well as Mildura and Bendigo. Menegaldo was last seen wearing a zip-up purple jumper, dark jeans and a yellow beanie. Police said people should not approach Menegaldo and instead contact triple zero immediately. Melbourne Marathon winners cross finishing line The 2024 Melbourne Marathon is under way with thousands taking part in across the CBD. Here are a few images from on the ground: US official accuses Russia and China of blocking Asia leaders\u2019 statement Russia and China blocked a proposed consensus statement for the East Asia Summit drafted by south-east Asian countries, mainly over objections to language on the contested South China Sea. A draft statement, the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations arrived at by consensus, was put to the 18-nation East Asia Summit meeting in Laos on Thursday evening, a US official told Reuters on Saturday. \u201cAsean presented this final draft and said that, essentially, this was a take-it-or-leave-it draft,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity. Australia, the United States, Japan, South Korea and India all said they could support it, the official said. \u201cThe Russians and the Chinese said that they could not and would not proceed with a statement,\u201d the official said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference in Vientiane on Friday the final declaration had not been adopted because of \u201cpersistent attempts by the United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to turn it into a purely political statement\u201d. China\u2019s Washington embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The US official said there were a couple of issues of contention, but the main one was how it referred to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), going further than in the previous 2023 EAS statement. \u201cThere was certainly no language that was getting into the nitty gritty of any particular standoff, no language that was favouring any claimant over any other,\u201d the official said. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea and has stepped up pressure on rival claimants, including several Asean countries, notably the Philippines. \u2013 AAP \u2018If you want us to die, we need to know\u2019: hundreds of thousands of Afghans are waiting for visas to Australia \u2013 and time is running out Some managed to evacuate.

Afghan-Australian Sara* is sobbing as she speaks via video call from Iran, a bandage on her nose that she explains was caused by flying missile debris raining down on traffic. About a month ago, Sara and her husband, Fadi*, left their Adelaide home to help their Afghan family members, in Iran illegally, in hiding and in danger after fleeing the Taliban after the fall of Kabul in 2021. Now, Israel is contemplating retaliation for Iran\u2019s rocket attacks amid its escalating war with Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. The Australian government has told citizens not to travel to Iran. There are risks of missile strikes, terrorist attacks, kidnapping and a \u201chigh risk of arbitrary detention or arrest,\u201d according to the Smartraveller website. *Names have been changed For more on this story, read the full report from Guardian Australia\u2019s Tory Shepherd: The deputy leader of the opposition, Sussan Ley, says she has been \u201cheartened\u201d by how Corowa residents, on the New South Wales and Victorian border, have \u201ccondemned\u201d a rally of white supremacists. A group of white supremacists held a rally in the historic town, considered the birthplace of federation, on Saturday. The rally was moved on by police but no arrests have been made. Ley, whose electorate includes Corowa, described the rally attenders as \u201cthugs\u201d and said \u201cit is clear this is part of a strategy to shock and provoke using regional towns.\u201d I am heartened by reports that members of the community made it clear to these individuals that racism and hate has no place in Corowa. But I am saddened that this hate was forced upon members of my community, including many families who were simply enjoying their weekend, the day before the Corowa Show. I want to thank the New South Wales Police for dispersing this group of thugs and sending them out of our community. Ley said Australians \u201ccan not and should not tolerate gangs of balaclava covered thugs spouting hate anywhere in this country\u201d. She said the Coalition would give its support to federal and state authorities to \u201cto take whatever action is necessary to dismantle this organisation and stop these sorts of activities occurring\u201d. Australians should all be proud of the diversity of our multicultural nation. We must remember this group only represents an isolated minority made up of radicalised individuals, and that the vast majority of our country stands against them. We must redouble efforts to counter this radicalisation and equip our authorities with every necessary support to take stronger action. For every day of the past 23 years, I have been so privileged to represent the incredible people of Corowa, but as I reflect on the community\u2019s strength yesterday, I have never been prouder of them than I am today. Shadow immigration minister Dan Tehan has accused the Albanese government of not living up to its own rhetoric on the treatment of women in parliamentary workplaces. It comes after the deputy prime minister\u2019s chief of staff alleged she was moved out of her job and sidelined when she raised a complaint with her boss about bullying in the office. Guardian Australia reported last week that Jo Tarnawsky alleged Richard Marles forced her to take leave and told her to find another job when she raised her concerns with him on 30 April and has not spoken to her in five months. Tarnawsky, the government\u2019s second most senior chief of staff, subsequently made a public statement, accusing unnamed staff of bullying her and alleging the government\u2019s handling of the situation had been \u201ccowardly, cruel and completely unnecessary\u201d and had caused her deep distress. She did not accuse Marles of bullying. Marles said, through a spokesperson, that \u201ca number of the assertions and recollections are contested\u201d. Tarnawsky remains employed as chief of staff but was moved into a specially created temporary job that expired on 30 September. She said her employment future was unclear. Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Tehan said prime minister Anthony Albanese should clarify what his office knew about the situation and how long it would continue. There does seem to be serious questions that need to be answered. We just hope the government \u2013 because when they were in opposition they called for full transparency on these types of issues \u2013 will practise what they preach. Tehan suggested the issue demonstrated that Albanese had been inconsistent on the issue of workplace standards. They talked a big game when they were in opposition. So let\u2019s hope it can be dealt with respectfully and transparently. Marles told parliament on Thursday that Tarnawsky was a \u201cwonderful person\u201d and he was \u201cvery sad that events have got to where they have\u201d. Ms Tarnawsky remains a member of staff. Ms Tarnawsky has been treated with respect and courtesy. At all times, the wellbeing of staff, including Ms Tarnawsky, has been front of mind.

On front doorsteps in Brisbane\u2019s middle suburbs, LNP candidates campaigning for the Queensland election have started getting questions about abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming an issue \u2026 in places we thought we might win,\u201d says one party member. Two weeks ago, as the Queensland election campaign began, Labor social media posts suggesting the LNP had a \u201csecret plan\u201d to limit abortion rights and access were dismissed as a scare campaign. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, says his party has \u201cruled out\u201d changes to Labor\u2019s 2018 laws that decriminalised abortion. Abortion is, as Crisafulli says, \u201cnot a priority\u201d for the LNP. But it has quickly become a problem. For more on this story, read the full report by Guardian Australia\u2019s Ben Smee: Seeking to defy polling and deliver Labor a fourth straight term in government, Queensland premier Steven Miles will officially launch the party\u2019s election campaign on Sunday. The government has enjoyed almost a decade in power since Annastacia Palaszczuk ousted Campbell Newman in 2015, and with just 13 days until voters head to the poles, Miles is seeking to extend his party\u2019s tenure. Labor has governed Queensland for 30 of the past 35 years but polling has the party on track for defeat by 56 to 44 per cent on a two-party-preferred basis. Liberal National Party leader David Crisafulli is tipped to end Labor\u2019s nine-year reign after consistently leading the polls, campaigning hard on the election\u2019s key issues \u2013 health, youth crime, homes and cost of living pressures. Miles has promised to make school lunches free for every student in prep through to year six if re-elected. The proposal would kick off next year, saving parents $1600 a child, a year and benefiting 326,000 students. The proposal forms part of a broad progressive agenda that Miles is hoping will overcome the \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d factor weighing on his government. \u2013 with AAP PM\u2019s Tourette syndrome gaffe and subsequent apology shows he\u2019s a \u2018genuine bloke\u2019, assistant trade minister tells Sky The government is seeking to make a virtue of a difficult parliamentary week and the first anniversary of the failed Voice referendum. It is arguing the latter shows the Albanese government \u201cdoes what it says\u201d and that the PM\u2019s parliamentary gaffe about Tourette syndrome \u2013 for which he apologised \u2013 showed he was a \u201cgenuine bloke\u201d. Assistant trade minister Tim Ayres told Sky News on the eve of the referendum anniversary that proceeding with the vote was the government keeping a promise. One of the things you have to do is do what you say you\u2019re going to do and explain your way through these changes. Ahead of Monday\u2019s first anniversary of the referendum that rejected constitutionally enshrining an Indigenous Voice to parliament, some Indigenous leaders have said the vote should have been deferred. Ayres said: We argued the case for constitutional change. We respect the result that we got. I think a government that does what it says it is going to do is something that people should value and understand. He also defended the prime minister\u2019s leadership, both in the context of last week\u2019s parliamentary jibe accusing the shadow treasurer of having Tourette syndrome and then apologising, and more broadly since becoming Labor leader in 2019. The prime minister\u2019s like any other Australian. He said something in the heat of parliamentary debate. He didn\u2019t have to be dragged to a withdrawal \u2026 He\u2019s a genuine bloke who responded genuinely when he said something that he knew he shouldn\u2019t have said. Protesters dressed in red to \u2018represent the blood that connects all species\u2019 outside APGA convention to test SA\u2019s anti-protest laws Extinction Rebellion associated protesters will hold a demonstration outside the annual convention of the Australian Pipelines and Gas Association (APGA) in Adelaide on Sunday in what may become a test of the state\u2019s stringent anti-protest laws. A group dressed in red to \u201crepresent the blood that connects all species\u201d will \u201cwalk slowly to the beat of a single drum\u201d outside the Adelaide Convention Centre to \u201chighlight the devastating impact of fracking and gas extraction\u201d in the Beetaloo Basin in the NT, Extinction Rebellion SA spokesperson Anna Slynn said. Today\u2019s action is a message for the Adelaide community. The planet is heating up. Extreme weather events like the devastating cyclones in the US are increasing. It is not in our interest to be welcoming the fossil fuel industry to our state while we face the threat of another killer bush-fire season and long term drought. APGA is supported by companies including Santos, Woodside and Chevron, and the SA energy and mining minister, Tom Koutsantonis, is expected to give a keynote address. In May last year, Koutsantonis told the annual national oil and gas industry conference that the South Australian state government was \u201cat your disposal\u201d. For more on that story, read Guardian Australia\u2019s previous reporting: Coalition would consider mirroring US action on TikTok due to \u2018foreign interference risk\u2019, says Paterson Paterson has implied that the Coalition would consider taking similar action to the US on TikTok. The US government recently passed a bill requiring TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest itself of the social media platform owing to its relationship to the Chinese government. TikTok will pose a national security risk and particularly a foreign interference risk in our democracy. The US has taken action. The worrying thing is you might end up with a safer version of TikTok in the United States and a more dangerous version in Australia because we have been unwilling to take that action. And that\u2019s a wrap. Paterson says the Albanese government deserves credit for ending China\u2019s \u201ceconomic coercion campaign\u201d but has sought to cast the achievement as \u201ca bipartisan achievement\u201d. \u201cIt started in the Morrison government, it is continuing under the Albanese government,\u201d he said. Of course, it happened on the Albanese government\u2019s watch. They deserve some of credit for that, but it is a credit to Australia as a whole because the reason why the Chinese government has walked away from these sanctions is because they didn\u2019t work. Paterson says he wants to \u201clook closely\u201d about whether to ban Chinese-made electric vehicles in Australia because \u201cinternet connected vehicles are a national security and cybersecurity risk\u201d. So much so that the Biden administration is taking very tough action to eliminate them from their market. If our closest ally and friends think it is a concern, we should address it as well. However, Paterson said there were other ways of mitigating the risks, which may not necessarily involve an outright ban. For example, you can impose minimum cybersecurity standards that would lift the bar that all Internet devices like that have to meet, not just cars but other devices connected to the Internet. Tweet in support of Hamas enough ground to cancel visas, says Paterson Pushed on where the Coalition\u2019s position lands compared to Australia\u2019s international counterparts, Paterson said: Of course we aim to get to [a] ceasefire and aim to get to peace. I don\u2019t think that can happen unless Israel removes the very serious and existential problems it faces. On the cancellation of Palestinian visas, Patterson refers to statements by Asio head Mike Burgess, who said that anyone who liked a tweet showing support for Hamas \u201cconstitutes a security threat to Australia\u201d. He said that this should be enough ground to cancel someone\u2019s visa. Paterson said that visas can be refused not just on security grounds but on character grounds and that should be used to cancel the visas of those who express support for groups like Hamas or Hezbollah. Wounding of UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon \u2018unfortunate \u2026 if that is the case\u2019, says Paterson Paterson says he would have concerns about the wounding of UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon \u201cif that is the case, that [it was] IDF action that wounded US peacekeepers\u201d. That would have been very unfortunate and very regrettable. It should be investigated and should not happen. Paterson is canvassed on the position of other world leaders, particularly the G7 leaders, who have called for a ceasefire and whether that means the Coalition is out of step with Australia\u2019s international allies. Paterson: On 26 September, Australia with some other nations, called for a ceasefire in Lebanon. Had Israel followed that advice, Hassan Nasrallah would still be alive today, the former head of Hezbollah. Asked about the Coalition position on a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, Paterson said that it could only happen when Hezbollah had been \u201cdegraded and defeated\u201d. This is at odds with the position of US President Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris, who have called for a de-escalation and ceasefire. Patterson said: \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be remarkable for an Australian politician to disagree with an American politician.\u201d The administration under Biden and Kamala Harris is centre left. I\u2019m from centre [the] right. We can be open and honest as mature adults about where we disagree. Pushed on whether the Coalition is out of step with the position of Australia\u2019s biggest ally, the US, Patterson said: Yes, on questions of principle, [the Coalition] are very strong supporters of Israel. We understand the circumstances they face. God forbid Australia ever faces challenges that Israel faces. God forbid that Australian politicians are ever faced with these choices, but if we would expect their Government to respond as decisively as Israel has. PM must have \u2018have the courage of his convictions\u2019 and \u2018op up\u2019 when in disagreement with US, James Paterson says Shadow home affairs minister James Paterson says prime minister Anthony Albanese should \u201chave the courage of his convictions\u201d and \u201cjust be honest and op up\u201d about where he disagrees with the United States. Paterson said the PM \u201cclearly\u201d disagreed with the United States over Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza and southern Lebanon. It\u2019s not a remarkable thing that Australia could come to a different judgment from the United States. We are our own sovereign country. The problem here is that the prime minister doesn\u2019t have the courage of his own convictions. Regressive steps and broken promises failing to close the gap, says peak Aboriginal group Monday will mark the first anniversary of the national referendum that voted against creating an indigenous voice to parliament. The peak body for Aboriginal community-controlled groups has taken the moment to check progress against a previous key moment \u2013 the signing of the national Closing the Gap agreement in 2020. The Coalition of Peaks, representing more than 80 peak groups, says there have been regressive steps on youth justice and broken promises on funding and steps to make government services accountable. Patricia Turner, the coalition\u2019s lead convener and Gudanji-Arrernte woman, says there has also been \u201creal progress\u201d in areas, such as employment and early childhood education. But the changes have to be systemic and they have to be long-term. There\u2019s important work still to do to make sure the rubber\u2019s hitting the road, funding is getting to communities, and governments are truly changing. The new NT government wants to cut the age of criminal responsibility to 10 and Victoria had walked back plans to lift the age to 14. Turner said: Imprisoning vulnerable children, many of whom have developmental delays that make their decision-making capacity that of seven or eight-year-olds, flies in the face of what State and Territory Governments signed up to under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap. A 2020 agreement signed by all governments pledged that by the end of 2023 each would create Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander-led bodies to improve the way they work with those communities. The coalition said: To date, none of them have. Turner said dedicated funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled organisations was also falling short, seeing \u201cmoney wasted on programs that aren\u2019t designed by us, and don\u2019t work for us\u201d. About 2,400 evacuees from Lebanon have now landed in Australia as the federal government prepares to end its evacuation program. Demand for help leaving Beirut in the wake of Israel\u2019s attacks on southern Lebanon has fallen in recent days, with less than 180 people on board flights to Cyprus that left on Friday. The last two government-chartered flights will leave Beirut on Sunday before the Albanese government ends the operation. Two more government-chartered repatriation flights landed in Sydney on Saturday evening, carrying hundreds of Australians and their family members. One final Qantas flight is due to leave Cyprus on Wednesday evening. The arrived passengers add to the 2,135 who have already arrived on long-haul flights chartered by Australia. Australians and their family members still in Lebanon will need to resort to local flag carrier Middle East Airlines or other commercial outfits. More than 2,200 people have been killed and another 1.2 million have been displaced across Lebanon, a nation about the size of Melbourne or Sydney. - AAP The assistant trade minister Tim Ayres and shadow immigration minister Dan Tehan have appeared on Sky News this morning, and the Coalition\u2019s shadow home affairs minister James Paterson is speaking to ABC Insiders host David Speers shortly. We will bring you the latest as it happens. And welcome to another Sunday Guardian live blog. Almost 2,500 people have returned to Australia from Lebanon as the government is preparing to end its repatriation flights. The program began during Israel\u2019s attacks on southern Lebanon but with falling numbers taking up the opportunity to evacuate, the last two government-chartered flights are expected to leave Beirut on Sunday after two landed in Sydney on Saturday night. Monday will mark the one-year anniversary of the failed voice to parliament referendum, with Australia\u2019s peak Aboriginal group using the moment to check in on the country\u2019s efforts to close the gap. A body representing 80 peak groups says the last year has been characterised by backward steps and broken promises. I\u2019m Royce Kurmelovs and I\u2019ll be taking the blog through the day.

      "bodyText": "As night closed in on Nedd Brockmann\u2019s quest to run 1,000 miles (1,609.3km) in 10 days, the loneliness of Australia\u2019s favourite long-distance runner could be felt by every member of a 1000-strong crowd who crowded into Sydney Olympic Park on Sunday to cheer him home. The former tradie turned endurance athlete was in agony \u2013 and frequently, in tears. By 5pm on the 10th night, Brockmann, 25, from the New South Wales central west, had covered 1,322.62km. He had run every day for 16-20 hours a day around a 400-metre athletics track. He had raised over $1.3m in donations for charity. But his body was failing him. \u201cNedd has been in pain every day of this challenge,\u201d said support team leader James Ward. \u201cHe\u2019s got issues with his shins, knees, shoulders. It\u2019s got to the point where he needs us to put him in a wheelchair every morning to get him on the track. But so long as the donations keep coming in, he thinks all the pain is worthwhile.\u201d By Sunday, the blisters on Brockmann\u2019s feet were raw and bleeding. Despite wearing shoes three sizes too large to combat the discomfort, there were times he could barely walk, let alone run, in his effort to meet the astonishing target of four marathons every day. \u201cIt is so relentless that track \u2026 it has been hell \u2026 and that\u2019s why I love it,\u201d Brockmann told his followers in a social media clip. By then his \u201cUncomfortable Challenge\u201d had drawn 2.7m views to TikTok for what did prove uncomfortable \u2013 yet undoubtedly inspiring \u2013 footage. Brockmann had his eyes on a record set by the greatest ultra runner of all time, Yiannis Kouros, who ran 1,000 miles in 10 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes and 36 seconds in New York in 1988. It was a typically audacious target and, by Sunday, it looked out of reach. But with the crowd cheering from the bleachers, Brockmann soldiered on. \u201cThe record might be out of reach for Nedd but he\u2019s not stopping,\u201d said Ward, who met Brockmann in 2020 when the 21-year-old sparkie ran 50 marathons in 50 days to raise more than $100,000 for the Red Cross. \u201cNedd is an incredible character. When he hit $1.3m in donations today he burst into tears. Then he kept on running.\u201d Brockmann first captured the hearts of the nation in 2022 with an extraordinary 46-day run of 4,000km across Australia that raised $1.85m for We Are Mobilise, an outreach program combatting homelessness. Six weeks after he set off in Western Australia, a crowd of over 10,000 people cheered the cult hero across the line at Bondi beach. This challenge was shorter but steeper \u2013 and far more gruelling. \u201cYiannis Kouros\u2019s feat of endurance is simply mindblowing,\u201d Brockmann had written on Instagram ahead of setting out. \u201cHowever, if you\u2019re going to do something, don\u2019t go in half-assed, throw everything at it. Everything.\u201d Over the past 10 days, the former electrician has certainly done that, eating and sleeping at the track in a tent under the grandstand. Brockmann has been mostly running at night to avoid the heat, and sleeping by day, and stuck to a strict refuelling schedule. His mother, Kylie, and father, Ian, have been cheering his every step, and boxing champion Harry Garside and comedian Hamish Blake have turned up at the track to run beside him. On day eight, with with the record slipping away, Brockmann changed tactics. Instead of tackling each 100-mile (161.1km) in 20-hour blocks virtually non-stop over a day, he began to work in \u201c17-hour sessions\u201d: running big miles, resting a few hours, then going again.

And the other was affirming that she saw the right thing. It was fascinating. I thought, nobody\u2019s gonna make a movie about these two, but that\u2019s who most of us are. Right?\u201d</p> <p>In her 40-year career, which has spanned auteur\u2019s art films like the exquisite <em>Safe</em>, to huge blockbusters like <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/22/the-hunger-games-review\">The Hunger Games</a></em>, as well as award-winning dramas like <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/08/still-alice-review-julianne-moore-superb-alzheimers\">Still Alice</a></em> (for which, after many nominations, she won her Oscar in 2014) and recent TV work like the audacious <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/mar/05/mary-george-review-julianne-moore-has-ludicrously-good-fun-in-17th-century-raunchfest\">Mary </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/mar/05/mary-george-review-julianne-moore-has-ludicrously-good-fun-in-17th-century-raunchfest\">&amp; George</a></em>, Moore has played characters who are defiant and struggling, sometimes deviant, trapped in an often-gorgeous prison of domestic horror.</p> <p>As a child, she moved 20 times, first across the US and then to Germany with her brother and mother, a psychiatric social worker, following the trajectory of her father\u2019s military career. Whenever she started at a new school, she\u2019d quietly watch how the students danced, how they talked, quickly learning how to fit in, a skill she transferred to acting, first in a soap opera in 1984, and then on film.</p>    <p>On the subway, as in film roles, she\u2019s interested in \u201creality and complexity\u201d rather than fantasy. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone personally who\u2019s been to the moon; I\u2019ve never met a queen,\u201d she explains. \u201cYet there are lots of movies about queens. Even though I have had incredible privilege and met people who\u2019ve done amazing things, the majority of my experience and relationships are with people living regular lives. Nobody\u2019s a magician, nobody\u2019s a wizard, no one is in outer space. Real people\u2019s lives are rich and extraordinary and wonderful and I like to see them examined \u2013 I like to examine them, too.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re meeting to talk about her new film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/02/the-room-next-door-review-almodovar-venice-film-festival-tilda-swinton-julianne-moore\">The Room Next Door</a></em>. It\u2019s a lush, lovely exploration of mortality and, because it\u2019s by Pedro Almod\u00f3var (his first English-language feature), it includes the art direction of a character\u2019s death, down to the colour of their final lipstick. \u201cThere is this elevated visual sense,\u201d Moore says, of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s films. \u201cWomen look beautiful, the world looks beautiful.\u201d Even death looks beautiful. \u201cThere are filmmakers who say: this world is harsh, so the film\u2019s going to look rough. No one\u2019s going to be lit. It\u2019s going to look real,\u201d she goes on. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, <em>does</em> life look like that? <em>Does</em> life look harsh? Is that reality? Pedro sees beauty: in big piles of fruit, wonderful books, the jackets people wear and the lipstick they have on. And it feels like a feast, you know? A celebration, I think, of life.\u201d</p> <p>Moore plays Ingrid, who is reunited with an old friend, Martha (played by Tilda Swinton), in a hospital room. The room overlooks a Manhattan cityscape on which, so enchanting is Martha\u2019s receding life, pink snow falls. She decides to rent a house somewhere beautiful to take a euthanasia pill, and asks Ingrid to be there, in the room next door. It\u2019s a tender, strange film, a duet about friendship, time and the end. Its beauty reads as defiance. In response to an old lover, a lecturer on the climate crisis, Ingrid says, \u201cYou can\u2019t go around telling people there\u2019s no hope. There are a lot of ways to live inside a tragedy.\u201d The line has come back to me since at odd times; pouring milk, scrolling news.</p>    <p>\u201cWhen Pedro\u2019s films begin, the canvas feels kind of vast and personal to him,\u201d Moore says. \u201cBy the time you finishthe film, it feels very small and personal to you.\u201d At the Venice premiere, the crowd applauded for 17 minutes, almost a sixth of the running time of the film. The ovation became its own news story. \u201cThat feeling of reciprocity was wonderful,\u201d Almod\u00f3var tells me. \u201cI felt the audience had understood what we wanted to tell them.\u201d But \u201cthe ovation was so long that, after exchanging hugs and kisses with Julianne, Tilda and my brother, we didn\u2019t know what else to do, except smile and put our hands on our hearts\u201d.</p> <p>Almod\u00f3var wanted Moore for the role because he knew she could appear \u201cterrified, friendly, compassionate, angry, understanding, stony, slightly eccentric, tender, empathetic but without going too far, fearful and daring at the same time\u201d, he says. After sending Swinton the script, Almod\u00f3var asked her who she thought should play Ingrid. Swinton emails me, remembering: \u201cMy heart was pounding in case he said a different name. Our emails crossed: they both said JULIE. Hallelujah!\u201d Swinton and Moore had circled each other\u2019s orbits for years, but, she says, \u201ccoming together in this way was a particular blessing. It gave us the chance to catch up on each other\u2019s entire lives \u2013 from morning to night \u2013 and in between set-ups, Pedro was always marvelling: \u2018You two are always talking talking talking!\u2019 What grace to have such a way of becoming friends,\u201d she adds, \u201cwhich we now most assuredly are.\u201d</p> <p>After the premiere, people approached Moore to discuss first the film and then themselves. Almod\u00f3var\u2019s work, she sighs, \u201cmakes people want to reveal themselves more because they feel so seen by the experience. What he\u2019s done with this film is really encapsulate what it means to witness someone,\u201d Moore says, \u201cto accompany them during a passage of mortality. For me and Tilda, of course, it brings all of that into relief. It brings it back to how you can experience your life, I think, in a more complete way, in a more present way.\u201d Sometimes the process was painful, she admits. They were shooting in Madrid, away from her husband (film director Bart Freundlich, who she met while shooting his film <em>The Myth of Fingerprints</em> in 1996) and their two adult children, and the subject matter was, she says with a slow nod, \u201cheavy\u201d. But at the same time, \u201csort of wonderful, because you go, \u2018I need to be awake. I need to be alive to the idea of mortality all the time\u2019.\u201d</p>    <p>It\u2019s fairly early in the morning to be talking about death, but Almod\u00f3var\u2019s film, she agrees, requires it. \u201cHis movies are like a dream,\u201d Moore smiles, \u201cThey\u2019re not quite real, but their themes are so real \u2013 it\u2019s personal, it\u2019s political. It\u2019s all of the stuff of life.\u201d On the political, I ask, how does she deal with the themes, like death and the climate emergency, he explores? She briefly hoots. For a second I worry I should have asked, perhaps, about her skincare routine, or favourite colour. \u201cNo, but sometimes I feel challenged, because I\u2019m just a human being, called upon to make big proclamations about the end of the world!\u201d Still, I wait.</p> <p>\u201cYou try to be a good person. You know, you try to be alive. You try to do what you can do in your own sphere and reach as far as you can.\u201d She loves the Nick Hornby book, <em>How To Be Good</em>, because, \u201cat the end, the only conclusion he reaches is that: you can\u2019t. Instead, you find solace in art and in time and in relationships. People love narrative \u2013 we all love a beginning, a middle and an end. But we don\u2019t have that in life until we\u2019re dead. And then we don\u2019t even know what the story is, because we\u2019re not there to see the end. So, in fact, we have this expectation that life is going to be like this \u2026\u201d a) leading to b), leading to c), etc, \u201cand that we can contain it. We keep telling these stories so we have that kind of solace. But I feel as if life is more like this\u2026\u201d She mimes a long, wobbly line. \u201cIt spreads out horizontally and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going. And so it\u2019s \u2026 a challenge!\u201d</p> <p>A number of directors Moore has worked with have talked about her magical way with silence, the things she says when she\u2019s saying nothing. \u201cOne of the best things about Julianne, aside from an extraordinary talent for both comedy and drama, is a physique that allows her to play any kind of character with the same intensity,\u201d Almod\u00f3var tells me. \u201cAnd she knows how to listen. She also has a fantastic deep voice,\u201d he adds, thoughtfully. \u201cShe should sing.\u201d Moore explains, slowly \u2013 on screen: \u201cYou\u2019re always looking for what feels human. One of the things about acting that\u2019s always challenging is that you have to do all of this work, then also be ready to abandon it so that it actually happens to you. So I think part of being silent is letting something occur to you while you\u2019re actually on camera.\u201d</p>    <p>Are these sorts of lessons in acting also useful for real life? \u201cThey really are, because so often in life we have an expectation about how something\u2019s going to happen. Then, just when I think I\u2019m open to any possibility, something comes and surprises me. In acting, you want to try to be skinless. Because you want to have those things happen to you. It\u2019s about getting those barriers down. In life, it\u2019s very hard to be that way, because you want to protect yourself. But I think, ultimately, you\u2019re more in touch with who you are and what you want and how you communicate if you can be that way.\u201d Raw and skinless. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard!\u201d</p> <p>On stage or film, \u201cthere\u2019s this tremendous freedom. I don\u2019t know why some of us like doing that. And other people find their freedom in other places. But I can metabolise a lot of feelings and ideas while I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p> <p>Where else does she find freedom? \u201cIn relationships. Friendship. I find a lot of freedom just walking around, too. I like to read, I love design, I love ceramics.\u201d At my request, she scrabbles around to find a bowl she\u2019s made. It\u2019s about two palms wide, gold and glinting in the light. She made a whole collection cast in bronze and sold them to benefit a gun-safety organisation. \u201cI said to the bronze artist,\u201d Moore laughs, \u201c\u2018Oh my God, it looks so amazing!\u2019 She said, \u2018The secret is, everything looks good in bronze!\u2019\u201d She loves making ceramics, she says, holding the bowl, as, \u201cevidence of time\u201d.</p> <p>When her children were little, 20 years ago, they\u2019d visit her on set for lunch. \u201cBeing a parent, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of compartmentalisation that occurs. But I liked the fact I had other responsibilities, other things to tend to.\u201d Her son was three when she was filming <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/14/artsfeatures\">The Hours </a></em>with Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep, \u201cand he was with me the entire time. One of my biggest concerns was getting home, because he wouldn\u2019t go to sleep until I was in the bed with him. My character was very depressed, and oh, it was all very complicated. He didn\u2019t like the fact my character was pregnant \u2013 he would knock on my belly, try to take it off.\u201d She was 37 when she had her first child but, \u201cpeople have been asking me about age since I was 28. Often I\u2019ll be interviewed and they\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry to ask this question, my editors said I had to\u2026\u2019 Because people think women want to read about it.\u201d What do you think? \u201cI think no one wants to be defined by how old they are.Children don\u2019t like being told, \u2018Well, you\u2019re this age, therefore X.\u2019 And when you are 30, you don\u2019t want to be told, \u2018You\u2019re 30, you should start worrying,\u2019 and when you\u2019re 60, you don\u2019t want people telling you, \u2018Don\u2019t you think we should be wrapping this up now?\u2019 It feels like a very tight way to define someone when, in fact, everybody is just having experiences of\u2026 being alive.\u201d She takes a gentle, exasperated breath.</p> <p>\u201cWe all have a life cycle. We feel as if we\u2019re always in the middle and we don\u2019t know the end. Sometimes the age questions are really about business, you know, but then the deeper question,\u201d she leans in, stagily, \u201cand here we\u2019re getting back to the dark part of this interview\u2026 the deeper question is about mortality.\u201d She remembers something Gloria Steinem said: if women don\u2019t have equality, they will continue to be valued only for their youth and beauty. \u201cBut if you do have autonomy, if you do have agency, then where you are in your life doesn\u2019t really matter \u2013 you want to be able to experience all of it and know all of it has value.\u201d</p>    <p>We meander back to the women on the subway, the idea that each claimed to know who they were. \u201cWell my God, we all want that, don\u2019t we! The thing about identity, though, is that it\u2019s always shifting.\u201d Does she ever discover more about who she is through the characters she plays? \u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I do it! It gives you a space to examine your feelings. I think when people talk about feeling cut off from themselves, it can be painful. And I think that for a lot of us doing this,\u201d by this she means acting, \u201cyou do feel like there is a place where I can kind of mess around with my feelings.\u201d</p> <p>She felt it in the scenes with Swinton as Martha in hospital, a recognition, and an understanding that while you might not be able to save someone, you can help simply by being there. She repeats the line, with weight: \u201cThere are lots of ways to live inside a tragedy,\u201d whether a hospital room, a war, or a broken planet. \u201cLife is hard, death is hard, sorrow is hard, grief, all of these things that we live with. You can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, forget it. I withdraw.\u2019 You have to be present with it. You live with it.\u201d She nods. \u201cThis is what life is. We have children and we go to the movies and we talk like this. We persist!\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re staring at each other now, a sort of mutual terror on the table between us, and I find myself apologising for asking questions about the horrors of being alive on such a fine morning and she chuckles merrily while pulling the band from her ponytail. \u201cNo <em>I\u2019m</em> sorry,\u201d she says. But, there\u2019s always more than one thing happening at the same time, she reminds me \u2013 there\u2019s always the tragedy, \u201cthe brutality\u201d, as well as the beauty, and the quotidian reality of a woman\u2019s working day. \u201cBecause, this entire time\u2026\u201d talking about, for instance, how to live when death is real, she smiles, \u201cI\u2019ve also been deep conditioning my hair.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Room Next Door is in cinemas from 25 October</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Yesterday Julianne Moore was on the subway in New York, listening discreetly to strangers. \u201cI was sitting there and I heard one woman say, \u2018Well, I know that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d do, I know that\u2019s what you\u2019re like.\u2019 And the other woman said, \u2018It\u2019s true, I just don\u2019t like confrontation, I don\u2019t!\u2019\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s distracting, the idea that Moore, not only an Oscar-winning actor, but one whose airy beauty and long red hair (red hair that an early director warned would limit her career, ha) makes her one of the most recognisable people in the world, could pass unnoticed through a carriage of chattering commuters. But please remember \u2013 or trust me \u2013 that part of Moore\u2019s talent is the ability to transform, to step back from herself. She is a 63-year-old character actor in the body of a movie star. Anyway: \u201cIt was so amazing, because it was these two female friends,\u201d Moore goes on, \u201cand one was saying, \u2018I know you, I see you\u2019. And the other was affirming that she saw the right thing. It was fascinating. I thought, nobody\u2019s gonna make a movie about these two, but that\u2019s who most of us are. Right?\u201d In her 40-year career, which has spanned auteur\u2019s art films like the exquisite Safe, to huge blockbusters like The Hunger Games, as well as award-winning dramas like Still Alice (for which, after many nominations, she won her Oscar in 2014) and recent TV work like the audacious Mary &amp; George, Moore has played characters who are defiant and struggling, sometimes deviant, trapped in an often-gorgeous prison of domestic horror. As a child, she moved 20 times, first across the US and then to Germany with her brother and mother, a psychiatric social worker, following the trajectory of her father\u2019s military career. Whenever she started at a new school, she\u2019d quietly watch how the students danced, how they talked, quickly learning how to fit in, a skill she transferred to acting, first in a soap opera in 1984, and then on film. On the subway, as in film roles, she\u2019s interested in \u201creality and complexity\u201d rather than fantasy. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone personally who\u2019s been to the moon; I\u2019ve never met a queen,\u201d she explains. \u201cYet there are lots of movies about queens. Even though I have had incredible privilege and met people who\u2019ve done amazing things, the majority of my experience and relationships are with people living regular lives. Nobody\u2019s a magician, nobody\u2019s a wizard, no one is in outer space. Real people\u2019s lives are rich and extraordinary and wonderful and I like to see them examined \u2013 I like to examine them, too.\u201d We\u2019re meeting to talk about her new film, The Room Next Door.

But I feel as if life is more like this\u2026\u201d She mimes a long, wobbly line. \u201cIt spreads out horizontally and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going. And so it\u2019s \u2026 a challenge!\u201d A number of directors Moore has worked with have talked about her magical way with silence, the things she says when she\u2019s saying nothing. \u201cOne of the best things about Julianne, aside from an extraordinary talent for both comedy and drama, is a physique that allows her to play any kind of character with the same intensity,\u201d Almod\u00f3var tells me. \u201cAnd she knows how to listen. She also has a fantastic deep voice,\u201d he adds, thoughtfully. \u201cShe should sing.\u201d Moore explains, slowly \u2013 on screen: \u201cYou\u2019re always looking for what feels human. One of the things about acting that\u2019s always challenging is that you have to do all of this work, then also be ready to abandon it so that it actually happens to you. So I think part of being silent is letting something occur to you while you\u2019re actually on camera.\u201d Are these sorts of lessons in acting also useful for real life? \u201cThey really are, because so often in life we have an expectation about how something\u2019s going to happen. Then, just when I think I\u2019m open to any possibility, something comes and surprises me. In acting, you want to try to be skinless. Because you want to have those things happen to you. It\u2019s about getting those barriers down. In life, it\u2019s very hard to be that way, because you want to protect yourself. But I think, ultimately, you\u2019re more in touch with who you are and what you want and how you communicate if you can be that way.\u201d Raw and skinless. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard!\u201d On stage or film, \u201cthere\u2019s this tremendous freedom. I don\u2019t know why some of us like doing that. And other people find their freedom in other places. But I can metabolise a lot of feelings and ideas while I\u2019m doing it.\u201d Where else does she find freedom? \u201cIn relationships. Friendship. I find a lot of freedom just walking around, too. I like to read, I love design, I love ceramics.\u201d At my request, she scrabbles around to find a bowl she\u2019s made. It\u2019s about two palms wide, gold and glinting in the light. She made a whole collection cast in bronze and sold them to benefit a gun-safety organisation. \u201cI said to the bronze artist,\u201d Moore laughs, \u201c\u2018Oh my God, it looks so amazing!\u2019 She said, \u2018The secret is, everything looks good in bronze!\u2019\u201d She loves making ceramics, she says, holding the bowl, as, \u201cevidence of time\u201d. When her children were little, 20 years ago, they\u2019d visit her on set for lunch. \u201cBeing a parent, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of compartmentalisation that occurs. But I liked the fact I had other responsibilities, other things to tend to.\u201d Her son was three when she was filming The Hours with Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep, \u201cand he was with me the entire time. One of my biggest concerns was getting home, because he wouldn\u2019t go to sleep until I was in the bed with him. My character was very depressed, and oh, it was all very complicated. He didn\u2019t like the fact my character was pregnant \u2013 he would knock on my belly, try to take it off.\u201d She was 37 when she had her first child but, \u201cpeople have been asking me about age since I was 28. Often I\u2019ll be interviewed and they\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry to ask this question, my editors said I had to\u2026\u2019 Because people think women want to read about it.\u201d What do you think? \u201cI think no one wants to be defined by how old they are.Children don\u2019t like being told, \u2018Well, you\u2019re this age, therefore X.\u2019 And when you are 30, you don\u2019t want to be told, \u2018You\u2019re 30, you should start worrying,\u2019 and when you\u2019re 60, you don\u2019t want people telling you, \u2018Don\u2019t you think we should be wrapping this up now?\u2019 It feels like a very tight way to define someone when, in fact, everybody is just having experiences of\u2026 being alive.\u201d She takes a gentle, exasperated breath. \u201cWe all have a life cycle. We feel as if we\u2019re always in the middle and we don\u2019t know the end. Sometimes the age questions are really about business, you know, but then the deeper question,\u201d she leans in, stagily, \u201cand here we\u2019re getting back to the dark part of this interview\u2026 the deeper question is about mortality.\u201d She remembers something Gloria Steinem said: if women don\u2019t have equality, they will continue to be valued only for their youth and beauty. \u201cBut if you do have autonomy, if you do have agency, then where you are in your life doesn\u2019t really matter \u2013 you want to be able to experience all of it and know all of it has value.\u201d We meander back to the women on the subway, the idea that each claimed to know who they were. \u201cWell my God, we all want that, don\u2019t we! The thing about identity, though, is that it\u2019s always shifting.\u201d Does she ever discover more about who she is through the characters she plays? \u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I do it! It gives you a space to examine your feelings. I think when people talk about feeling cut off from themselves, it can be painful. And I think that for a lot of us doing this,\u201d by this she means acting, \u201cyou do feel like there is a place where I can kind of mess around with my feelings.\u201d She felt it in the scenes with Swinton as Martha in hospital, a recognition, and an understanding that while you might not be able to save someone, you can help simply by being there. She repeats the line, with weight: \u201cThere are lots of ways to live inside a tragedy,\u201d whether a hospital room, a war, or a broken planet. \u201cLife is hard, death is hard, sorrow is hard, grief, all of these things that we live with. You can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, forget it. I withdraw.\u2019 You have to be present with it. You live with it.\u201d She nods. \u201cThis is what life is. We have children and we go to the movies and we talk like this. We persist!\u201d We\u2019re staring at each other now, a sort of mutual terror on the table between us, and I find myself apologising for asking questions about the horrors of being alive on such a fine morning and she chuckles merrily while pulling the band from her ponytail. \u201cNo I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. But, there\u2019s always more than one thing happening at the same time, she reminds me \u2013 there\u2019s always the tragedy, \u201cthe brutality\u201d, as well as the beauty, and the quotidian reality of a woman\u2019s working day. \u201cBecause, this entire time\u2026\u201d talking about, for instance, how to live when death is real, she smiles, \u201cI\u2019ve also been deep conditioning my hair.\u201d The Room Next Door is in cinemas from 25 October",

      "body": "<h2>Dear Howard,</h2> <p>I write more in sorrow than in anger. You\u2019ve acknowledged that we are a \u201cdisputatious people\u201d so I know you will take this response in the spirit in which it is offered. I have relished every book you\u2019ve written since your very first novel, <em>Coming from Behind</em>, was published in 1983. Much of your writing has resonated: your acuity about campus politics, your refusal to disavow, nay your pride, in your particular ethnic version of the Mancunian working class and your fine satirical instincts.</p> <p>Unlike your first editor, the late Carmen Callil, I don\u2019t object to your \u201cmasculinist\u201d point of view. If your special subject seems to be the penis who am I to argue?</p> <p>Howard, in my favourite of all your books, <em>Roots Schmoots</em>, you acknowledge that Our People are \u201csmitten with their own tragedy\u201d. But that tragedy and your smittenness seem to have overwhelmed your capacity for empathy for the other contemporary tragedy \u2013 that of the Palestinian right to self-determination and sovereignty.</p> <p>Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/06/tales-of-infanticide-have-stoked-hatred-of-jews-for-centuries-they-echo-still-today\">latest jeremiad</a> argues that antisemitism is the ur-racism, exceptional and eternal. I share your alertness to antisemitism. My mother was regularly called Mrs Goldberg. I said nothing when a chair of a publishing company I led asked whether a P&amp;L statement was \u201cJewish accounting\u201d. I\u2019ve lost count of the times I\u2019ve watched people tapping the side of their noses to suggest shrewdness, a nose for making a deal. However, I am surprised that \u201cour\u201d tragedy has left you unable to recognise that the occupation has morally corrupted Israeli society, that successive Israeli governments have colluded to oppress Palestinians, destroy their lives, their homes, and ensured the impossibility of any prospect of justice or peace.</p> <p>You suspect the western media of propaganda when, in reality, there has been a remarkable lack of representation of life in Gaza since 7 October. I\u2019m not sure where you were last weekend but the epic column inches devoted to the Israeli victims of 7 October does not suggest a failure to give due regard to their suffering. Indeed, what was almost entirely missing, or at best appeared as an afterthought, was any attention to the consequence of that day for Palestinians. This isn\u2019t a call for both-siderism \u2013 I take Jacqueline Rose\u2019s (one of your Ashamed Jews) view that \u201cbalance is a corrupt term in an unbalanced world\u201d.</p> <p>One should not ignore the horror of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/the-middle-east-in-crisis-7-october-the-day-that-changed-the-world\">atrocities committed on 7 October</a> in the left-wing kibbutzim that Netanyahu and his cronies assiduously and cynically ignored for the last 15 years, nor should one ignore the nightmare for families who await, with dread, news of loved ones still held hostage in Gaza. But Howard, I wonder how you can push to one side the 40,000-plus Gazans murdered in the last 12 months because you\u2019re preoccupied by what you describe as that most ancient hatred.</p> <p>You write, \u201cit is hateful to be accused of what you haven\u2019t done, but more hateful still to be accused of what you would never dream of doing and what you cannot bear to see done\u201d<em>. </em>I wonder whether perhaps you hadn\u2019t noticed the TikTok efforts of proud IDF soldiers, the religious fundamentalist settlers\u2019 brutal treatment of Palestinians, who Yoav Gallant calls \u201c human animals\u201d, or the obscene crimes against Palestinians prisoners at Sde Teiman prison in a state that promotes itself as the only democracy in the region. The evidence seems to refute your high-minded idea of Jewish people as incapable of barbarism.</p> <p>You seamlessly conflate Jewish\u00adness and Israel.

      "bodyText": "Dear Howard, I write more in sorrow than in anger. You\u2019ve acknowledged that we are a \u201cdisputatious people\u201d so I know you will take this response in the spirit in which it is offered. I have relished every book you\u2019ve written since your very first novel, Coming from Behind, was published in 1983. Much of your writing has resonated: your acuity about campus politics, your refusal to disavow, nay your pride, in your particular ethnic version of the Mancunian working class and your fine satirical instincts. Unlike your first editor, the late Carmen Callil, I don\u2019t object to your \u201cmasculinist\u201d point of view. If your special subject seems to be the penis who am I to argue? Howard, in my favourite of all your books, Roots Schmoots, you acknowledge that Our People are \u201csmitten with their own tragedy\u201d. But that tragedy and your smittenness seem to have overwhelmed your capacity for empathy for the other contemporary tragedy \u2013 that of the Palestinian right to self-determination and sovereignty. Your latest jeremiad argues that antisemitism is the ur-racism, exceptional and eternal. I share your alertness to antisemitism. My mother was regularly called Mrs Goldberg. I said nothing when a chair of a publishing company I led asked whether a P&amp;L statement was \u201cJewish accounting\u201d. I\u2019ve lost count of the times I\u2019ve watched people tapping the side of their noses to suggest shrewdness, a nose for making a deal. However, I am surprised that \u201cour\u201d tragedy has left you unable to recognise that the occupation has morally corrupted Israeli society, that successive Israeli governments have colluded to oppress Palestinians, destroy their lives, their homes, and ensured the impossibility of any prospect of justice or peace. You suspect the western media of propaganda when, in reality, there has been a remarkable lack of representation of life in Gaza since 7 October. I\u2019m not sure where you were last weekend but the epic column inches devoted to the Israeli victims of 7 October does not suggest a failure to give due regard to their suffering. Indeed, what was almost entirely missing, or at best appeared as an afterthought, was any attention to the consequence of that day for Palestinians. This isn\u2019t a call for both-siderism \u2013 I take Jacqueline Rose\u2019s (one of your Ashamed Jews) view that \u201cbalance is a corrupt term in an unbalanced world\u201d. One should not ignore the horror of the atrocities committed on 7 October in the left-wing kibbutzim that Netanyahu and his cronies assiduously and cynically ignored for the last 15 years, nor should one ignore the nightmare for families who await, with dread, news of loved ones still held hostage in Gaza. But Howard, I wonder how you can push to one side the 40,000-plus Gazans murdered in the last 12 months because you\u2019re preoccupied by what you describe as that most ancient hatred. You write, \u201cit is hateful to be accused of what you haven\u2019t done, but more hateful still to be accused of what you would never dream of doing and what you cannot bear to see done\u201d. I wonder whether perhaps you hadn\u2019t noticed the TikTok efforts of proud IDF soldiers, the religious fundamentalist settlers\u2019 brutal treatment of Palestinians, who Yoav Gallant calls \u201c human animals\u201d, or the obscene crimes against Palestinians prisoners at Sde Teiman prison in a state that promotes itself as the only democracy in the region. The evidence seems to refute your high-minded idea of Jewish people as incapable of barbarism. You seamlessly conflate Jewishness and Israel. I assume for you that connection is obvious as it is for the majority of diaspora Jews. So I assume you don\u2019t mind being held accountable for the actions of the current government, given your essay evidences no dissent. However, if you are uncomfortable with the reality of the Israeli state today, then perhaps you should reconsider your allegiance to Zionism \u2013 rather than asking to enjoy your nightly viewing without being exposed to its deadly manifestation in the form of maimed babies, among other things. Almost as ancient as the hatred that preoccupies you is the rhetorical question: will this war on Gaza be good for the Jews? I think not. Yours, Louise Louise Adler is a former publisher",

But those sailors, some of whom were coincidentally hoping to find a mythical fountain of youth, left port without knowing what really lay ahead. The same is true for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/14/my-ultimate-goal-dont-die-bryan-johnson-on-his-controversial-plan-to-live-for-ever\">Johnson</a>, 47, who sees himself as a modern-day explorer. Like those sailors, he too is pushing the bounds of what is humanly attainable. Not by circumnavigating the globe, but by circumventing death.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s odyssey involves ingesting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=User8_dkz9s\">111 pills</a> a day, eating his last (vegan) meal of the day at 11am, staying teetotal, doing an hour of exercise daily and going to bed at 8.30pm. But is it scientifically possible to slow our ageing like this? Or is his plan more likely to end up shipwrecked by reality?</p> <p>Living to even 100 is extremely difficult. In his recent book <em><a href=\"https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/nicklas-brendborg/jellyfish-age-backwards/9781529387926/\">Jellyfish Age Backwards</a></em>, the Danish molecular biologist Nicklas Brendborg estimated that it\u2019s as hard to survive from 93 to 100 as it is to make it from birth to 93. And most would consider 93 a decent innings. \u201cYour chance of being sick or dying increases exponentially with time,\u201d says Prof Richard Faragher from Brighton University. Plentiful evidence suggests that a healthy lifestyle <a href=\"https://www.epic-norfolk.org.uk/study-findings/#:~:text=number%20and%20size.-,Lifestyle,adopt%20none%20of%20these%20behaviours\">can add up to 14 years to our lives</a>. But given UK life expectancy is about 81, this isn\u2019t likely to make us centenarians. And <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00702-3\">a new study</a> shows that the rise in life expectancy is slowing down.</p>    <p>But if we adopt <em>extremely</em> healthy lifestyles, might we live <em>extremely</em> long lives? Not really. Extreme longevity is seemingly more genetically driven than normal ageing, meaning diet and exercise may only have a limited impact, says Lynne Cox, an Oxford University professor. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a panacea that\u2019s going to add 20 or 30 years to human life at the moment,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Take exercise \u2013 which clearly is good for us. One study of 55- to 79-year-old amateur cyclists <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12750\">found they were biologically young for their age</a>. In particular, their immune systems hadn\u2019t declined like their non-exercising peers. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should do ever more exercise. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10274991/\">Another recent study</a> on Finnish twins, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found moderate exercisers were biologically younger than those who did no exercise \u2013 and, strikingly, those who did a lot.</p> <p>\u201cYou really want to be in the sweet spot with exercise,\u201d says Cox. \u201cSuper fit athletes don\u2019t necessarily seem to be living any longer.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Skinny people don\u2019t seem to live the longest. Overweight people live longer than their underweight, normal and obese peers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As for diet, research shows that cutting calories can <a href=\"https://today.duke.edu/2014/06/wormlifespan\">double the lifespan of nematode worms</a>. Meanwhile, calorie-restricted mice can live about 30-40% longer, particularly <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0297\">if they do intermittent fasting</a>. Results in rhesus monkeys have been contradictory, but calorie-restricted monkeys appear healthier and <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/calorie-restriction-improves-health-survival-rhesus-monkeys#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20Wisconsin%20(UW,for%20such%20primates%20in%20captivity.\">may live</a> a couple of extra years. Johnson, who is restricting his calories by 10%, is hoping it will work for him, too. But the restrictions in the animal studies are large (a 30-40% reduction in calories) and humans aren\u2019t mice \u2013 or nematode worms.</p> <p>While a few studies <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9036399/\">show health benefits for humans,</a> it\u2019s difficult to verify that participants really maintained the restricted diets. Plus, says Cox, \u201cit\u2019s very, very hard to not become malnourished if you\u2019re cutting out 30% of your calories. It can actually be detrimental.\u201d This is particularly true if you\u2019re older, losing muscle mass, or restricting your calories indefinitely. Research shows older, calorie-restricted mice <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5565679/\">are at a higher risk of dying from infections</a>.</p> <p>Weight-loss jabs such as Ozempic are also popular among longevity enthusiasts \u2013 though Johnson says he hasn\u2019t tried it. New research shows they cut the risk of many age-related diseases, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01498-3/fulltext\">including cardiovascular diseases</a> and cancer, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce81j919gdjo\">leaving researchers optimistic</a> they could extend life. But we won\u2019t know their impact on lifespan for decades. They also come with potentially life-threatening side-effects, including pancreatitis. It\u2019s also worth noting that skinny people don\u2019t seem to live the longest. Strikingly, overweight people <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1555137\">live longer</a> than their underweight, normal and obese peers.</p>    <h2><strong>The mystery of centenarians</strong></h2> <p>Some people do enjoy very long lives. The world\u2019s \u201cblue zones\u201d (regions identified as having populations who live healthier and longer lives than others) \u2013 which include Sardinia in Italy, Okinawa in Japan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/ikaria-greece-longevity-secrets-age#:~:text=In%20Ikaria%2C%20a%20Greek%20island,number%20of%20other%20Greek%20islands.\">Ikaria in Greece</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thebluezonesstore.com/\">have spawned an industry</a> of lifestyle interventions, supplements and cookbooks. But a study by Saul Newman from University College London, which is now being peer reviewed, suggests much data on human centenarians is bogus.</p> <p>\u201cI tracked down 80% of the people in the world who were older than 110,\u201d says Newman, who found almost none of them had a birth certificate. \u201cIt\u2019s a statistical garbage pile.\u201d</p> <p>Alarm bells have been ringing for a while. In 2010, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11299646\">Japanese government review</a> discovered 230,000 of the country\u2019s centenarians were missing \u2013 presumably dead. And Newman says data suggests that some 72% of Greek centenarians are dead or missing, but their relatives haven\u2019t declared as much, possibly to keep collecting their pensions.</p> <p>Newman believes this is why blue zones appear in poor, rural areas, places where there\u2019s substandard record-keeping and pressure to commit pension fraud. In the UK, the relatively poor London borough of Tower Hamlets has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/28/supercentenarians-spurious-claims\">highest proportion of 105-year-olds</a> in the country, despite having a lower-than-average life expectancy overall. And longevity is linked to wealth \u2013 the countries in the world with the highest average life expectancy are rich ones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/07/morgan-levine-only-10-30-of-our-lifespan-is-estimated-to-be-due-to-genetics\">Morgan Levine: \u2018Only 10-30% of our lifespan is estimated to be due to genetics\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe old-age suicide rate in Okinawa is the fourth highest in Japan. They have twice the poverty rate of any other prefect. They\u2019re last in Japan for vegetable consumption,\u201d says Newman. \u201cIf you pretend that everything\u2019s great in Okinawa, you are leaving those people behind \u2013 you\u2019re exploiting them to sell cookbooks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d says Nir Barzilai, a longevity researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who has studied Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians in the US and their families. \u201cIt\u2019s a real problem.\u201d However, he argues records are fairly reliable in the US. And his team looks at many different documents, including passports, voting records and the ages of family members, to verify their centenarians.</p> <p>His own results do differ from those based on blue zones. Barzilai\u2019s centenarians <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21812767/\">didn\u2019t have very healthy lifestyles</a>, for example. \u201cHalf of them were overweight or obese, half of them were smoking, half of them weren\u2019t exercising, and very few were vegetarians,\u201d he says. But they were healthy \u2013 having only <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29050682/\">half the incidence of cardiovasular disease</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThey have genes that slow their ageing,\u201d explains Barzilai, who\u2019s working on identifying them. He\u2019s already discovered some 60% have genes that lower their levels of growth hormones in late life. This all suggests that genes, rather than lifestyle, are the secret to becoming a centenarian.</p> <h2><strong>Cellular ageing</strong></h2> <p>Not all species age like humans. Take ocean quahogs (a species of mollusc), rockfish and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/400-year-old-greenland-shark-is-the-oldest-vertebrate-animal\">Greenland sharks</a>, which don\u2019t have an exponentially increased death rate with age. \u201cOur knowledge of the mechanisms of ageing is incomplete,\u201d says Faragher.</p> <p>A key driver of ageing is a process called cell senescence. Cells enter this toxic state as we age, damaging tissue and generating inflammation and disease. But Cox and colleagues <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi4474\">have shown</a> that you can slow ageing if you manipulate these cells to behave as if they were younger. In 2009, a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08221\">hugely promising study</a> showed the drug rapamycin could make mice live up to 14% longer. A clinical trial on humans has even shown that when elderly people were given a low dose of a rapamycin-like drug for eight weeks, it <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29997249/\">boosted their immune system</a>, and led to a 50% reduction in infections for a year.</p> <p>Other promising, FDA-approved drugs that can extend the lifespan of animals and lead to greater health and reduced mortality in humans include diabetes medicines such as <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28802803/#:~:text=Diabetics%20taking%20metformin%20had%20significantly,HR=0.80,%2095%25CI\">metformin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947703/#:~:text=Canagliflozin%20showed%20significant%20benefit%20for%20all%E2%80%90cause%20mortality%20and%20hospitalization,and%20noncardiovascular%20death%20(P%20=%20.\">canagliflozin</a> and <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2796866#:~:text=Reductions%20in%20CV%20mortality%20with,symptomatic%20HF,%20regardless%20of%20LVEF.\">dapagliflozin</a>. Barzilai, however, stresses that these drugs have only been shown to work in people over 50. If you\u2019re young, or you combine several of these drugs, you may find they cause harm such as reduced muscle mass and testosterone. Similarly, rapamycin can \u201ctrigger diabetes, ulcers and prevent wound healing at high doses\u201d, says Cox.</p>    <p>Johnson, who takes rapamycin and metformin, acknowledges this. \u201cMetformin has so many effects on the body\u201d, he says. \u201cIt may have some kind of effect on muscle to some degree, but it may have a whole bunch of positive effects too.\u201d</p> <p>Another option is to deal with senescent cells by deleting them. Compounds found in many fruits and vegetables, including <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28416161/\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26711051/\">navitoclax</a>, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33242601/\">quercetin</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30279143/\">fisetin</a>, have shown promise in deleting such cells \u2013 and are now sold as supplements. Such drugs may also treat <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31542391/\">diabetic kidney disease</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30616998/\">idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</a> in humans, both caused in part by senescent cells.</p> <p>Faragher has also shown that resveratrol, found in grapes, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29041897/\">can reverse cell senescence</a>. But again, senescent cells do some good, too, such as healing wounds, which means it can be risky getting rid of them. We don\u2019t know for sure whether these drugs or supplements will actually help humans live considerably longer. But many longevity enthusiasts including Johnson are already taking them. Faragher, however, doesn\u2019t believe any of this will lead to an \u201cimmortality pill\u201d. Rather, these kinds of drugs could be \u201ca bit like antibiotics\u201d \u2013 taken during a limited time when you\u2019re ill or ahead of vaccination to enhance the immune system.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite promising research, a lack of human trials means there\u2019s still no proven way to live significantly past 100</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More experimental techniques exist, but may cause cancer. These include \u201cepigenetic reprogramming\u201d of cells to make them younger and gene therapies aimed at lengthening our telomeres \u2013 protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age. But while short telomeres are linked to a short lifespan, long telomeres boost cancer risk.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very hesitant about the telomerase stuff because of the cancer risk, though some newer studies suggest it\u2019s possible to minimise that risk,\u201d says Cox.</p> <p>So where does that leave us? Unfortunately, it appears to be a waiting game. Despite genuinely promising research, a lack of human trials means there\u2019s still no <em>proven</em> way to live significantly past 100. Researchers also warn against mixing and matching drugs and interventions the way Johnson does. \u201cEach one might buy a little bit of extra time. But if you put them all together, you might do worse rather than better,\u201d says Cox.</p> <p>But Johnson is optimistic. \u201cI\u2019ve arguably got the best biomarkers in the world,\u201d he says, adding that scientists, who \u201care spending 75% of their time writing grant proposals\u201d, should learn to value the open source data he provides \u2013 especially as other people are copying his protocol.</p> <p>Barzilai disagrees, stressing that one self-experimenting individual does not constitute a scientific study. \u201cIf Bryan Johnson dies, which I think is possible because he is doing a lot of crazy things together, it will reflect badly on us.\u201d</p>",

Not by circumnavigating the globe, but by circumventing death. Johnson\u2019s odyssey involves ingesting 111 pills a day, eating his last (vegan) meal of the day at 11am, staying teetotal, doing an hour of exercise daily and going to bed at 8.30pm.

Take exercise \u2013 which clearly is good for us. One study of 55- to 79-year-old amateur cyclists found they were biologically young for their age. In particular, their immune systems hadn\u2019t declined like their non-exercising peers. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should do ever more exercise. Another recent study on Finnish twins, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found moderate exercisers were biologically younger than those who did no exercise \u2013 and, strikingly, those who did a lot. \u201cYou really want to be in the sweet spot with exercise,\u201d says Cox. \u201cSuper fit athletes don\u2019t necessarily seem to be living any longer.\u201d As for diet, research shows that cutting calories can double the lifespan of nematode worms. Meanwhile, calorie-restricted mice can live about 30-40% longer, particularly if they do intermittent fasting. Results in rhesus monkeys have been contradictory, but calorie-restricted monkeys appear healthier and may live a couple of extra years. Johnson, who is restricting his calories by 10%, is hoping it will work for him, too. But the restrictions in the animal studies are large (a 30-40% reduction in calories) and humans aren\u2019t mice \u2013 or nematode worms. While a few studies show health benefits for humans, it\u2019s difficult to verify that participants really maintained the restricted diets. Plus, says Cox, \u201cit\u2019s very, very hard to not become malnourished if you\u2019re cutting out 30% of your calories. It can actually be detrimental.\u201d This is particularly true if you\u2019re older, losing muscle mass, or restricting your calories indefinitely. Research shows older, calorie-restricted mice are at a higher risk of dying from infections. Weight-loss jabs such as Ozempic are also popular among longevity enthusiasts \u2013 though Johnson says he hasn\u2019t tried it. New research shows they cut the risk of many age-related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer, leaving researchers optimistic they could extend life. But we won\u2019t know their impact on lifespan for decades. They also come with potentially life-threatening side-effects, including pancreatitis. It\u2019s also worth noting that skinny people don\u2019t seem to live the longest. Strikingly, overweight people live longer than their underweight, normal and obese peers. The mystery of centenarians Some people do enjoy very long lives. The world\u2019s \u201cblue zones\u201d (regions identified as having populations who live healthier and longer lives than others) \u2013 which include Sardinia in Italy, Okinawa in Japan and Ikaria in Greece \u2013 have spawned an industry of lifestyle interventions, supplements and cookbooks. But a study by Saul Newman from University College London, which is now being peer reviewed, suggests much data on human centenarians is bogus. \u201cI tracked down 80% of the people in the world who were older than 110,\u201d says Newman, who found almost none of them had a birth certificate. \u201cIt\u2019s a statistical garbage pile.\u201d Alarm bells have been ringing for a while. In 2010, a Japanese government review discovered 230,000 of the country\u2019s centenarians were missing \u2013 presumably dead. And Newman says data suggests that some 72% of Greek centenarians are dead or missing, but their relatives haven\u2019t declared as much, possibly to keep collecting their pensions. Newman believes this is why blue zones appear in poor, rural areas, places where there\u2019s substandard record-keeping and pressure to commit pension fraud. In the UK, the relatively poor London borough of Tower Hamlets has the highest proportion of 105-year-olds in the country, despite having a lower-than-average life expectancy overall. And longevity is linked to wealth \u2013 the countries in the world with the highest average life expectancy are rich ones. \u201cThe old-age suicide rate in Okinawa is the fourth highest in Japan. They have twice the poverty rate of any other prefect. They\u2019re last in Japan for vegetable consumption,\u201d says Newman. \u201cIf you pretend that everything\u2019s great in Okinawa, you are leaving those people behind \u2013 you\u2019re exploiting them to sell cookbooks.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d says Nir Barzilai, a longevity researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who has studied Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians in the US and their families. \u201cIt\u2019s a real problem.\u201d However, he argues records are fairly reliable in the US. And his team looks at many different documents, including passports, voting records and the ages of family members, to verify their centenarians. His own results do differ from those based on blue zones. Barzilai\u2019s centenarians didn\u2019t have very healthy lifestyles, for example. \u201cHalf of them were overweight or obese, half of them were smoking, half of them weren\u2019t exercising, and very few were vegetarians,\u201d he says. But they were healthy \u2013 having only half the incidence of cardiovasular disease. \u201cThey have genes that slow their ageing,\u201d explains Barzilai, who\u2019s working on identifying them. He\u2019s already discovered some 60% have genes that lower their levels of growth hormones in late life. This all suggests that genes, rather than lifestyle, are the secret to becoming a centenarian. Cellular ageing Not all species age like humans. Take ocean quahogs (a species of mollusc), rockfish and Greenland sharks, which don\u2019t have an exponentially increased death rate with age. \u201cOur knowledge of the mechanisms of ageing is incomplete,\u201d says Faragher. A key driver of ageing is a process called cell senescence. Cells enter this toxic state as we age, damaging tissue and generating inflammation and disease. But Cox and colleagues have shown that you can slow ageing if you manipulate these cells to behave as if they were younger. In 2009, a hugely promising study showed the drug rapamycin could make mice live up to 14% longer. A clinical trial on humans has even shown that when elderly people were given a low dose of a rapamycin-like drug for eight weeks, it boosted their immune system, and led to a 50% reduction in infections for a year. Other promising, FDA-approved drugs that can extend the lifespan of animals and lead to greater health and reduced mortality in humans include diabetes medicines such as metformin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. Barzilai, however, stresses that these drugs have only been shown to work in people over 50. If you\u2019re young, or you combine several of these drugs, you may find they cause harm such as reduced muscle mass and testosterone. Similarly, rapamycin can \u201ctrigger diabetes, ulcers and prevent wound healing at high doses\u201d, says Cox. Johnson, who takes rapamycin and metformin, acknowledges this. \u201cMetformin has so many effects on the body\u201d, he says. \u201cIt may have some kind of effect on muscle to some degree, but it may have a whole bunch of positive effects too.\u201d Another option is to deal with senescent cells by deleting them. Compounds found in many fruits and vegetables, including dasatinib, navitoclax, quercetin and fisetin, have shown promise in deleting such cells \u2013 and are now sold as supplements. Such drugs may also treat diabetic kidney disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in humans, both caused in part by senescent cells. Faragher has also shown that resveratrol, found in grapes, can reverse cell senescence. But again, senescent cells do some good, too, such as healing wounds, which means it can be risky getting rid of them. We don\u2019t know for sure whether these drugs or supplements will actually help humans live considerably longer. But many longevity enthusiasts including Johnson are already taking them. Faragher, however, doesn\u2019t believe any of this will lead to an \u201cimmortality pill\u201d. Rather, these kinds of drugs could be \u201ca bit like antibiotics\u201d \u2013 taken during a limited time when you\u2019re ill or ahead of vaccination to enhance the immune system. More experimental techniques exist, but may cause cancer. These include \u201cepigenetic reprogramming\u201d of cells to make them younger and gene therapies aimed at lengthening our telomeres \u2013 protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age. But while short telomeres are linked to a short lifespan, long telomeres boost cancer risk. \u201cI\u2019m very hesitant about the telomerase stuff because of the cancer risk, though some newer studies suggest it\u2019s possible to minimise that risk,\u201d says Cox. So where does that leave us? Unfortunately, it appears to be a waiting game. Despite genuinely promising research, a lack of human trials means there\u2019s still no proven way to live significantly past 100. Researchers also warn against mixing and matching drugs and interventions the way Johnson does. \u201cEach one might buy a little bit of extra time. But if you put them all together, you might do worse rather than better,\u201d says Cox. But Johnson is optimistic. \u201cI\u2019ve arguably got the best biomarkers in the world,\u201d he says, adding that scientists, who \u201care spending 75% of their time writing grant proposals\u201d, should learn to value the open source data he provides \u2013 especially as other people are copying his protocol. Barzilai disagrees, stressing that one self-experimenting individual does not constitute a scientific study. \u201cIf Bryan Johnson dies, which I think is possible because he is doing a lot of crazy things together, it will reflect badly on us.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was mostly in the small hours that I first read David Goodhart\u2019s new book on caring. By coincidence, it arrived as I was trying to look after my dying father at one end of the country and my own family at the other, while simultaneously attempting to work. Well, that\u2019s life: there are millions of us in the same boat, which is why a deeper exploration of care feels so very overdue. But perhaps it hasn\u2019t been Goodhart\u2019s life, exactly. When it came to his own four children and elderly parents, he confesses, like many men of his generation he \u201cplayed a subordinate role\u201d to his now ex-wife and his sisters respectively. As a man tackling this topic now, he writes, he\u2019s braced for some flak. Well, yes; and perhaps particularly as the kind of man who writes that while the early days of lockdown might have been tough on women, \u201cthe story in the UK was also one of people finding domestic life unexpectedly rewarding\u201d, which may not be exactly how parents of stir-crazed toddlers remember it. But anyway, back to the book.</p> <p>This is the third in a trilogy that began in 2017 with the thought-provoking <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/27/road-somewhere-populist-revolt-future-politics-review-britain-divided-brexit-david-goodhart\">The Road to Somewhere</a></em>, which immortalised the two warring tribes of Brexit as Everywheres (liberal, cosmopolitan, faintly haughty urban elites) v Somewheres (socially conservative, anchored in provincial towns, annoyed at being condescended to). This time his focus is family life and fertility, a hot topic for British Tories obsessed with the idea that millennials aren\u2019t having enough babies, but also for Trump-era Republicans and the European far right.</p> <p>Goodhart\u2019s case is the Somewhere-ish one that feminism may have been great for liberating women and boosting economic growth, but that it was less positive for children supposedly damaged by divorce, mothers who\u2019d rather have been at home, and countries whose populations are now shrinking thanks to millennials\u2019 apparent reluctance to settle down and breed. Though there\u2019s an inevitable section titled \u201cWhat about men?\u201d, he insists the real modern battleground isn\u2019t feminists v disgruntled men who want them back in the kitchen. Instead, it\u2019s \u201ccare egalitarians\u201d (who see men\u2019s and women\u2019s roles as interchangeable, and think putting young babies in nursery is self-evidently good) v \u201ccare balancers\u201d, who embrace equality but worry about the consequences of what he calls \u201can unstable family life\u201d. Neither of these archetypes seems wholly convincing in real life, perhaps because parenting is a muddy business that doesn\u2019t lend itself to such starkly drawn binaries as Brexit. But from here, things take a significantly wilder turn.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Is it too far-fetched, he muses, to think a rise in the number of people on sickness benefit is somehow connected to falling numbers of full-time parents?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Goodhart suggests the current teenage mental health crisis may be related to rising divorce rates, while conceding that the timings don\u2019t really fit (given the big shift in divorce rates started in the 1980s). Well, maybe it has something to do with daycare used by working parents, then? Leaping on the US psychologist Jonathan Haidt\u2019s thesis that overprotective parenting has made children too anxious, he suggests that perhaps this kind of coddling starts in nursery rather than at home, if busy staff conscious of being responsible for other people\u2019s precious children become too health and safety conscious. (The sole evidence offered here is one article by a journalist, arguing that she let her toddler take more physical risks than the nursery did.) Is it too far-fetched, he muses at one point, to think a rise in the number of people on long-term sickness benefit is somehow connected to falling numbers of full-time parents? Given he presents no hard evidence actually linking the two, then, yes, it absolutely is a leap too far.</p> <p>Goodhart returns to firmer ground in the final chapters, arguing that caring should be more highly valued regardless of who does it and offering plenty of practical suggestions, from flexible working practices or free respite care for family carers to more generous paternity leave, and higher wages for social care workers \u2013 though, for him, the latter seems partly to be about reducing reliance on cheap immigrant labour.</p> <p>He\u2019s right, too, that there is an identifiable group of parents who long to spend more time with their children, feel wretched about not doing so, but don\u2019t have the luxury of that choice (though they include fathers as well as mothers). Mainstream political parties tend to offer this often low-earning group cheaper childcare, so that they can work even longer hours, and Goodhart has a point that their voices aren\u2019t much heard: it would be genuinely interesting to hear more from them about what they really want from politicians. But there are no such in-depth interviews here.

      "bodyText": "It was mostly in the small hours that I first read David Goodhart\u2019s new book on caring. By coincidence, it arrived as I was trying to look after my dying father at one end of the country and my own family at the other, while simultaneously attempting to work. Well, that\u2019s life: there are millions of us in the same boat, which is why a deeper exploration of care feels so very overdue. But perhaps it hasn\u2019t been Goodhart\u2019s life, exactly. When it came to his own four children and elderly parents, he confesses, like many men of his generation he \u201cplayed a subordinate role\u201d to his now ex-wife and his sisters respectively. As a man tackling this topic now, he writes, he\u2019s braced for some flak. Well, yes; and perhaps particularly as the kind of man who writes that while the early days of lockdown might have been tough on women, \u201cthe story in the UK was also one of people finding domestic life unexpectedly rewarding\u201d, which may not be exactly how parents of stir-crazed toddlers remember it. But anyway, back to the book. This is the third in a trilogy that began in 2017 with the thought-provoking The Road to Somewhere, which immortalised the two warring tribes of Brexit as Everywheres (liberal, cosmopolitan, faintly haughty urban elites) v Somewheres (socially conservative, anchored in provincial towns, annoyed at being condescended to). This time his focus is family life and fertility, a hot topic for British Tories obsessed with the idea that millennials aren\u2019t having enough babies, but also for Trump-era Republicans and the European far right. Goodhart\u2019s case is the Somewhere-ish one that feminism may have been great for liberating women and boosting economic growth, but that it was less positive for children supposedly damaged by divorce, mothers who\u2019d rather have been at home, and countries whose populations are now shrinking thanks to millennials\u2019 apparent reluctance to settle down and breed. Though there\u2019s an inevitable section titled \u201cWhat about men?\u201d, he insists the real modern battleground isn\u2019t feminists v disgruntled men who want them back in the kitchen. Instead, it\u2019s \u201ccare egalitarians\u201d (who see men\u2019s and women\u2019s roles as interchangeable, and think putting young babies in nursery is self-evidently good) v \u201ccare balancers\u201d, who embrace equality but worry about the consequences of what he calls \u201can unstable family life\u201d. Neither of these archetypes seems wholly convincing in real life, perhaps because parenting is a muddy business that doesn\u2019t lend itself to such starkly drawn binaries as Brexit. But from here, things take a significantly wilder turn. Goodhart suggests the current teenage mental health crisis may be related to rising divorce rates, while conceding that the timings don\u2019t really fit (given the big shift in divorce rates started in the 1980s). Well, maybe it has something to do with daycare used by working parents, then? Leaping on the US psychologist Jonathan Haidt\u2019s thesis that overprotective parenting has made children too anxious, he suggests that perhaps this kind of coddling starts in nursery rather than at home, if busy staff conscious of being responsible for other people\u2019s precious children become too health and safety conscious. (The sole evidence offered here is one article by a journalist, arguing that she let her toddler take more physical risks than the nursery did.) Is it too far-fetched, he muses at one point, to think a rise in the number of people on long-term sickness benefit is somehow connected to falling numbers of full-time parents? Given he presents no hard evidence actually linking the two, then, yes, it absolutely is a leap too far. Goodhart returns to firmer ground in the final chapters, arguing that caring should be more highly valued regardless of who does it and offering plenty of practical suggestions, from flexible working practices or free respite care for family carers to more generous paternity leave, and higher wages for social care workers \u2013 though, for him, the latter seems partly to be about reducing reliance on cheap immigrant labour. He\u2019s right, too, that there is an identifiable group of parents who long to spend more time with their children, feel wretched about not doing so, but don\u2019t have the luxury of that choice (though they include fathers as well as mothers). Mainstream political parties tend to offer this often low-earning group cheaper childcare, so that they can work even longer hours, and Goodhart has a point that their voices aren\u2019t much heard: it would be genuinely interesting to hear more from them about what they really want from politicians. But there are no such in-depth interviews here. Instead, the author dusts off two ideas \u2013 giving the money spent on subsidising nursery places directly to parents to use as they wish, and a tax break for single breadwinner couples that wouldn\u2019t come close to making up for a stay-at-home parent\u2019s missing salary \u2013 that were mainstays of Conservative leadership contests more than two decades ago, in what was socially and economically a very different world. In fairness to Goodhart, care is a fiendishly difficult policy nut to crack, and nobody has all the answers. But what this book lacks, ironically given its subject, is intimacy; that deep, gut understanding of what it\u2019s really like in 2024 to look after someone who needs you.

My father was a captain in the Royal Navy, so any hymns about the sea I would play loud \u2013 up until the day that I got fired. Fired for what? I was 16, eating Refreshers, larking around with my friend who was sitting with me under the pretext of being my page turner. I dropped a sweet between the keys and the resounding oomph of the bass wouldn\u2019t stop. I was excommunicated. Sundays now? I don\u2019t take my children to church. We\u2019re fallen Catholics. My week is full throttle \u2013 one daughter is at music college, the other plays netball and my son plays football. Sundays I try to make a day of rest. Sunday grub? We always have an open door. Everybody shows up with their families from many different cultures, which I adore. We\u2019ll have a massive roast or a barbecue. My partner does the cooking. If he didn\u2019t, we\u2019d all starve. Are you a bad cook? I don\u2019t understand the alchemy. This upsets every Filipino auntie. Rice, however\u2013 like any good Asian girl, I\u2019m an expert. I didn\u2019t want the job of cooking the rice in the jungle in I\u2019m a Celeb, but no one else could. Sunday evening? I make sure my children have a little bit of me because they\u2019ve got such different needs. I\u2019ll do a box set with my middle daughter, like Stranger Things. I met Millie Bobby Brown on holiday before I\u2019d watched it and though she knew me from the jungle, I had no idea who she was!

About 2,700 people fleeing conflict in Lebanon have now landed in Australia, as the federal government prepares to start ending flights. A year on from Hamas\u2019 7 October attack on Israel, fighting has widened in the region from Gaza to Lebanon, Yemen and Iran. Vice president Harris said her administration was working to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. Asked on Sunday about the Coalition\u2019s position on a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, Paterson said it could only happen when Hezbollah had been \u201cdegraded and defeated\u201d. This is at odds with Biden and Harris, who have called for a de-escalation and ceasefire. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email When questioned about being in disagreement with the nation\u2019s closest ally, Paterson told Insiders: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be remarkable for an Australian politician to disagree with an American politician, particularly the United States administration under President Biden and Vice President Harris, a centre-left administration.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m from a centre-right political party, there\u2019ll be times that we disagree, and mature adults can be open and honest,\u201d Paterson said.

More than 1,200 Israelis were killed when Hamas launched its attack last year, taking hundreds more hostage. Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began its retaliatory strikes, with the majority of Gaza\u2019s population facing displacement and starvation. Interest in free seats out of Beirut has declined sharply in recent days, with fewer than 180 aboard two flights to Cyprus that departed on Friday. The last two government-chartered flights will leave Beirut on Sunday before the Australian government pulls the pin on the evacuation operation. Australians and their family members still in Lebanon will need to resort to local carrier Middle East Airlines or other commercial airlines. One final Qantas flight is due to leave Cyprus on Wednesday evening. The flights followed an escalation in Israel\u2019s year-long scuffle with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in recent weeks, with a campaign of intense bombings across Lebanon including its capital Beirut. More than 2,200 people have been killed and another 1.2 million have been displaced across a nation about the size of Sydney.",

Vice-president Kamala Harris meanwhile helped pack diapers, bandages and pain relief pills among other items into care packages for victims of Hurricane Helene as she visited the swing state of North Carolina, which narrowly backed Trump in 2020. \u201cYou\u2019re exactly right,\u201d she said to Greg Hatem, owner of The Pit Authentic Barbecue restaurant where the aid event was taking place, as he commented that \u201cit takes a village\u201d. Harris also met with Black leaders at the restaurant. It was her second trip to North Carolina since Helene tore through the state last month. Here\u2019s what else happened on Saturday: Kamala Harris on Saturday released a report on her health and medical history, which found that \u201cshe possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency\u201d if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president\u2019s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions about Donald Trump\u2019s physical fitness and mental acuity. Tightening poll figures triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase. Amid a dramatic news cycle that has seen the US hit by two destructive hurricanes and rising fears of all-out war in the Middle East, the Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker showed the vice-president and Democratic nominee with a two-point nationwide lead, 48% to 46%, over her Republican opponent as of 10 October \u2013 tellingly, down from a 4% advantage she registered two weeks ago. The far-right website the Gateway Pundit acknowledged for the first time on Saturday that there had not been any fraud during ballot counting in Atlanta in 2020 when Donald Trump lost the presidency. It was a significant concession from one of the most influential conservative sites that plays a key role in spreading election misinformation. Tens of thousands of Christians poured on to the National Mall on Saturday in a pre-election event aimed at rescuing America from secularism. The rally was a collaboration organized by multiple far-right Christian leaders affiliated with the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement on the political far right that seeks to establish long-term Christian dominion over government and society as well as get Trump a second presidency in November.",

The expectation in Whitehall is that Reeves will move to raise many billions by hiking employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, after Starmer refused to rule this out at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday. Challenged by Rishi Sunak, Starmer swerved: \u201cWe made an absolute commitment in relation to not raising tax on working people,\u201d he said, not saying if Reeves could sting employers instead.

This is unlikely, with most of the discussion expected to focus on methods by which developed nations can pay poorer countries to transition away from fossil fuels and adapt to climate change\u2019s worst impacts.

This means developing ways to extract carbon emissions at factories and power plants and then to sequester them. This is carbon capture and storage (CCS), a process that recently received a major boost in the UK when the energy secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/04/labour-to-commit-almost-22bn-to-fund-carbon-capture-and-storage-projects\">Ed Miliband, announced a \u00a322bn investment in CCS schemes</a> that would eventually lead to 8.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year being removed from emissions from British industrial plants.</p> <p>It should be noted that the UK emitted 384m tonnes of carbon dioxide last year, so the scheme will clearly make little difference to our overall contribution to global warming. However, it should, if successful, highlight a route for tackling the crisis by providing us with an additional weapon in the fight against global warming alongside renewable energy, electric cars and home insulation.

Why should public money be spent on cleaning up emissions created by the fossil fuels that make private companies so much money, for example?</p> <p>Crucially, we are failing to halt global warming. We are not going to stop carbon in the atmosphere reaching dangerous levels quickly enough and so will need to find ways to remove it once it has got there.

      "body": "<p>Scores of Labour MPs are pleading with Rachel Reeves to embrace spending tens of billions more on ailing public services as part of an increasingly wide-ranging budget that could raise tax on employers and the wealthy.</p> <p>In a huge gamble that comes after a rocky first 100 days in office and a Downing Street reset, the chancellor is closely examining an increase in employer national insurance contributions that could significantly fill a black hole in public spending.</p> <p>With Labour MPs desperate for the government to show that the new administration can make a tangible difference to the country before the next election, a group of about 70 supportive Labour MPs have now written to Reeves urging her to commit to a major <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/10/will-rachel-reevess-rules-on-debt-and-spending-survive-the-budget\">rewriting of fiscal rules</a> that would allow tens of billions to be poured into schools, hospitals, transport links and other crucial infrastructure.</p> <p>The letter from the Labour Growth Group, seen by the <em>Observer</em>, warns Reeves that Labour must not repeat the mistakes of the previous Tory governments by ducking the \u201ctough choices required to unlock investment\u201d and encourage growth.</p> <p>The group wants Reeves to follow through with a change that would see the value of new assets built with investment reflected in the calculation of Britain\u2019s debt. The move could unlock as much as \u00a350bn, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, though the figure allocated by the chancellor is likely to be markedly less than that.</p> <p>\u201cWe give voice to the silent majority who benefit from economic reforms, infrastructure projects and growth, no matter how well organised the vocal minority,\u201d writes the group, which includes influential MPs such as Josh Simons, the former head of the Labour Together thinktank, Torsten Bell, the former chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, and Chi Onwurah, the Labour chair of the science, innovation and technology committee.</p> <p>\u201cIt is time to value these assets properly in our fiscal framework \u2026 Time is of the essence \u2013 the sooner we invest, the sooner our constituents will begin to benefit from that investment in their communities.</p>    <p>\u201cIf we delay, we risk further entrenching the barriers to growth that have held our country back for too long. We say this upcoming budget is the time to grasp the opportunity before us and act with conviction.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/13/tax-wealth-and-value-public-assets-how-reeves-can-solve-her-biggest-budget-challenges\">Tax wealth and value public assets: how Reeves can solve her biggest budget challenges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the letter from the group is a show of support from loyalists, it also reflects fears among some in Labour\u2019s ranks that Reeves may opt for a less ambitious change such as excluding Bank of England losses from debt calculations, freeing up between \u00a310bn and \u00a320bn.

      "bodyText": "Scores of Labour MPs are pleading with Rachel Reeves to embrace spending tens of billions more on ailing public services as part of an increasingly wide-ranging budget that could raise tax on employers and the wealthy. In a huge gamble that comes after a rocky first 100 days in office and a Downing Street reset, the chancellor is closely examining an increase in employer national insurance contributions that could significantly fill a black hole in public spending. With Labour MPs desperate for the government to show that the new administration can make a tangible difference to the country before the next election, a group of about 70 supportive Labour MPs have now written to Reeves urging her to commit to a major rewriting of fiscal rules that would allow tens of billions to be poured into schools, hospitals, transport links and other crucial infrastructure. The letter from the Labour Growth Group, seen by the Observer, warns Reeves that Labour must not repeat the mistakes of the previous Tory governments by ducking the \u201ctough choices required to unlock investment\u201d and encourage growth. The group wants Reeves to follow through with a change that would see the value of new assets built with investment reflected in the calculation of Britain\u2019s debt. The move could unlock as much as \u00a350bn, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, though the figure allocated by the chancellor is likely to be markedly less than that. \u201cWe give voice to the silent majority who benefit from economic reforms, infrastructure projects and growth, no matter how well organised the vocal minority,\u201d writes the group, which includes influential MPs such as Josh Simons, the former head of the Labour Together thinktank, Torsten Bell, the former chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, and Chi Onwurah, the Labour chair of the science, innovation and technology committee. \u201cIt is time to value these assets properly in our fiscal framework \u2026 Time is of the essence \u2013 the sooner we invest, the sooner our constituents will begin to benefit from that investment in their communities. \u201cIf we delay, we risk further entrenching the barriers to growth that have held our country back for too long. We say this upcoming budget is the time to grasp the opportunity before us and act with conviction.\u201d While the letter from the group is a show of support from loyalists, it also reflects fears among some in Labour\u2019s ranks that Reeves may opt for a less ambitious change such as excluding Bank of England losses from debt calculations, freeing up between \u00a310bn and \u00a320bn. MPs also want immediate action on investment that will deliver tangible benefits by the next election. While some in Whitehall are concerned about frightening the markets with extra borrowing, figures close to the chancellor say that there is plenty of scope for a change and that the new rules would provide for a far more sensible amount of fiscal \u201cheadroom\u201d that would help the government plan for the longer term. Lucy Rigby, co-chair of the Labour Growth Group, said the government needed to \u201cbreak the Tory doom loop of low investment, low productivity and low growth if we\u2019re going to deliver the change our constituents want to see\u201d in their communities. \u201cThere is no time to waste and that\u2019s why we\u2019re encouraging the chancellor today to be bold and ambitious in investing for growth in the coming budget,\u201d she said. Simons warned that the government\u2019s fiscal framework had already become an \u201cobject of derision\u201d among some economists. \u201cIt\u2019s time we listen to them, to businesses and to investors, and make the government a serious partner for investment again,\u201d he said. Onwurah added: \u201cAfter 14 years of Tory economic stagnation, economic growth is rightly the priority for this government \u2013 economic growth founded on a virtuous cycle of investment, innovation, productivity, good jobs and rising incomes \u2013 and that is the path toward a prosperous future that my constituents deserve, and which will put us in the forefront of the industries of the future.\u201d Reeves appears to be already committed to a rewriting of fiscal rules, though the final details of the budget have yet to be finalised. In what would amount to more of a political gamble, she is considering the increase to employer national insurance. That measure \u2013 either an increase to contributions or applying employer national insurance to pension contributions \u2013 could raise tens of billions, but will be labelled a \u201cjobs tax\u201d by the Conservatives.",

They echo still today</a>\u201d). These are real deaths and real children and real loss. The blood libel myth is a horrific example of how antisemitic propaganda was used to persecute, and eventually exile, the Jewish population of England. It is a shameful facet of British history but it is, and it is important that we strip its power by firmly establishing this, a myth. The killing and bombing and starving of Gaza children is not a myth. It is fact, it is continuing and it is irrevocably disrespectful to their memory and their families to suggest that their bodies are only a prop in an antisemitic narrative.</p> <p>What is antisemitic is to equate an entire religion with one violent regime and occupier, which is precisely what Jacobson does in this article. The Jewish population and faith is diverse and there are many who do not support the Gazan occupation and genocide.<br><strong>Esther Chauncy</strong><br>London E7<br></p> <p>As a writer of fiction, Howard Jacobson is an excellent polemicist who in his article gives cover for Israel\u2019s war crimes against my people, and so risks stoking antisemitism. I will never defend antisemitic blood libel, although I will accuse Israel of habitually murdering Palestinian children.</p> <p>Here are some facts: <em>Guardian</em> reporter Chris McGreal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/02/gaza-palestinian-children-killed-idf-israel-war\">wrote in April</a> that doctors were \u201cdeeply troubled by the number of children who were severely wounded or killed by single gunshots\u201d from Israeli sniping. A group of 45 doctors sent a letter with accompanying documentary evidence attesting to this. My mother\u2019s cousin, 15-year-old Abdallah El-Farra, was shot like this while fetching bread for his family in July.</p> <p>Also in April, the <em>Guardian</em> reported that Israel knowingly allows the killing of civilians with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes\">AI-powered targeting methodology</a>. In Nasser hospital, in November 2023, I watched as a grim procession consisting of a baby, three older children and two adults were carried to the morgue immediately after an Israeli airstrike on the Khan Younis refugee camp. Twenty-five of my maternal family, including children, were killed by an Israeli airstrike on their home in Khan Younis last week.</p> <p>We accuse Israelis and their western arms dealers, not Jews, of murdering more children than in any other conflict in the past two decades. Jacobson should pause to consider facts and the impact of conflating Jewishness with Israel if he truly cares about antisemitism.<br><strong>Mohamed Ghalaieny</strong><br>Manchester<br></p> <h2 data-note-id=\"7dec3303-eb9f-4a06-bfd4-73e132173b09\" data-type=\"subhead\">I\u2019m positively charged</h2> <p>Ros Coward is right to ask for a more coherent and effective system of public EV charging (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/four-years-after-buying-an-electric-car-why-am-i-still-forced-to-play-hunt-the-charger\">Four years after buying an electric car, why am I still forced to play hunt-the-charger?</a>\u201d). </p> <p>Nonetheless, my 18 months of EV ownership has left me feeling much more positive.

At best, about a third of the energy in the fuel is used to propel the car \u2013 two-thirds is discarded as heat from the radiator and exhaust. Hybrids are better than conventional cars, but only marginally. Driven sensibly, our mid-sized EV has a range between 280 (winter) and 320 (summer) miles. It has taken us to west Wales and to south-west France.

      "bodyText": "\u201cTales of infanticide\u201d is not what is happening in Gaza (\u201cTales of infanticide have stoked hatred of Jews for centuries. They echo still today\u201d). These are real deaths and real children and real loss. The blood libel myth is a horrific example of how antisemitic propaganda was used to persecute, and eventually exile, the Jewish population of England. It is a shameful facet of British history but it is, and it is important that we strip its power by firmly establishing this, a myth. The killing and bombing and starving of Gaza children is not a myth. It is fact, it is continuing and it is irrevocably disrespectful to their memory and their families to suggest that their bodies are only a prop in an antisemitic narrative. What is antisemitic is to equate an entire religion with one violent regime and occupier, which is precisely what Jacobson does in this article. The Jewish population and faith is diverse and there are many who do not support the Gazan occupation and genocide. Esther Chauncy London E7 As a writer of fiction, Howard Jacobson is an excellent polemicist who in his article gives cover for Israel\u2019s war crimes against my people, and so risks stoking antisemitism. I will never defend antisemitic blood libel, although I will accuse Israel of habitually murdering Palestinian children. Here are some facts: Guardian reporter Chris McGreal wrote in April that doctors were \u201cdeeply troubled by the number of children who were severely wounded or killed by single gunshots\u201d from Israeli sniping. A group of 45 doctors sent a letter with accompanying documentary evidence attesting to this. My mother\u2019s cousin, 15-year-old Abdallah El-Farra, was shot like this while fetching bread for his family in July. Also in April, the Guardian reported that Israel knowingly allows the killing of civilians with its AI-powered targeting methodology. In Nasser hospital, in November 2023, I watched as a grim procession consisting of a baby, three older children and two adults were carried to the morgue immediately after an Israeli airstrike on the Khan Younis refugee camp. Twenty-five of my maternal family, including children, were killed by an Israeli airstrike on their home in Khan Younis last week. We accuse Israelis and their western arms dealers, not Jews, of murdering more children than in any other conflict in the past two decades. Jacobson should pause to consider facts and the impact of conflating Jewishness with Israel if he truly cares about antisemitism. Mohamed Ghalaieny Manchester I\u2019m positively charged Ros Coward is right to ask for a more coherent and effective system of public EV charging (\u201cFour years after buying an electric car, why am I still forced to play hunt-the-charger?\u201d). Nonetheless, my 18 months of EV ownership has left me feeling much more positive. For those of us able to charge at home it is a no-brainer. Aside from the heavy carbon footprint, internal combustion engines are woefully inefficient in energy use. At best, about a third of the energy in the fuel is used to propel the car \u2013 two-thirds is discarded as heat from the radiator and exhaust. Hybrids are better than conventional cars, but only marginally. Driven sensibly, our mid-sized EV has a range between 280 (winter) and 320 (summer) miles. It has taken us to west Wales and to south-west France. Long trips require a little forethought, but so does anything in life that is to be done effectively. \u201cRange anxiety\u201d feels suspiciously like a neurosis that is being promoted by lobbyists for the oil industry. Dr John Gee Forest Row, East Sussex Looking good, feeling good At last, someone with common sense who realises that the reason people get surgery is simply to feel better about themselves (\u201cSocial media isn\u2019t driving the plastic surgery boom. Who doesn\u2019t want to look better?\u201d). I wish the sour grapes crowd would stop shaming those who simply want to feel better about themselves, instead of insinuating that anyone who cares about how they look is somehow a bad person. Bekah Griffiths Cobham, Surrey What about the climate? Will Hutton always has something important to say about politics and society. His new book is no different. But there is a flaw at its heart and he illustrates that in his piece (\u201cAfter 100 days of mistakes, we need to hear Labour\u2019s underlying philosophy\u201d). The world has changed and yet here we are again, 70 years back, picking the brains of a long-dead politician. The challenges we face are unprecedented and the elephant in the room is the climate and biodiversity crisis. No mention of that here and hardly any in his book, yet the looming failure to address it will negate all his vision. His plea to the new government is valid and heartfelt but the gap between that and the action we need, now, is a yawning chasm. Neil Blackshaw Alnwick, Northumberland Hard work pays off Torsten Bell rightly highlights the role that inherited wealth plays in financial security, but strays too far into defeatism (\u201cTikTok is full of advice on how to retire early. The truth is you just need rich parents\u201d). Reducing success to luck of birth ignores the value of hard work, innovation and perseverance. Suggesting that financial success is unattainable without rich parents risks fostering resignation in young people. Yes, inherited wealth creates advantages, but it doesn\u2019t make ambition and effort futile. Social mobility stagnates when we promote a sense of helplessness. Instead, we should empower young people to believe that, despite the challenges, they can change their circumstances. While the system is rigged towards the wealthy, there are countless examples of people who have built success through smart choices and persistence. It may be harder today, but it\u2019s not impossible. The state has a role in levelling the playing field, but individuals must take charge of their own destiny. Omar Sarhan Leeds Put a brake on boozing Re \u201cEngland urged to bring in minimum unit price on alcohol as deaths rise 10% a year\u201d: prevention takes many forms in public health. The people who design seatbelts do not generally want to outlaw cars, but to reduce the deaths from crashes. Some people will drink a lot of alcohol, if it is readily available and relatively cheap. Damage to the body from alcohol relates to the amount consumed and how frequently. Alcohol-related deaths are at a high-water mark \u2013 and still rising. Our society does not encourage driving a car without brakes. A minimum unit price is effective, for some drinkers, in putting a brake on their boozing. Woody Caan Duxford, Cambridgeshire Portobello porkies In his review of Boris Johnson\u2019s Unleashed, Tim Adams asks us to spare a thought for the factcheckers (New Review). He cites Johnson\u2019s claims that \u201cgraffiti appeared on the wall in Portobello Road\u201d, saying \u201cBrexit saves lives\u201d. As a resident of the road, I can confirm that is a fact. I can also confirm that beneath it, in the same handwriting, were the words \u201cBrexit keeps Britain white\u201d. I painted over it. That may be why Johnson failed to mention it in his memoir.

Simply put, with some of the more captivating early-round playoff baseball we\u2019ve seen in some time. And the drama has been much welcome after last year\u2019s early rounds included no fewer than six series sweeps, with series winners trouncing losers by 20 games to two, leaving all but the most hardcore baseball fans pining for preseason NBA games.</p> <p>One year later the situation has changed significantly: buoyed up by strong storylines, competitive games and a flurry of dramatic finishes, baseball has mojo and momentum as it heads deeper into October. Television ratings <a href=\"https://frontofficesports.com/newsletter/mlb-ratings-are-soaring/\">have surged by 41%</a> year-on-year, and viewership is up even when taking on college and NFL football. So what\u2019s driving the October uptick?</p> <h2>Overcoming expectations</h2> <p>It\u2019s one of the best storylines in baseball: a team with low (or no) expectations sneaking into the postseason and making their presence felt. This year\u2019s playoffs are loaded with such breakout clubs.</p> <p>The Padres lost star closer Josh Hader and Cy Young winner Blake Snell to free agency and also dealt soon-to-be-free-agent mega-slugger Juan Soto to the Yankees. The expectation? Third or fourth place. Instead, the Friars won 93 games and the Soto deal, bringing in their best starter, Michael King, in return for a player who was never going to re-sign in San Diego.</p> <p>Guardian writers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/28/mlb-2024-predictions-will-the-braves-machine-outdo-the-dodgers-stars\">awarded the Minnesota Twins another divisional title</a> in March, but it was Cleveland who had the best record in baseball at several points during the year, racing out to a 51-26 start that nobody saw coming. Not expected to contend, the Guardians were led by Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez, still the best player nobody talks about, and Emanuel Clase, the most dominant closer in baseball.</p> <p>The Tigers were sellers at the deadline, dealing away multiple veterans including pitcher Jack Flaherty to the Dodgers. Then they started winning, moving from nine games under .500 on 4 July into the playoffs, finishing with a 47-28 stretch backed by southpaw Cy Young candidate Tarik Skubal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/04/shohei-ohtani-teammates-normal-humble-dodgers-star\">Shohei Ohtani: how the LA Dodgers\u2019 humble, normcore megastar reached baseball\u2019s biggest stage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Royals had the greatest turnaround in baseball, rebounding from a 106-loss season to 86 wins and a wildcard berth. That\u2019s mostly thanks to a rotation as good as any in the AL led by Seth Lugo and Cole Ragans, while Bobby Witt Jr put in a MVP-caliber season.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the Mets, in a self-proclaimed \u201ctransition season\u201d, who were 11 games under .500 in late May and facing a long summer of empty seats and roster rejigging. Thanks to a <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/phillies/mets-omg-sign-song-grimace-first-pitch-win-record-20241004.html\">McDonald\u2019s mascot</a>, the emergence of Francisco Lindor, a surprising pitching rotation and a resurgent lineup, the team streaked to the best record in baseball from June onwards, earning a playoff spot during a makeup doubleheader a day after the regular season ended.</p> <p>Throw in the Dodgers, Yankees, Phillies, Brewers and Astros, and we entered these playoffs with an eclectic mix of haves and have-nots battling it out.</p> <h2>Star wattage</h2> <p>They\u2019re out, finally. Aaron Judge, who missed out on the 2023 postseason, returned to the playoffs after another Mickey Mantle-esqye season in center field for the Yankees. Even when he\u2019s invisible, as he was in the Yankees\u2019 ALDS win over Kansas City, every at-bat is a must-see. Will he finally break out of the .620 OPS slump against Cleveland in the ALCS?</p> <p>Across town, Lindor emerged as a team leader and bona fide megastar following an MVP-like season. After a <a href=\"https://x.com/SNYtv/status/1840842948864335949/video/1\">historic blast that sent New York into the playoffs</a>, he topped it with a grand slam that sunk Philly in Game 4, propelling New York into the NLCS. There was a time not long ago Mets fans thought Cleveland may have won the trade that brought Lindor to New York. Now he\u2019s one of MLB\u2019s most prized assets.</p>    <p>Soon-to-be-AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal propelled the Tigers past the heavily favored Astros, and to the brink of an ALCS appearance before bowing out against the Guardians. Young Skubal has only just begun, and if he can stay healthy, will emerge as a true MLB superstar.</p> <p>And of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/04/shohei-ohtani-teammates-normal-humble-dodgers-star\">there\u2019s Shohei Ohtani</a>, by far baseball\u2019s most recognizable face, who played for years on a stage with a low ceiling in Anaheim. Now he\u2019s finally in the playoffs, and should be for sometime on the deep-pocketed Dodgers. Could he become the first MLB player since Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter to transcend the sport in the US? A big-market matchup with the Mets in the NLCS should help.</p> <h2>Unforgettable moments</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to find magical moments in any non-competitive series, but each of this year\u2019s four divisional series started out with 1-1 deadlocks with two of them going the five-game distance. That said, it was the wildcard round that provided the most theatrical moment of the season.</p> <p>Soon-to-be-free agent slugger Pete Alonso, who most Mets fans would have been happy to let go of after an underwhelming regular season, struck what is arguably the most dramatic home run in franchise history in the decisive Game 3 at Milwaukee. His top-of-the-ninth, three-run dinger instantly cemented his place in Mets lore in what has to be one of the most instantaneous 180-degree swings experienced by even the most fickle of fanbases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewHarts/status/1842019581726015701\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Howie Rose-Pete Alonso home run call is as amazing as you think it would be <a href=\"https://t.co/OHw180oMDK\">pic.twitter.com/OHw180oMDK</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Harts (@AndrewHarts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewHarts/status/1842019581726015701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>The Guardians were seeking a 2-0 ALDS lead over the Tigers in what had been a tense, drama-filled scoreless match-up.

Third or fourth place. Instead, the Friars won 93 games and the Soto deal, bringing in their best starter, Michael King, in return for a player who was never going to re-sign in San Diego. Guardian writers awarded the Minnesota Twins another divisional title in March, but it was Cleveland who had the best record in baseball at several points during the year, racing out to a 51-26 start that nobody saw coming. Not expected to contend, the Guardians were led by Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez, still the best player nobody talks about, and Emanuel Clase, the most dominant closer in baseball. The Tigers were sellers at the deadline, dealing away multiple veterans including pitcher Jack Flaherty to the Dodgers. Then they started winning, moving from nine games under .500 on 4 July into the playoffs, finishing with a 47-28 stretch backed by southpaw Cy Young candidate Tarik Skubal. The Royals had the greatest turnaround in baseball, rebounding from a 106-loss season to 86 wins and a wildcard berth. That\u2019s mostly thanks to a rotation as good as any in the AL led by Seth Lugo and Cole Ragans, while Bobby Witt Jr put in a MVP-caliber season. Then there\u2019s the Mets, in a self-proclaimed \u201ctransition season\u201d, who were 11 games under .500 in late May and facing a long summer of empty seats and roster rejigging. Thanks to a McDonald\u2019s mascot, the emergence of Francisco Lindor, a surprising pitching rotation and a resurgent lineup, the team streaked to the best record in baseball from June onwards, earning a playoff spot during a makeup doubleheader a day after the regular season ended. Throw in the Dodgers, Yankees, Phillies, Brewers and Astros, and we entered these playoffs with an eclectic mix of haves and have-nots battling it out. Star wattage They\u2019re out, finally. Aaron Judge, who missed out on the 2023 postseason, returned to the playoffs after another Mickey Mantle-esqye season in center field for the Yankees. Even when he\u2019s invisible, as he was in the Yankees\u2019 ALDS win over Kansas City, every at-bat is a must-see. Will he finally break out of the .620 OPS slump against Cleveland in the ALCS? Across town, Lindor emerged as a team leader and bona fide megastar following an MVP-like season. After a historic blast that sent New York into the playoffs, he topped it with a grand slam that sunk Philly in Game 4, propelling New York into the NLCS. There was a time not long ago Mets fans thought Cleveland may have won the trade that brought Lindor to New York. Now he\u2019s one of MLB\u2019s most prized assets. Soon-to-be-AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal propelled the Tigers past the heavily favored Astros, and to the brink of an ALCS appearance before bowing out against the Guardians. Young Skubal has only just begun, and if he can stay healthy, will emerge as a true MLB superstar. And of course there\u2019s Shohei Ohtani, by far baseball\u2019s most recognizable face, who played for years on a stage with a low ceiling in Anaheim. Now he\u2019s finally in the playoffs, and should be for sometime on the deep-pocketed Dodgers. Could he become the first MLB player since Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter to transcend the sport in the US? A big-market matchup with the Mets in the NLCS should help. Unforgettable moments It\u2019s hard to find magical moments in any non-competitive series, but each of this year\u2019s four divisional series started out with 1-1 deadlocks with two of them going the five-game distance. That said, it was the wildcard round that provided the most theatrical moment of the season. Soon-to-be-free agent slugger Pete Alonso, who most Mets fans would have been happy to let go of after an underwhelming regular season, struck what is arguably the most dramatic home run in franchise history in the decisive Game 3 at Milwaukee. His top-of-the-ninth, three-run dinger instantly cemented his place in Mets lore in what has to be one of the most instantaneous 180-degree swings experienced by even the most fickle of fanbases. The Guardians were seeking a 2-0 ALDS lead over the Tigers in what had been a tense, drama-filled scoreless match-up. Then in the top of the ninth, Kerry Carpenter pinch hit for the Tigers. Facing the Cleveland closer Clase, who had a regular season 0.61 ERA, he stroked a three-run blast that shocked Progressive Field in Cleveland into an Erie quiet. It couldn\u2019t get any bigger for the Mets after Alonso\u2019s shot, until the aforementioned Lindor grand slam blast ended the Phillies\u2019 hopes of sending the series back to Philadelphia for a decisive Game 5 and a date with ace Zack Wheeler. And finally, in a decisive Game 5 of the ALDS, Lane Thomas knocked Detroit\u2019s Skubal off his peak, at least for now, with a fifth-inning grand slam that would propel the $109m payroll minnows to a big-money match-up with the Yankees for the right to represent the American League in the World Series. Fun! While the opening stages of the 2024 playoffs have been entertaining for their competitive match-ups and big moments, there was also a good amount of gamesmanship in between. The Mets\u2019 Jesse Winker became the chief heel against Milwaukee, prompting Willy Adames to invite Winker to the parking lot post-game to settle scores. Only Adames showed. In Game 2 of the NLDS, the Padres\u2019 Manny Machado, leading a team packed with Dennis Rodman-type provocateurs, also challenged Dodgers hurler Jack Flaherty to a post-game duel in a parking lot, which seems to be the current MLB venue of choice for fights that will never happen. Also in Game 2, Machado also may have or may not have purposely thrown a ball at Dodgers manager David Roberts in between innings, leading even more beef between teams with a long legacy of Southern California skirmishes. And amazingly, also in Game 2, Pads left fielder Jurickson Profar began a feud with Dodgers fans, taunting LA supporters after denying Mookie Betts a home run, an incident that had an ugly ending. And benches cleared in Game 4 of the ALDS between the Yankees and Royals, which rightly or wrongly always gets our attention. And finally, Max Muncy followed that profane soundbite by Kik\u00e9 Hernandez with a another one after the Dodgers ousted their hated division rivals in a tight Game 5. \u201cWhat was it, 80% of the fucking experts said we were going to lose?\u201d Muncy said. \u201cFuck those guys. We know who we are. We\u2019re the fucking best team in baseball, and we\u2019re out there to prove it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.stagerestaurant.co.uk/\">Stage</a>, 31 Magdalen Road, Exeter EX2 4TA (01392 496700). Four-course lunch \u00a330, six-course dinner \u00a355, wine from \u00a326</strong></p> <p>Smart, creative people tend towards the ambitious. They know what they\u2019re doing right now is good, but hope that at some point in the future they will do it better. They are forever striving towards a goal which is just out of reach. The risk is that, with their eyes on that future, they fail to clock what they have in the present. The coolly talented young team at Stage in Exeter are clearly ambitious, but I very much hope they are able to live as deeply in the present tense as possible. It would be a crying shame if, when they move on to the bigger and greater things that doubtless await them, they only realise in retrospect the brilliance of what they had going on now; here in this tiny 20-seater restaurant, where the walls are skirted with corrugated iron, the high wooden tables are built on black steel frames and the toasted cashews come crusted with something called apple sriracha.</p> <p>Stage serves exceedingly well priced, wittily crafted tasting menus, which are only announced as the dishes arrive. Six courses in the evening costs \u00a355; four courses at lunch are \u00a330. As they change regularly, what I\u2019m about to describe may not quite match the pictures. No matter. Just know it\u2019s all bloody good. The restaurant is defined by a commitment to produce or make as much of it as they can. Various fruit and veg are described as coming from \u201cGranny\u2019s garden\u201d, by which they literally mean the Bodmin garden belonging to the grandmother of one of the chef-partners\u2019 girlfriends. As well as growing produce, they have a shipping container there, where they make their own beers, cure their own meats and quite possibly knit their own yoghurt.</p>    <p>The charcuterie serves as the \u201cchef\u2019s snacks\u201d: there are deep purple discs of a lightly spiced venison salami, with a pleasing tang of armpit. There are silky folds of 24-month-aged ham, at room temperature so the luscious fat immediately begins to melt on the tongue, as well as rolls of tense bresaola. There\u2019s also their own jerky. There\u2019s no point pretending. Jerky, even the good stuff, which this is, looks like scabs, harvested on day seven. Shift that image, because these are dense but soft and smoky and rich. Have all this with a boulder of their pillowy white bread, which arrives shorn of its crusts, torn and then toasted, and slicked with melted butter so it has crisp golden peaks and crenelations. Alongside is a butter whipped with a little beef fat for depth and dusted green with garlic powder for breathiness. The bread, I am told, is baked in huge table-sized loaves. The ripped-off crusts are then ground down and fermented in the jars over there on the shelves to make a kind of miso.</p>    <p>This might all sound unbearably cheffy, but it\u2019s worth knowing that the team, who met while working at Cornwall\u2019s <a href=\"https://enodoc-hotel.co.uk/\">St Enodoc Hotel</a> in Rock, started out in 2019 as an outfit called the Taco Boys. They served filled folds of flatbread from a converted horse box on Polzeath Beach, and admitted the name was misdirection because nothing about it was Mexican. \u201cA taco is just a holdable plate that folds,\u201d Taco Boy Felix Craft said at the time. Now they have actual plates. The first of these arrives bearing thick, crunchy discs of kohlrabi, fermented in whey to give them a sour tang. There is a smoked chilli cream underneath and across the top, what they call a \u201cchicken liver jus\u201d. It is a ridiculously deep-flavoured glossy, liquid chicken-liver parfait. Bring me a mug of that and a straw.</p> <p>Next up are slices of sirloin steak bathed in a miso and caper butter, as insistent and pleasing as a low note on a tuba, and laid across what they call a swede terrine. It\u2019s a buttery, vertical dauphinoise and lifts this ugly bastard of the vegetable world up to supermodel status. Underneath, to smooth out any sharp edges, is a velvety cauliflower pur\u00e9e. It\u2019s followed by a succotash: buttercup-yellow kernels of sweetcorn, which pop between the teeth, bound by a reduced sauce of cream and stock, and dotted with the intense caramel of a burnt onion relish. Three bronzed and crisped gnocchi are laid across the top. They could have stopped there; if you\u2019re a non-meat eater assume that they will. But each of my gnocchi comes draped in a gossamer shroud of their own piggy lardo, melting lightly in the heat.</p>    <p>The last savoury course is a crisp-skinned fillet of grey mullet, perched on Tenderstem broccoli and smoky <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/10/nigel-slater-baba-ghanoush-recipe\">baba ganoush</a> and dressed with what they call a \u201cpinenut, cucumber and wheat berry salsa verde\u201d. It sits in a fragrant puddle of dill oil, which I\u2019m tempted to dab behind my ears in the hope of attracting beautiful Scandinavian people. As there\u2019s no written menu every dish must be recited tableside, possibly quite slowly for the chap with the notebook and pen at table two. It means that at times a touch of word spaghetti becomes pronounced. Is that mess of pinenuts, wheat and cucumber really a salsa verde? Nah, but it sounds good. And the thing about the bread being \u201chand torn\u201d? How else are you going to tear bread? With your feet? At one point, two tempura-ed purple beans arrive, isolated on a plate beneath a grating of cured egg yolk and gruy\u00e8re. It\u2019s probably meant to celebrate impeccable ingredients, but it ends up feeling a little performative. But if the best I can do by way of criticism is to say they are pushing at the boundaries of what they can do and sometimes tip just over the edge into silliness, it\u2019s no criticism at all.</p>    <p>The first sweet course is a foamy pear cream dusted thickly with blackberry powder, enclosing a denser heart of pistachio kulfi and stewed pear. That is followed by a minor miracle of an apple tarte tatin, made with the thinnest ribbons of fruit, glazed with a \u201chibiscus, whisky, miso\u201d caramel, which makes it both a little boozy and a little salty. The tart is pale yellow, rather than deep amber, and yet crisp as you like. With it is a scoop of raspberry ice-cream. By itself you might conclude it is undersweetened. But against the tart it is the essence of refreshing. And all of this, served with a twinkly eyed enthusiasm, as if they know just how fabulous everything they\u2019re doing is and are delighted you\u2019re experiencing it. Quite right, too. But please, people: make sure to live in the moment.</p> <h2><strong>News bites</strong></h2> <p>First, all too familiar news of closures. Former <em>MasterChef</em> winner Simon Wood has announced the end after seven years of his eponymous Manchester restaurant. As he explained on Instagram: \u201cSadly with Covid rent arrears now being demanded by our landlord and an increasingly difficult marketplace, energy increases, ingredient costs and soon to be spiralling business rates, we just cannot make this work.\u201d Meanwhile in Leeds, Michael O\u2019Hare has closed his restaurant, Psycho Sandbar, which opened as a more relaxed replacement for Man Behind the Curtain just seven months ago. His rather less clear explanation was that the decision was based on his own plans, but was also \u201creflective of the changing experience market in which we all live\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Manchester, there\u2019s a slightly complicated rebranding of the Japanese-inspired Musu on Bridge Street.

      "bodyText": "Stage, 31 Magdalen Road, Exeter EX2 4TA (01392 496700). Four-course lunch \u00a330, six-course dinner \u00a355, wine from \u00a326 Smart, creative people tend towards the ambitious. They know what they\u2019re doing right now is good, but hope that at some point in the future they will do it better. They are forever striving towards a goal which is just out of reach. The risk is that, with their eyes on that future, they fail to clock what they have in the present. The coolly talented young team at Stage in Exeter are clearly ambitious, but I very much hope they are able to live as deeply in the present tense as possible. It would be a crying shame if, when they move on to the bigger and greater things that doubtless await them, they only realise in retrospect the brilliance of what they had going on now; here in this tiny 20-seater restaurant, where the walls are skirted with corrugated iron, the high wooden tables are built on black steel frames and the toasted cashews come crusted with something called apple sriracha. Stage serves exceedingly well priced, wittily crafted tasting menus, which are only announced as the dishes arrive. Six courses in the evening costs \u00a355; four courses at lunch are \u00a330. As they change regularly, what I\u2019m about to describe may not quite match the pictures. No matter. Just know it\u2019s all bloody good. The restaurant is defined by a commitment to produce or make as much of it as they can. Various fruit and veg are described as coming from \u201cGranny\u2019s garden\u201d, by which they literally mean the Bodmin garden belonging to the grandmother of one of the chef-partners\u2019 girlfriends. As well as growing produce, they have a shipping container there, where they make their own beers, cure their own meats and quite possibly knit their own yoghurt. The charcuterie serves as the \u201cchef\u2019s snacks\u201d: there are deep purple discs of a lightly spiced venison salami, with a pleasing tang of armpit. There are silky folds of 24-month-aged ham, at room temperature so the luscious fat immediately begins to melt on the tongue, as well as rolls of tense bresaola. There\u2019s also their own jerky. There\u2019s no point pretending. Jerky, even the good stuff, which this is, looks like scabs, harvested on day seven. Shift that image, because these are dense but soft and smoky and rich. Have all this with a boulder of their pillowy white bread, which arrives shorn of its crusts, torn and then toasted, and slicked with melted butter so it has crisp golden peaks and crenelations. Alongside is a butter whipped with a little beef fat for depth and dusted green with garlic powder for breathiness. The bread, I am told, is baked in huge table-sized loaves. The ripped-off crusts are then ground down and fermented in the jars over there on the shelves to make a kind of miso. This might all sound unbearably cheffy, but it\u2019s worth knowing that the team, who met while working at Cornwall\u2019s St Enodoc Hotel in Rock, started out in 2019 as an outfit called the Taco Boys. They served filled folds of flatbread from a converted horse box on Polzeath Beach, and admitted the name was misdirection because nothing about it was Mexican. \u201cA taco is just a holdable plate that folds,\u201d Taco Boy Felix Craft said at the time. Now they have actual plates. The first of these arrives bearing thick, crunchy discs of kohlrabi, fermented in whey to give them a sour tang. There is a smoked chilli cream underneath and across the top, what they call a \u201cchicken liver jus\u201d. It is a ridiculously deep-flavoured glossy, liquid chicken-liver parfait. Bring me a mug of that and a straw. Next up are slices of sirloin steak bathed in a miso and caper butter, as insistent and pleasing as a low note on a tuba, and laid across what they call a swede terrine. It\u2019s a buttery, vertical dauphinoise and lifts this ugly bastard of the vegetable world up to supermodel status. Underneath, to smooth out any sharp edges, is a velvety cauliflower pur\u00e9e. It\u2019s followed by a succotash: buttercup-yellow kernels of sweetcorn, which pop between the teeth, bound by a reduced sauce of cream and stock, and dotted with the intense caramel of a burnt onion relish. Three bronzed and crisped gnocchi are laid across the top. They could have stopped there; if you\u2019re a non-meat eater assume that they will. But each of my gnocchi comes draped in a gossamer shroud of their own piggy lardo, melting lightly in the heat. The last savoury course is a crisp-skinned fillet of grey mullet, perched on Tenderstem broccoli and smoky baba ganoush and dressed with what they call a \u201cpinenut, cucumber and wheat berry salsa verde\u201d. It sits in a fragrant puddle of dill oil, which I\u2019m tempted to dab behind my ears in the hope of attracting beautiful Scandinavian people. As there\u2019s no written menu every dish must be recited tableside, possibly quite slowly for the chap with the notebook and pen at table two. It means that at times a touch of word spaghetti becomes pronounced. Is that mess of pinenuts, wheat and cucumber really a salsa verde? Nah, but it sounds good. And the thing about the bread being \u201chand torn\u201d? How else are you going to tear bread? With your feet? At one point, two tempura-ed purple beans arrive, isolated on a plate beneath a grating of cured egg yolk and gruy\u00e8re. It\u2019s probably meant to celebrate impeccable ingredients, but it ends up feeling a little performative. But if the best I can do by way of criticism is to say they are pushing at the boundaries of what they can do and sometimes tip just over the edge into silliness, it\u2019s no criticism at all. The first sweet course is a foamy pear cream dusted thickly with blackberry powder, enclosing a denser heart of pistachio kulfi and stewed pear. That is followed by a minor miracle of an apple tarte tatin, made with the thinnest ribbons of fruit, glazed with a \u201chibiscus, whisky, miso\u201d caramel, which makes it both a little boozy and a little salty. The tart is pale yellow, rather than deep amber, and yet crisp as you like. With it is a scoop of raspberry ice-cream. By itself you might conclude it is undersweetened. But against the tart it is the essence of refreshing. And all of this, served with a twinkly eyed enthusiasm, as if they know just how fabulous everything they\u2019re doing is and are delighted you\u2019re experiencing it. Quite right, too. But please, people: make sure to live in the moment. News bites First, all too familiar news of closures. Former MasterChef winner Simon Wood has announced the end after seven years of his eponymous Manchester restaurant. As he explained on Instagram: \u201cSadly with Covid rent arrears now being demanded by our landlord and an increasingly difficult marketplace, energy increases, ingredient costs and soon to be spiralling business rates, we just cannot make this work.\u201d Meanwhile in Leeds, Michael O\u2019Hare has closed his restaurant, Psycho Sandbar, which opened as a more relaxed replacement for Man Behind the Curtain just seven months ago. His rather less clear explanation was that the decision was based on his own plans, but was also \u201creflective of the changing experience market in which we all live\u201d. Elsewhere in Manchester, there\u2019s a slightly complicated rebranding of the Japanese-inspired Musu on Bridge Street. Steven Smith, formerly the head chef of the Freemasons at Wiswell, will head up Kaji by Musu. Diners paying \u00a3120 a head for the tasting menu will apparently be invited \u201cto embark on a unique journey where fire and flavour come together in perfect harmony\u201d. And so on. Next year, the basement will become home to an even more high-end 18-seat kitchen-counter restaurant called Musu Miyabi, and a second omakase operation called Musu Theatre (musumcr.com). And finally, JD Wetherspoon\u2019s annual revenues have passed \u00a32bn for the first time, up 4.9% in the year to 28 July. Pre-tax profits have risen 73.5% from \u00a346.2m to \u00a379.3m.

      "bodyText": "England secured back-to-back WXV1 titles with a classy 21-12 comeback victory against Canada. It was a 20th successive win for the Red Roses and confirmed them as the hot favourites for the 2025 Rugby World Cup in August. In a tightly fought contest, England outlasted the home side with three tries and stout defence. Canada pushed England in the 2022 World Cup semi\u2011finals, and defeated New Zealand to win the Pacific Four Series this year. With big WXV victories against France and Ireland, they entered this showdown as world No 2. If anyone could beat England it was Canada, and if it was ever to happen, it was now. England, though, were on a march of their own. After an adjustment period in the Six Nations and an easy win against USA in the first round, everything clicked for John Mitchell\u2019s side last Sunday as Jess Breach, Abby Dow and Ellie Kildunne ran riot with a combined seven tries in an exhilarating WXV1 win against their old rivals and the 2022 world champions, New Zealand. Yet Canada dominated early, winning a penalty within 20 seconds of kick\u2011off and laid siege to England\u2019s line. Despite six successive victories, the home side had lost their past 12 against the Red Roses so showed their intent by spurning three points to chase five. After three furious minutes of mauling, Justine Pelletier\u2019s snipe from a metre out secured a 5-0 lead. England bit back in the ninth minute when the prop Maud Muir finished a strong charge downfield by Alex Matthews and Helena Rowland slotted the conversion to give England a 7-5 lead. As the game settled, the teams traded attacking thrusts and fatigue became a factor, mistakes keeping both sides\u2019 scoring in check. Despite England\u2019s 73% possession, Canada\u2019s relentless offloading kept them alive. The Vancouver crowd roared as their team assailed England\u2019s line late in the half. But too often they took an inside channel when overlaps existed out wide and each time England\u2019s last line of defence held up would-be try scorers over the line. Canada carried their momentum into the second half and when England\u2019s Kildunne was shown a yellow card for a cynical offside play to kill another break, the Red Roses were in trouble. Canada used the advantage to rip through the middle with fast passes and runners and the captain, Alex Tessier, finished a brilliant movement in the 51st minute by slicing inside and scoring under the posts to restore a 12-7 lead. England had won 49 of their previous 50 Tests, including 19 consecutive victories since their defeat by New Zealand at the 2022 World Cup final. Canada sniffed the upset and the crowd sensed it, too. A torrent of red jerseys poured into England territory and, as Kildunne returned, Bo Westcombe-Evans departed for a deliberate knock-on. Canada continued to stretch England and when they finally won a lineout, having lost six in the opening hour, a try seemed certain. But another forward final pass under pressure squandered what might have been a 10-point lead. England cashed in on the reprieve, rumbling up the middle to send Sarah Burn over from a low drive.

The Israeli government has long regarded Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy, as a threat, a view compounded by the organisation\u2019s decision to fire rockets into northern Israel from 8 October, the day after the Hamas attack on southern Israel which killed about 1,200 people. While Israel initially said its attacks on Hezbollah were intended to ensure the return of thousands of Israelis to their homes near the border with Lebanon, the broadening escalation has sparked increasing fears of a regional war. Lebanon\u2019s displaced Shia community, huddling in makeshift shelters and bare apartments, might be suffering the immediate shock of displacement in the short term, said Talib, but looked to Hezbollah\u2019s record of rebuilding much of southern Lebanon and fighting Israel\u2019s previous occupation of the area as evidence it could care for them for the long haul. \u201cThis party, this special party, liberated their land and gave them the opportunity to go back to their villages and enjoy their lives \u2013 they will be with it no matter what, even if it lost its leaders out of nowhere,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if they lost a battle, they won\u2019t lose the war,\u201d she added. \u201cPeople believe in the party based on their previous experiences. There\u2019s no war without losses, but the winner is the one who wins the last battle.\u201d",
