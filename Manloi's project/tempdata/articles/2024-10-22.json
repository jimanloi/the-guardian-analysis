In Western Australia on Friday, Dutton accused Bunbury-based ABC reporter Bridget McArthur of being an ideological advocate and \u201cplaying games\u201d after she asked him whether the locals in Collie supported his nuclear power plants proposal. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the politics at the ABC,\u201d Dutton replied. \u201cYou can all be advocates and play your games.\u201d She had asked him: \u201cHow do you know the vast majority of the public in Collie support the plan?\u201d Dutton: \u201cWell, how do you know that they don\u2019t?\u201d McArthur: \u201cWell, I have spoken to a number of them.

Earlier this month ABC reporter Anushri Sood asked Dutton about comments he made regarding the ban on Hezbollah\u2019s flag, with the reporter questioning why there are \u201cno bans currently on Israeli flags being raised\u201d at rallies \u201cdespite 45,000 people dying at the hands of the Israeli government\u201d. Dutton responded by demanding to know where the reporter was from and to repeat the question. \u201cThey organise terrorist attacks and if that is not clear to the ABC, then I think the ABC is in greater trouble than even I first imagined,\u201d Dutton said. Percy said the opposition leader showed himself to be thin-skinned and \u201cunnecessarily aggressive in his responses\u201d. \u201cAs we head towards what will be a keenly contested election we expect journalists to be respected for the job they are doing which is to hold the powerful to account and act in the public interest.\u201d ABC News said in a statement it stood by its reporters. \u201cABC journalists ask questions every day on behalf of the public,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cIt\u2019s their job to do that and they will never shy away from that.\u201d In relation to the Hezbollah question, the ABC said: \u201cHezbollah is listed as a terrorist organisation by the Australian Government and the ABC recognises that in its coverage.\u201d Friday\u2019s clash with Dutton saw the ABC reporter stand her ground. \u201cYou always make it about the ABC,\u201d McArthur said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a bias, you might have a bias against the ABC. \u201cYou can ask [climate change and energy minister] Chris Bowen the kind of questions I ask him and I promise you I don\u2019t,\u201d she continued. Dutton responded that she had the choice between being an \u201cadvocate or a journalist\u201d and added that the ABC was \u201cusing\u201d taxpayer money.

How do they stack up?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet that\u2019s precisely what she did. Where was the lie in stating that in the name of colonisation, Aboriginal lands, remains and children had been stolen? That there was no treaty? That there had not been an agreement with First Peoples to be a part of the empire? That our sovereignty remains to this day?</p> \n<p>In cultural institutions across the UK and Europe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/10/remains-of-18-indigenous-people-held-by-uk-museums-return-to-australia\">are many Aboriginal human remains</a>, stolen from this country. In many instances, these remains were used by scientists, anthropologists and eugenicists to \u201cprove\u201d Aboriginal inferiority and justify colonisation. Some concerted community efforts have seen the repatriation of remains, but there were so many taken and there is so far to go.</p> \n<p>Since the beginning of colonisation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have consistently engaged in acts of resistance. Contrary to the idea that Thorpe\u2019s \u201crudeness\u201d was a generational thing that would not have happened in previous decades of activism, this resistance was not all polite.</p> \n<p>There was nothing polite about Pemulwuy or raids and guerrilla war tactics. There was nothing polite about the freedom riders fighting for Aboriginal kids to have access to public pools and highlight apartheid in regional New South Wales. Sticking a beach umbrella in the lawns at Old Parliament House and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/fifty-years-of-resistance-aboriginal-tent-embassy-began-with-an-umbrella-and-became-a-symbol-of-sovereignty\">declaring the area the Aboriginal Tent Embassy</a> wasn\u2019t polite. I don\u2019t remember the first rally I attended as a kid \u2013 the convergence at the opening of new Parliament House \u2013 being polite as Aboriginal people marched, chanting \u201cLand rights now, bicentennial bullshit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Working \u201cwithin the system\u201d, rather than taking these actions, is also necessary. Mabo may have been more polite in his tactics, but he still used the imposed Australian legal system to dismember one of Australia\u2019s longest-standing legal lies. When Thorpe undertook her mandatory oath of office, there was nothing polite about her being censured by the Speaker because she inserted \u201ccolonising\u201d before \u201cqueen\u201d, and then retook the entire thing in a mocking tone full of purposeful mispronunciations to highlight the spectacle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"069b8a07-d3e0-449c-b3d1-dbfc0bab6142\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HAJQ_K_CzCE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Last year, Australia showed how unengaged and racist this country remains by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/14/australian-voters-reject-proposal-for-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-at-historic-referendum\">refusing to insert an Indigenous advisory voice</a> into a constitution that still contains racist passages. Yet fast-forward 12 months, and we are supposed to be bowing and scraping at the figurehead whose institution this land was claimed in the name of, while not showing up the country that cannot even grant us a tokenistic gesture. The idea of this is, frankly, absurd.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s simple: the Crown remains the figurehead of British colonisation and Indigenous dispossession. As the current hat-wearer, Charles III is the representative of Australia\u2019s subservience to the Commonwealth, and the original crime of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2017/jun/03/mabo-25-years-on-lets-look-at-the-vast-absurdist-fiction-this-ruling-toppled\"> false </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2017/jun/03/mabo-25-years-on-lets-look-at-the-vast-absurdist-fiction-this-ruling-toppled\">terra nullius</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2017/jun/03/mabo-25-years-on-lets-look-at-the-vast-absurdist-fiction-this-ruling-toppled\"> declaration</a> to clear the way for this to occur. Challenging royal authority has a long and proud history in the Indigenous community, and perhaps if Australians engaged in actual truth-telling, such as what the Albanese government committed to when promising to implement the Uluru statement in full, hearing these truths would not come as such a shock.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/21/lidia-thorpe-who-is-the-mp-who-accused-king-charles-of-genocide-in-fiery-confrontation-in-australian-parliament-ntwnfb\">Lidia Thorpe: who is the MP who accused King Charles of genocide in fiery confrontation in Australian parliament?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For what it\u2019s worth, I was informed by an older Aboriginal person about Thorpe\u2019s actions. They had been watching the news footage live and rang to tell me immediately. There was no shame in their voice, just pride \u2013 pride that Thorpe had seized the opportunity, asked some questions so many Aboriginal people are still waiting, after two centuries, to get the answers to, and pride that the Auslan interpreter saw fit to continue relaying Thorpe\u2019s message to the deaf community of Australia.</p> \n<p>I share this pride, and if my social media today is any indication, so do so many other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly those who have staged protests throughout the entirety of the royal visit that the media has barely seen fit to cover. If the country really does want this to change, perhaps it\u2019s time they engaged with the points raised by Thorpe and worked to change them.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Celeste Liddle is an Arrernte woman living in Melbourne.

Yet that\u2019s precisely what she did. Where was the lie in stating that in the name of colonisation, Aboriginal lands, remains and children had been stolen? That there was no treaty? That there had not been an agreement with First Peoples to be a part of the empire? That our sovereignty remains to this day? In cultural institutions across the UK and Europe are many Aboriginal human remains, stolen from this country. In many instances, these remains were used by scientists, anthropologists and eugenicists to \u201cprove\u201d Aboriginal inferiority and justify colonisation. Some concerted community efforts have seen the repatriation of remains, but there were so many taken and there is so far to go. Since the beginning of colonisation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have consistently engaged in acts of resistance. Contrary to the idea that Thorpe\u2019s \u201crudeness\u201d was a generational thing that would not have happened in previous decades of activism, this resistance was not all polite. There was nothing polite about Pemulwuy or raids and guerrilla war tactics. There was nothing polite about the freedom riders fighting for Aboriginal kids to have access to public pools and highlight apartheid in regional New South Wales. Sticking a beach umbrella in the lawns at Old Parliament House and declaring the area the Aboriginal Tent Embassy wasn\u2019t polite. I don\u2019t remember the first rally I attended as a kid \u2013 the convergence at the opening of new Parliament House \u2013 being polite as Aboriginal people marched, chanting \u201cLand rights now, bicentennial bullshit.\u201d Working \u201cwithin the system\u201d, rather than taking these actions, is also necessary. Mabo may have been more polite in his tactics, but he still used the imposed Australian legal system to dismember one of Australia\u2019s longest-standing legal lies. When Thorpe undertook her mandatory oath of office, there was nothing polite about her being censured by the Speaker because she inserted \u201ccolonising\u201d before \u201cqueen\u201d, and then retook the entire thing in a mocking tone full of purposeful mispronunciations to highlight the spectacle. Last year, Australia showed how unengaged and racist this country remains by refusing to insert an Indigenous advisory voice into a constitution that still contains racist passages. Yet fast-forward 12 months, and we are supposed to be bowing and scraping at the figurehead whose institution this land was claimed in the name of, while not showing up the country that cannot even grant us a tokenistic gesture. The idea of this is, frankly, absurd. It\u2019s simple: the Crown remains the figurehead of British colonisation and Indigenous dispossession. As the current hat-wearer, Charles III is the representative of Australia\u2019s subservience to the Commonwealth, and the original crime of the false terra nullius declaration to clear the way for this to occur. Challenging royal authority has a long and proud history in the Indigenous community, and perhaps if Australians engaged in actual truth-telling, such as what the Albanese government committed to when promising to implement the Uluru statement in full, hearing these truths would not come as such a shock. For what it\u2019s worth, I was informed by an older Aboriginal person about Thorpe\u2019s actions. They had been watching the news footage live and rang to tell me immediately. There was no shame in their voice, just pride \u2013 pride that Thorpe had seized the opportunity, asked some questions so many Aboriginal people are still waiting, after two centuries, to get the answers to, and pride that the Auslan interpreter saw fit to continue relaying Thorpe\u2019s message to the deaf community of Australia. I share this pride, and if my social media today is any indication, so do so many other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly those who have staged protests throughout the entirety of the royal visit that the media has barely seen fit to cover. If the country really does want this to change, perhaps it\u2019s time they engaged with the points raised by Thorpe and worked to change them. \u2022 Celeste Liddle is an Arrernte woman living in Melbourne.

      "bodyText": "The federal court has granted Bruce Lehrmann a stay of the $2m costs order made by Justice Michael Lee, allowing an appeal against the dismissal of his defamation suit against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson to go ahead. Justice Wendy Abraham also dismissed Ten and Wilkinson\u2019s application for Lehrmann to pay a $200,000 security for the costs of the upcoming appeal. In a short hearing on Wednesday Abraham ordered Ten to pay the legal costs incurred by Lehrmann in opposing the costs order. In April, Lee found Lehrmann was not defamed by Ten and Wilkinson when The Project broadcast an interview with Brittany Higgins on 15 February 2021 in which she alleged she was raped by a staffer. In her published reasons, Abraham said Lee\u2019s finding that, on the balance of probabilities, \u201cMr Lehrmann raped Ms Higgins\u201d \u201cis extremely serious\u201d and the appellate process is a \u201cfundamental aspect of the administration of justice\u201d. \u201cIn all the circumstances, I do not accept the respondents\u2019 submissions that there is no public interest, in the relevant sense, in the appeal,\u201d Abraham said. Abraham said Lehrmann is on Centrelink benefits and penniless so Ten has \u201cno basis for thinking that it will retrieve\u201d the $2m it is owed. \u201cIn that circumstance, it is unclear what the prejudice to the respondents [Ten and Wilkinson] is said to be if the costs order was stayed pending the appeal.\u201d Abraham said aspects of Ten and Wilkinson\u2019s case had failed at trial and all parties now claimed Lee\u2019s judgment contained errors. \u201cAs the appellant essentially submitted, the finding against him is extremely serious,\u201d she said. \u201cMs Wilkinson described it as a finding of criminal conduct. The impact on him if he is denied that right is self-evident.\u201d Abraham said the respondents will incur costs during the appeal which, even if the respondent loses, will likely be unrecoverable. \u201cNonetheless, I am not persuaded, given the considerations relevant to the particular facts and circumstances of this case, that an order for security ought to be made.\u201d Lehrmann\u2019s lawyer Zali Burrows argued in her submission there was a genuine public interest in allowing an appeal and a risk that if the security of costs is granted it may abort any appeal. The former Liberal staffer was going to represent himself in the appeal but retained the criminal solicitor at the 11th hour. Abraham said the respondents accept the grounds for appeal \u201care at least arguable\u201d and that any costs order would be overturned if the appeal succeeds. If she had allowed the costs order Lehrmann would likely be declared bankrupt, which would affect his prosecution of any appeal. Lehrmann was not in court for the hearings or the decision. Burrows said her client was too \u201cscared\u201d to attend court since becoming \u201carguably Australia\u2019s most hated man\u201d and the publicity surrounding the defamation trial had \u201csmashed\u201d his mental health. Lehrmann has always denied the rape allegation and pleaded not guilty at his criminal trial in the Australian Capital Territory supreme court which was aborted. Prosecutors did not seek a retrial due to concerns about Higgins\u2019s mental health.",

According to the latest edition of the Ibrahim index of African governance, 78% of Africa\u2019s citizens live in a country where security and democracy deteriorated between 2014 and 2023. \u201cAfrica is not disconnected from what\u2019s going on around the world and you can see the global order is breaking down everywhere,\u201d Ibrahim told the Guardian. \u201cYou can see many people breaching international law with impunity.\u201d \u201cI think the moral threshold is coming down, unfortunately, globally, and that applies to us in this part of the world. Look how many \u2018strongmen\u2019 we have around the world. Now it\u2019s been normalised.\u201d The report said the result had been a stalling of progress in governance across Africa, with effects on health and education, though the results were not uniform across the continent, with half the countries experiencing deteriorating overall governance and the other half seeing progress. The study, which is published every two years, measures the performance of African governments in the fields of security and law; participation, rights and inclusion; economic opportunity; and human development, which includes health and education. While the worst deterioration in the measures studied was in security and safety, democracy, including participation, rights and transparency, also deteriorated. A large part of this deterioration was due to crackdowns on freedom of assembly \u2013 with people in 29 countries having \u201csubstantially\u201d less freedom to come together and share ideas \u2013 as well as on civil society and freedom of speech, especially in digital spaces. In the sub-category of security and safety, more than half the continent\u2019s population saw violence increase over the last five years. The lack of security was slowing progress for economic opportunity as well as in health, education, social protections and sustainability. The report highlighted 11 countries \u201con a concerning decade-long trend of deterioration\u201d, including Sudan \u2013 where the continuing conflict has caused what the UN described as \u201cone of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history\u201d \u2013 as well as the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Sahel region. Decade-long deteriorations were also seen in high-ranked countries. Mauritius (in second place), Botswana (fifth), Namibia (sixth), and Tunisia (ninth), though still ranking in 2023 among the 10 highest-scoring countries, also featured among the most deteriorated countries from 2014 to 2023. However, the report also highlighted rapid progress in overall governance by countries such as Seychelles, which now tops the index, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Benin and Angola. The report also said there was strong progress in infrastructure \u2013 thanks to the spread of mobile communications, internet and energy access \u2013 as well as women\u2019s equality, with better laws protecting women from violence, and better perception and representation of women in politics and leadership. Despite signs of progress in many countries, the public perception of how well governments are performing has dropped, especially in relation to economic opportunities, security and poverty. Ibrahim said this could be due to heightened expectations and also greater access to information from other parts of the world. \u201cThis is a problem, because if the perception keeps going down, this means people are getting more and more dissatisfied \u2026 That generates stress in society and that leads to conflicts and other things,\u201d said Ibrahim.",

Is Burton too an auteur, as the Design Museum\u2019s director has it, and as this efficiently kooky show takes for granted? If he is, then he has by now turned the gothic into a brand, projecting such a sharply stylised, recognisable version of homely horror that he can imprint it on almost any material and deliver the outlandish as bankable.</p> <p>This exhibition is a world touring event originally devised by Burton\u2019s \u201cin-house curatorial team\u201d that is making its final stop at the Design Museum in London. That accounts for the easily packed-up look of it all. It also accounts for its soft-centred, PR feel. It doesn\u2019t ask tough questions, such as how Burton works with technical crews and actors; or, more painfully, why his later output has been so uneven.</p> <p>Burton was not born, we learn, in a cobweb-covered gothic castle on the edge of town but in Burbank, California. It was apparently a suburban hell. This is made clear in the show\u2019s first space, where his early drawings, ranging from an anti-litter poster to experiments in horror, are hung on a stage set made of identical suburban house fronts. In case of confusion, Burton is on screen in an old South Bank show explaining how he rebelled against Burbank\u2019s sameness and sterility. A wall text is headlined \u201cSurviving Burbank\u201d yet we get no details of why he found the place so insufferable, or what his home was like.</p>    <p>Other youthful drawings show him already fascinated by Halloween and its denizens, portraying comedy monsters at their seasonal feast in cartoons that owe a lot to Edward Gorey and Charles Addams. Horror memorabilia on display includes a beautiful art nouveau edition of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s The Raven and a poster for the (very) cult film The Oblong Box, starring Vincent Price and Christopher Lee.</p> <p>This passion bore fruit in Burton\u2019s animated, 1982, black-and-white short film Vincent, showing here in its entirety, in which an American boy refuses to be all-American. He wants instead to be Vincent Price. A poem in voiceover, written by Burton, tells the blackly comic tale. It\u2019s a manifesto for an alternative American tradition, the gothic decadence of Price and Poe. The voiceover is by Price himself.</p> <p>Puppets of patched and sutured Sally, oogie boogie men, fiendish scientists and Jack Skellington show how, in his early features, Burton remained true to this alternative American gothic ideal. In a glass case, you meet Johnny Depp\u2019s leather suit from Edward Scissorhands complete with those very scissorhands.</p>    <p>Burton really did have a coherently subversive vision of the US in the 1980s and 90s. Edward Scissorhands creates a new American myth, from the samey plastic town where everyone aspires to fit in, to the spooky castle on the hill. Where would you rather live? And do you identify with the ghastly parents in the original 1988 Beetlejuice \u2013 or their goth daughter?</p> <p>This version of the gothic is, as Burton knows, as American as a pumpkin. Poe Americanised horror stories, turning away from ghosts towards decadence as characters improvise eerie violin tunes while their old houses fall around them. Looking at the Scissorhands costume, you realise how elegantly Burton made Poe\u2019s dark romanticism into a new bohemian model \u2013 and a commercial hit.</p>    <p>There\u2019s a clip here of the young Burton working as a Disney artist. He gazes blearily at the camera from hollow eyes as he drapes a long thin hand over a chair \u2013 for all the world a goth. It was for his drawings that he was employed by Disney. He still does detailed sketches, cartoons and paintings for his films. They are integral to the way Burton the auteur works, including his designs for the unmade projects Superman Lives and Pirates. But as art on a wall, these drawings don\u2019t make it. The sub-Goreyesque style, with a dash of Dr Seuss, that he perfected in his teens apparently still satisfies him. It doesn\u2019t satisfy me. The mediocrity of his pictorial style is obvious when he takes on stories previously illustrated by truly original artists. His drawings for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory are feeble compared with Quentin Blake\u2019s. And don\u2019t get me started on Burton v John Tenniel as illustrators of Alice.</p> <p>Then again, those two finished films are not up to much either. As you move on to cases full of costumes and props from various Burton \u201cclassics\u201d, you see how his intense early imagination turned into a kind of showy display of \u201cimagination\u201d. Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s Catwoman costume without her in it falls flat, although the snarling Martians from Mars Attacks! still have it.</p> <p>But how did a lover of American gothic make a film as cynical as Sleepy Hollow, which tramples all over Washington Irving\u2019s 1820 ghost story?

The article includes a \u201clearning point\u201d for other doctors, noting \u201cscurvy is a re-emerging disease with the rising cost of living\u201d. It points to the rising cost of food in Australia, making families more reliant on lower-cost foods, which tend to be poorer in nutritional value. The article also highlighted that the patient\u2019s obesity, previous bariatric surgery and low-income status were also among his risk factors for developing scurvy. Dermawan explained that because the stomach produces enzymes to break down nutritional components, people who have had part of their stomach removed through bariatric surgery can have trouble absorbing nutrients, making it a risk factor for scurvy alongside alcoholism, gastrointestinal disorders and being on dialysis. In 2016, diabetic patients at Westmead hospital in western Sydney were found to have symptoms of scurvy and reported they ate few vegetables, or overcooked them, destroying vitamin C. Dr Tim Senior, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners\u2019 specific interest group on poverty and health, said it was an important case report as the man could be a \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d. \u201cWhat they\u2019re describing in terms of cost-of-living pressures and the inability to afford good food, I think we are seeing more of that, definitely, and that will result in probably a whole range of micronutrient deficiencies, such as scurvy.\u201d While scurvy was the most notable diagnosis, Senior noted the man also had other nutrient deficiencies. Senior, who works for Tharawal Aboriginal Corporation\u2019s medical service in western Sydney, said he had seen patients losing weight because they couldn\u2019t afford to eat. Senior said poorer communities who are already known to be more likely to be in the unhealthy weight range are often more greatly affected by the problem of excess calories without nutrition. That in turn can result in conditions like obesity, which the authors identified as a risk factor for scurvy. \u201cFinancial resources affect people\u2019s health quite clearly \u2026 The way around that is understanding that\u2019s happening, acting on the cost-of-living crisis, so that everyone should be able to afford the food that keeps them well,\u201d Senior said.",

      "bodyText": "Green spaces in cities play a vital role in reducing illness and deaths caused by climate breakdown, according to the most comprehensive study of its kind. The findings of the review suggest that adding more parks, trees and greenery to urban areas could help countries tackle heat-related harms and improve public health. The record for the world\u2019s hottest day tumbled twice in one week earlier this year when the global average surface air temperature reached 17.15C (62.87F) breaking the record of 17.09C set days earlier. The climate crisis is driving up global temperatures as greenhouse gas emissions released when humans burn fossil fuels warm the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The overall beneficial effects of green spaces is well established, but until now their effects on heat-related health risks were poorly understood. Now a review of the evidence led by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine suggests that abundant green space in urban areas is linked to lower rates of heat-related illness and deaths, as well as better mental health and wellbeing. \u201cUrban green spaces play a vital role in mitigating heat-related health risks, offering a potential strategy for urban planning to address climate change and enhance public health,\u201d the researchers wrote in the journal BMJ Open. \u201cA review of urban greenery and its effect on heat-related morbidity and mortality suggests that urban green spaces, such as parks and trees, can have a positive impact on reducing the negative health effects associated with high temperatures,\u201d they added. \u201cStudies have found that areas with more green space have lower rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality compared with areas with less green space. Moreover, urban greenery can also have a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing, which can also contribute to reducing the negative health effects of high temperatures.\u201d In recognition of the harmful heat-related effects of climate breakdown, one of the UN\u2019s sustainable development targets stipulates the provision of universal access to safe and accessible green and public spaces, especially for vulnerable groups, such as children, elderly people, and those living with long-term conditions, by 2030. For the review, researchers looked at the effects of green zones on death and ill health in urban areas across the globe, drawing on relevant published research. They included content published in English between January 2000 and December 2022, and reviewed 12 studies out of an initial haul of more than 3,000 from Hong Kong, Australia, Vietnam, the US, South Korea, Portugal and Japan. These included epidemiological, modelling, and simulation studies, as well as experimental research and quantitative analyses. The review showed that urban green spaces such as parks and trees could help offset the adverse health effects of high temperatures. Areas with more green space had lower rates of heat-related ill health and death than areas with less green space, particularly among vulnerable groups. Access to green spaces is an example of health inequalities facing people worldwide. A Guardian investigation revealed earlier this year that children at the top 250 private schools in England had more than 10 times as much green space as those who go to state schools. Doctors also warned that a \u201ctruly alarming\u201d lack of access to green space for some families was exacerbating the child obesity crisis.",

Real Madrid gonna Real Madrid. One hundred and 43 days after they met at Wembley, the Champions League finalists faced each other again and Borussia Dortmund scored twice in four minutes midway through the first half, the quickest team to come here and take a two-goal lead in almost 20 years, so Real Madrid went and scored five even faster. \u201cWe went in at half-time shitting ourselves but we listened, we said get one, we\u2019ll come back again,\u201d the Brazilian revealed, and so it was. Madrid had gone into the dressing room 2-0 down, goals from Donyell Malen and the Reading-born Jamie Bynoe-Gittens giving Dortmund a lead they deserved. A banner before the game announced that this was Madrid\u2019s crown and Madrid\u2019s cup, which it always was and always will be, but at that stage it you wondered if it might just be Dortmund\u2019s night. History, though, has warned otherwise so many times, the ridiculous now routine, and here it was repeated. Madrid win, which is what they do, and ultimately they had deserved it too; their superb second half yielding five goals and underlining their candidacy for the trophy they like to think of as their own. Madrid went from 2-0 down to 2-2 in 103 seconds, the goals scored by Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Vin\u00edcius. Then Lucas V\u00e1zquez put them into the lead with seven minutes left, and less than one minute after Thibaut Courtois had saved them from trailing again.

The strikes are believed to have delayed a vessel carrying vegetable oil destined for the World Food Programme in Palestine.</p> <p>Ships loaded with grain destined for Egypt, two vessels carrying corn and WFP shipments bound for southern Africa were also affected, in some cases as collateral damage in strikes on port infrastructure.</p> <p>\u201cRussia\u2019s indiscriminate strikes on ports in the Black Sea underscore that Putin is willing to gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission,\u201d the prime minister said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cIn doing so, he is harming millions of vulnerable people across Africa, Asia and the Middle East, to try and gain the upper hand in his barbaric war.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer and Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, were urged at a meeting with British-Palestinian families on Tuesday to set up evacuation and resettlement schemes and take tougher measures against Israel\u2019s restrictions on aid entering Gaza.</p> <p>Health officials in the north of the Gaza Strip have warned they are running out of supplies to treat patients amid a renewed three-week-old Israeli offensive there.</p> <p>The Palestinian families called for a British personnel presence at border crossings in Gaza to ensure that inspections are carried out quickly and that aid flows unrestricted.</p> <p>Israel says aid has increased since the US government warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/us-israel-weapons-gaza-aid-letter\">in a leaked letter earlier this month</a> that arms supplies would be restricted unless 300 aid trucks entered Gaza a day. The UN said in mid-October that aid shipments to the embattled territory were at their lowest level in months.</p> <p>The Biden administration has complained of delays to US-funded aid at crossing points into Gaza and said the flow of supplies had dropped by more than 50% since last March when Israel promised to allow more deliveries.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UK government announced a \u00a32.26bn loan to Ukraine this week paid for with the interest accumulated on sanctioned Russian sovereign assets. It forms part of a commitment the UK made at the G7 summit in June.</p> <p>The Russian strikes on merchant vessels coincide with Ukraine\u2019s harvest season. Ukraine\u2019s food and grain exports, conducted largely via the Black Sea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/08/as-ukraine-reels-from-attacks-on-land-conflict-at-sea-signals-hope?CMP=share_btn_tw\">had recovered roughly to prewar levels this year</a> after Kyiv introduced a special shipping corridor along the western coast and forced the Russian surface fleet back with an audacious series of drone attacks.</p> <p>Before the war Ukraine was the world\u2019s seventh largest exporter of wheat, much of it bound for countries in the Middle East, the largest producer of sunflower oil and a supplier of other critical foodstuffs. But Russia has repeatedly tried to impose a maritime blockade to strangle Ukraine\u2019s economy.</p> <p>Starmer said Russia was \u201cintensifying attacks on areas of Ukraine that support the global south with much-needed food\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cRussia has no respect for the norms and laws that govern our international system,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cNot only was their illegal invasion a blatant attack on the principles of the UN charter, but the way they have executed their war in Ukraine shows no respect for human life, or the consequences of their invasion across the world.\u201d</p> <p>The UK government has announced that a British factory will start producing artillery barrels for Ukraine from 2027 as part of a wider agreement between the UK and Germany.</p> <p>The plant will be run by Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall, using steel from the UK supporting 400 jobs, and will be the first time artillery barrels have been made in the UK for a decade.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has accused Vladimir Putin of disrupting food supplies to Gaza after British intelligence suggested Russia had stepped up its attacks on Ukrainian ports. Starmer said it was clear the Russian president was \u201cwilling to gamble on global food security\u201d after several grain ships en route to developing countries were damaged by Russian strikes. Military intelligence published by the UK government overnight concluded that Russia had increased its attacks on Ukrainian port infrastructure in the Black Sea. Between 5 and 14 October at least four merchant vessels were struck by Russian munitions, according to the intelligence assessment. The strikes are believed to have delayed a vessel carrying vegetable oil destined for the World Food Programme in Palestine. Ships loaded with grain destined for Egypt, two vessels carrying corn and WFP shipments bound for southern Africa were also affected, in some cases as collateral damage in strikes on port infrastructure. \u201cRussia\u2019s indiscriminate strikes on ports in the Black Sea underscore that Putin is willing to gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission,\u201d the prime minister said in a statement. \u201cIn doing so, he is harming millions of vulnerable people across Africa, Asia and the Middle East, to try and gain the upper hand in his barbaric war.\u201d Starmer and Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, were urged at a meeting with British-Palestinian families on Tuesday to set up evacuation and resettlement schemes and take tougher measures against Israel\u2019s restrictions on aid entering Gaza. Health officials in the north of the Gaza Strip have warned they are running out of supplies to treat patients amid a renewed three-week-old Israeli offensive there. The Palestinian families called for a British personnel presence at border crossings in Gaza to ensure that inspections are carried out quickly and that aid flows unrestricted. Israel says aid has increased since the US government warned in a leaked letter earlier this month that arms supplies would be restricted unless 300 aid trucks entered Gaza a day. The UN said in mid-October that aid shipments to the embattled territory were at their lowest level in months. The Biden administration has complained of delays to US-funded aid at crossing points into Gaza and said the flow of supplies had dropped by more than 50% since last March when Israel promised to allow more deliveries. Meanwhile, the UK government announced a \u00a32.26bn loan to Ukraine this week paid for with the interest accumulated on sanctioned Russian sovereign assets. It forms part of a commitment the UK made at the G7 summit in June. The Russian strikes on merchant vessels coincide with Ukraine\u2019s harvest season. Ukraine\u2019s food and grain exports, conducted largely via the Black Sea, had recovered roughly to prewar levels this year after Kyiv introduced a special shipping corridor along the western coast and forced the Russian surface fleet back with an audacious series of drone attacks. Before the war Ukraine was the world\u2019s seventh largest exporter of wheat, much of it bound for countries in the Middle East, the largest producer of sunflower oil and a supplier of other critical foodstuffs. But Russia has repeatedly tried to impose a maritime blockade to strangle Ukraine\u2019s economy. Starmer said Russia was \u201cintensifying attacks on areas of Ukraine that support the global south with much-needed food\u201d. \u201cRussia has no respect for the norms and laws that govern our international system,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cNot only was their illegal invasion a blatant attack on the principles of the UN charter, but the way they have executed their war in Ukraine shows no respect for human life, or the consequences of their invasion across the world.\u201d The UK government has announced that a British factory will start producing artillery barrels for Ukraine from 2027 as part of a wider agreement between the UK and Germany. The plant will be run by Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall, using steel from the UK supporting 400 jobs, and will be the first time artillery barrels have been made in the UK for a decade.",

Mikel Arteta speaks to Amazon Prime. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the result \u2026 a win in the Champions League is always difficult and important \u2026 there were two different halves \u2026 the second half a bit of fatigue crept in \u2026 we played 65 minutes with ten men three days ago \u2026 it was a big task \u2026 we dug in and got the result \u2026 happy days \u2026 credit to Shakhtar, they\u2019re a good team \u2026 brave \u2026 when you lose the ball in the wrong areas you are going to suffer \u2026 Martinelli has been really good \u2026 he had a niggle with the national team \u2026 you could see he was fresh today \u2026 we haven\u2019t conceded much, but in those moments we needed David Raya \u2026 he is really connected with the team \u2026 Saka is unlikely [to play against Liverpool on Sunday] \u2026 Riccardo [Calafiori] felt something and had to come off \u2026 it is a bit of a worry.\u201d Player of the match Gabriel Martinelli speaks to Amazon Prime. \u201cWe wanted to score more \u2026 but we wanted to win the game and that is the most important thing \u2026 it was my goal! [smiles cheekily] \u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter if it was an own goal \u2026 the win is what is important and we are really happy \u2026. we have lost some players \u2026 it is tricky \u2026 but we know our qualities \u2026 we came here to win the game and we did it \u2026 we are lucky to have David Raya here and thank you for that save!\u201d \u2026 and so here\u2019s how the Champions League megasuperdupertable looks after tonight\u2019s round of fixtures. Niall McVeigh has all the details of the other matches in Clockwatch. (Please ignore the technical glitch at the bottom, which keeps drawing in Celtic\u2019s group-stage humiliation from last season, as though getting thumped 7-1 by Borussia Dortmund the other month wasn\u2019t bad enough. Rumours that our development team refer to themselves as The People are well wide of the mark.) Arsenal had the lion\u2019s share of possession, and created most of the chances. But in the end they needed an own goal \u2013 Dmytro Riznyk the unfortunate fall guy \u2013 to make the difference. The hosts missed several good opportunities to double their lead, plus a penalty, then toiled for the remainder of the second period. Any hopes of replacing a few big names and easing to the finishing line ahead of the Premier League clash with Liverpool were set aside; indeed David Raya was forced into action just before the end to deny Pedrinho. Shakhtar Donetsk, forever away from home, did themselves and Ukraine proud, putting in a staunch performance that should serve them well going forward, even if they\u2019re still to trouble the scoreboard operator in their Champions League campaign. Arsenal can content themselves with three points, and nobody need remember this night should they make it deep into the competition next spring. A win\u2019s a win\u2019s a win, ain\u2019t that the truth. 90 min +6: Pedro Henrique slides in hysterically on Havertz, who was thinking about taking the ball to the corner flag, but now wisely leaps out of the way. No contact, but Pedro Henrique deserves his booking nonetheless. 90 min +5: The clock ticks on, and it looks like Arsenal have done enough. Just. 90 min +4: Kryskiv dinks a cross in from the right. Gomes rises highest, six yards out, but can only flap a shoulder at the ball, which loops high before being claimed by Raya. Arsenal are hanging on. How did it come to this? 90 min +3: Shakhtar are pushing Arsenal back. Home nerves crackle around the stadium. 90 min +2: Shakhtar get a shot on target here all right. Pedrinho pearls a dipping screamer towards the bottom right from the edge of the box, and Raya is forced into full-stretch action to turn around the post. Nothing comes of the corner, but Arsenal hearts were in mouths there. 90 min +1: The first of six additional minutes is played out in the drama-free style. 90 min: A reverse of roles as Martinelli swings long from the left for Rice, who extends a leg to poke towards the bottom right. There\u2019s no pace on the redirection, and it\u2019s an easy snaffle for Riznyk. 89 min: A gift of a corner for Arsenal down the right. Rice sends it long. Konoplia heads clear under pressure from Martinelli. 88 min: Jorginho, who like Kai Havertz won this tournament with Chelsea in 2021, replaces Leandro Trossard. 87 min: Marlon Gomes comes on for Artem Bondarenko. 86 min: On the touchline, Mikel Arteta looks concerned. His team are labouring. 84 min: Eguinaldo makes way for Lassina Traor\u00e9. Then Martinelli is booked for flapping an arm across Konoplia\u2019s startled coupon. 83 min: Matviyenko romps into space down the left. He feeds Pedro Henrique on the overlap. Pedro Henrique\u2019s low cross is hit hard but nowhere near a team-mate, allowing Raya to parry clear. Fortunately for Arsenal, the rebound doesn\u2019t fall to a black-and-orange shirt. 82 min: Sudakov hoicks a wild shot over the bar from distance. The nerves at the Emirates are palpable. It should never have come to this. So much for a nice calm evening ahead of the incoming Sunday storm. 81 min: Another loose Arsenal pass allows Eguinaldo to launch a counter. But once again he hesitates, allowing the hosts to regroup, and eventually Pedrinho is forced to turn tail. 80 min: For the record, that was Arsenal\u2019s first penalty of the season. Last season, they converted all ten awarded. 79 min: Shakhtar go up the other end, Pedrinho and Bondarenkos shooting from the edge of a packed box. Both efforts are easily blocked, but Arsenal are making a nine-course tasting menu of this. They should be out of sight, but the visitors fancy their chances of snatching a shock equaliser now! 78 min: For a second, it looks as though VAR will dig Trossard out of a hole. A check to see if the keeper had moved off his line. But his back foot was still on the white stuff when Trossard made connection. The save\u2019s a good one! 77 min: Trossard misses the penalty! He slams the spot kick straight down the middle, but Riznyk, who had dived to his left, whips the ball away with a trailing leg! 76 min: Yep, it\u2019s a penalty. Bondar had his arm outstretched, away from his body, and there was plenty of time for him to get it out of the way. The referee points to the spot. Trossard to take. 75 min: Before the corner\u2019s taken, VAR takes a look at a potential handball. Seems Merino\u2019s cross pinged off Bondar\u2019s right arm. The ref\u2019s asked over to the screen. 74 min: Merino looks for Trossard with a low cross from the left. He doesn\u2019t find his man, but does earn a corner. Time for one of Arsenal\u2019s specialist routines? 73 min: Sterling and Havertz attempt to one-two their way down the right, but the move breaks down. Arsenal are making hard work of this. 72 min: Here comes the de-jewelled Lewis-Skelly. 71 min: Well, I say Lewis-Skelly comes on in his place. He\u2019s stopped by the fourth official and told to take off a dangling earring. He\u2019s not on yet. 70 min: Calafiori slipped while being brushed off the ball by Eguinaldo, and looks to have tweaked something. He goes down a couple of times, then Myles Lewis-Skelly comes on in his place. 69 min: Sterling gets involved immediately, only to dribble his way down a blind alley on the right. 68 min: Gabriel Jesus, now 23 games without a goal, is replaced by Raheem Sterling. 66 min: Eguinaldo brushes Calafiori off the ball with absurd ease, and suddenly they\u2019re three on two. But they dither and over-elaborate, and finally Pedrinho charges into Merino, and the whistle offers Arsenal relief. The home side have got really slack, and got away with a huge mistake there. A better, more confident team would have equalised. 65 min: Arsenal slow things down with some of the old sterile domination. 64 min: A double change by Donetsk, as Oleksandr Zubkov and Danylo Sikan make way for Pedrinho and the exotically named Kevin. 63 min: Zubkov jinks his way down the right and wins a corner of Martinelli. He takes it himself. It\u2019s easily cleared, but Arsenal are getting sloppy here. 61 min: Arsenal sit off, allowing Matviyenko to drive purposefully down the inside-left channel. The hosts are fortunate the Shakhtar captain\u2019s low cross is aimless. Arsenal have slipped into snooze mode, with the crowd\u2019s \u201cCome on Arsenal\u201d chant having little effect on their heroes. 59 min: Sudakov crosses low from the right. Zubkov attempts an elaborate flick when a bog-standard belt might have been more appropriate. Arsenal suddenly look a little ragged, and Mikel Arteta orders a few of his subs to warm up. 57 min: A careless misplaced pass by Merino on the edge of his own box is snaffled by Eguinaldo, who takes a whack goalwards. That might count as the third on-target effort of their campaign. It\u2019s deflected high into the air by Gabriel and Raya plucks the dropping ball from the sky. A stark reminder that for all Arsenal\u2019s dominance, and their constant chance creation, the hosts are still just the one goal up. 55 min: Trossard opens his legs to advance down the left channel before whistling a low drive inches wide of the left-hand post. The keeper had it covered. 54 min: Riznyk does much better here, parrying Martinelli\u2019s sweep from the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. The save leads to a corner. Nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 53 min: Riznyk, the ball at his feet, dithers and allows Martinelli to close him down. The keeper does just enough to retain possession and hoick out for a throw, but he\u2019s sailing close to the wind. Unlucky for the opener, but a goal there, and that would have been his fault. 51 min: Sudakov slips a clever ball down the inside-left channel for Zubkov, who turns to make space to shoot from the corner of the D. But Zubkov opts to roll a pass further down the channel in the hope of releasing Eguinaldo, and the ball trundles out for a goal kick. What a waste. Shakhtar\u2019s impotency writ large. 49 min: Another goal for Arsenal, and there\u2019s a fair chance Mikel Arteta might dip into his bench. Shakhtar aren\u2019t threatening to score one, never mind two, and there\u2019s that big game looming on Sunday. A chance to give some big names a rest may be grabbed with both hands. 47 min: Martinelli floats a deep cross in from the left. Trossard eyebrows it towards the far corner, but it\u2019s always heading wide. Havertz telescopes a leg but can\u2019t connect to poke home. Arsenal get the second half underway. Ben White, on a booking, is hooked in favour of Mikel Merino. Probably wise, given Arsenal\u2019s recent red-card woes, and the fact that White had also clipped Eguinaldo from behind and was probably chugging in the last-chance saloon. Half-time entertainment. Featuring Arsenal\u2019s first tentative steps in the post-Eidevall era. Dmytro Riznyk\u2019s unfortunate own goal is the difference \u2026 but Arsenal are well worth their lead. They\u2019ll doubtless think they should have had a couple more. 45 min: There will be one additional minute. 44 min: A basketball game suddenly breaks out. Jesus wins the ball on the edge of the Shakhtar D. He lays off to Trossard, who finds Havertz, who in turn flicks back to Jesus, down the right-hand channel. Jesus should score, breaking his 22-game drought, but his diagonal shot towards the bottom left is kicked away. The visitors break upfield, where Eguinaldo glides in from the left before ballooning a wild shot high and wide right. Shakhtar still on two on-target efforts for their Champions League campaign. But they\u2019re getting closer. Hey, it\u2019s all relative. 43 min: Arsenal continue to stroke it around in the patient style. They\u2019re in the lead, and in control, there\u2019s no need to push it. 41 min: There\u2019s a case to be made that Matviyenko\u2019s clearing kick was dangerously high, but you\u2019d need a heart of stone \u2026 or be an Arsenal supporter \u2026 to deny Shakhtar the benefit of the decision. It was great play all round. 39 min: Martinelli crosses deep from the left. Jesus heads it back across goal, teeing up Havertz, a couple of yards out and with the keeper out of position, having chased after the initial cross. Havertz is surely destined to score \u2026 and yet he doesn\u2019t, because Matviyenko hooks clear, taking the ball off the striker\u2019s eyebrow. What a last-ditch intervention! 38 min: A case in point: Sudakov advances down the right but there\u2019s only Sikan in the middle to aim a cross at, and he\u2019s surrounded by defenders. Sudakov swings it in anyway, and it\u2019s an easy catch for Raya. Still just the two efforts on target, then. 37 min: Shakhtar are playing pretty well. Some crisp passing, a strong press \u2026 but it all falls down in the final third, where they\u2019re achieving nothing. By all accounts, they\u2019ve only had two efforts on target in their entire Champions League campaign so far. 35 min: That aforementioned Rice cross on 32 minutes \u2026 I\u2019ve undersold Riznyk\u2019s involvement. The ball was deflected and the keeper still managed to sweep it clear with Havertz lurking. Good to see the own goal hasn\u2019t addled his head. 34 min: White goes into the book for a cynical tug on Eguinaldo\u2019s shoulder. 32 min: Arsenal\u2019s tails are up now. Rice crosses low from the left. Havertz can\u2019t connect to bundle home from close range. The visitors clear their lines. 31 min: Uefa had initially given that goal to Martinelli, but the decision was never likely to stand. It\u2019s the unfortunate Riznyk\u2019s all right. His team-mates make a point of geeing him up. He couldn\u2019t do much about it. Rice clips a pass down the left for Martinelli. He cuts into the box, twists Konoplia\u2019s blood, then pings a low shot off the base of the left-hand post. The ball rebounds onto Riznyk\u2019s back and in. Unlucky for the keeper, especially as Martinelli\u2019s initial shot took a little deflection en route. 28 min: Shakhtar captain Matviyenko launches a long pass down the inside-right in the hope of releasing Zubkov, but Calafiori is on point to clear. Arsenal then counter, and \u2026 27 min: Arsenal ping it around the back awhile. No rush. Trossard then tries to release Martinelli down the left with a diagonal rake. Goal kick all the way. 25 min: White clips Eguinaldo on the ankle. A bit clumsy. No booking, though, which is probably fair enough; it\u2019s hardly been that kind of game. 24 min: The Arsenal fans get shoooooooooot-happy again. This time it\u2019s Calafiori who\u2019s encouraged to take a pelt from distance; the defender sends a pea-roller into the grateful arms of Riznyk. 22 min: Martinelli makes good down the left and rolls infield for Trossard, who flicks wide left from the corner of the six-yard box. Arsenal are yet to put Riznyk in the Shakhtar goal to work. 21 min: Rice has a dig from the best part of 30 yards. Having taken a touch inside from the left, he swivels and drags a poor effort wide left. To be fair, he was only doing what the crowd wanted. \u201cShooooooooot.\u201d 20 min: Martinelli and Havertz take turns to scoop first-time passes down the inside-left channel. Trossard strides into the box only to screw a weak half-volley wide left of the target. 18 min: Eguinaldo and Sikan again combine, this time down the inside-right channel, and suddenly a game of head tennis breaks out on the edge of the Arsenal box. The hosts eventually clear, but this spell has put the Ukrainian fans in good voice. 16 min: Eguinaldo shimmies in from the left and exchanges passes with Sikan before shooting from the edge of the Arsenal box. His effort is deflected over the bar for a corner that comes to nothing, but there\u2019s a first dispatch across the Arsenal bow. Shakhtar may be underdogs, but they\u2019re not without teeth. 15 min: Both of these sides have a big domestic match on the horizon. Arsenal\u2019s upcoming set-to with Liverpool we already know about; the Ukrainian champions are away at league leaders Dynamo Kyiv this weekend. 13 min: Mykhailo Mudryk, formerly of Shakhtar and now a Chelsea player, is in the stand watching his old pals. Somewhere in the multiverse, he\u2019s on the pitch in an Arsenal shirt. It came close to happening before fate sent him to Stamford Bridge instead. 11 min: Jesus probes elegantly down the inside-right channel and a little bit of space opens up in front of him, but Kryskiv is wise to the developing situation, coming across to close it back down. Jesus falls over. 10 min: That\u2019s settled Shakhtar down after a slightly shaky start. The game simmers down and now it\u2019s Arsenal\u2019s turn to get patient. 8 min: Donetsk settle things down with some patient passing at the back. Arsenal are lulled into a false sense of security. White whiffs a simple backpass and allows Eguinaldo to race down the inside-left channel. Drifting infield, Eguinaldo has the opportunity to shoot from the edge of the D, but takes too many touches and the chance is soon gone. 6 min: Trossard swings it in, and Arsenal should be leading. The visitors are unable to clear their lines, and the ball drops to Calafiori, eight yards out. He\u2019s got enough time to fix himself, but leans back and shovels over the bar. What a chance. You\u2019d expect better from someone who scored such a pearler at Manchester City last month. 5 min: Trossard plays a cute reverse pass down the inside-right channel to release Havertz into the box. A corner is earned. Trossard, filling in for the absent Saka, swings it into the mixer. Kryskiv is forced to eyebrow over his own bar. Trossard to try again. 4 min: A few touches for Saliba, who might as well put in 110 percent tonight. He\u2019ll not be available at the weekend against Liverpool, with Arsenal today confirming they\u2019ll not appeal his red card against Bournemouth. Plenty of time to put the old feet up then. 2 min: Rice swings the corner under the bar. Riznyk slaps it away. Trossard recycles on the other flank with some neat skill, but his cross is too deep for his team-mates in the six-yard box. Still, a fast start by the hosts. 1 min: Martinelli tears down the left and wins the first corner of the game on 37 seconds. A determined run. Rice wanders over to take in front of 5,000 Ukrainian fans. Shakhtar get the ball rolling. A fine atmosphere at the Emirates. The teams are out. Arsenal in their red and white finery, Shakhtar sporting second-choice black with a spatter of orange. Once the Uefa marketing bods have done their usual number on George Frideric Handel, we\u2019ll all be good to go. \u201cHistory does indeed favour Arsenal if you take a long enough look backwards,\u201d agrees Charles Antaki, \u201cbut if very recent history is anything to go by, then unless Arteta has managed to choke off the supply of stupid pills that have been doing the rounds of the players, then we will see a parade of hilariously bad back passes, suicidal tackles, and an outbreak of ball-kicking-away. Just Say No.\u201d The two early games have finished. Milan have beaten Club Brugge 3-1, while Monaco have thumped 1991 champions Red Star Belgrade 5-1. All of which leaves the Big Table looking like this as Arsenal, Shakhtar and everyone else go into the 8pm kick-offs. (Please ignore the technical glitch at the bottom, which keeps drawing in Celtic\u2019s group-stage humiliation from last season, as though getting thumped 7-1 by Borussia Dortmund the other month wasn\u2019t bad enough. Rumours that our development team work with Penny Arcade blasting from the office stereo on loop are well wide of the mark.) Andriy Shevchenko, Dynamo Kyiv and Milan legend and now president of the Ukrainian Football Association, speaks to Amazon Prime. \u201cShakhtar represent Ukraine here \u2026 we have to thank the soldiers on the front line who allow us to play football \u2026 best of luck to Shakhtar who deserve to be in this competition \u2026 we have to develop football in Ukraine, even in these circumstances \u2026 I know the situation could change every day \u2026 but I defend my country and the rights of my country \u2026 grassroots \u2026 women\u2019s football \u2026 we are going to carry on and fight \u2026 Champions League is the greatest competition \u2026 Georgiy Sudakov has very good skills \u2026 an important player \u2026 big potential to become even better \u2026 he can cover different positions on the pitch \u2026 support Ukraine \u2026 the war is not finished \u2026 do what you can \u2026 during this time you know who your friends are and we want to thank the British people.\u201d Oleksandr Zinchenko is only a sub for Arsenal tonight. Nevertheless, this obviously remains a big night for the Ukrainian, who was unable to break through as a youth with Shakhtar, but hasn\u2019t done too badly for himself at Manchester City and Arsenal since. He discusses his career, and the difficulty of following the war back home from overseas, with Donald McRae. Mikel Arteta speaks to Amazon Prime. \u201cNo eye [on the upcoming match against Liverpool] \u2026 we had a great match against PSG and we\u2019re going to have another one \u2026 we are very excited about it \u2026 Saka was not able to do a session in the way we wanted \u2026 at the moment I am not very hopeful [that he will be available for the Liverpool game] \u2026 I give my players perspective \u2026 we have not lost a game in six months \u2026 now we have, let\u2019s have a reaction \u2026 we have options \u2026 in midfield and up front we have some good options \u2026 we have a lot of sympathy for Shakhtar \u2026 the difficult situation they have \u2026 we welcome them in the best possible manner \u2026 when it comes to the game we must do our best.\u201d Shakhtar were forced to move from their home town of Donetsk in 2014 due to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, a fact coach Marino Pu\u0161i\u0107 references while talking to Amazon Prime: \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2026 facing all these challenges make you stronger \u2026 we are not complaining \u2026 we are fighters \u2026 we came here to play \u2026 so let\u2019s play football \u2026 we had a short period to prepare ourselves \u2026 eight-and-a-half hours in the bus, then we travelled to here \u2026 every game is like an away game \u2026 we try to create a home feeling in Lviv but it\u2019s far from a home feeling \u2026 we have to create it for ourselves \u2026 it has to come out of us \u2026 we want to show up and compete \u2026 it does not matter whether we play Arsenal or Barcelona \u2026 we have a pretty young squad \u2026 improving every day \u2026 that\u2019s the pleasure of my job \u2026 our hotel was destroyed completely \u2026 it could have been us.\u201d Pu\u0161i\u0107 is also asked about his time working with new Liverpool boss Arne Slot while at AZ Alkmaar. \u201cWe enjoyed a lot of success \u2026 he is an amazing manager \u2026 I am very happy for him and I have no doubts about it \u2026 he is ready for everything \u2026 his tactical ability and individual approaches are excellent.\u201d This fixture, as mentioned in the preamble, has been played on two previous occasions. Here\u2019s what happened in 2010 \u2026 \u2026 and this is how things panned out in those sepia-toned days when MBMs were still very much in their infancy and as rare as a Martin Keown double, so it\u2019s a straight-up match report you\u2019re getting for this one. Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus return for Arsenal in the wake of their 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth. Mikel Merino and Raheem Sterling drop to the bench. Martin \u00d8degaard, Bukayo Saka and Jurri\u00ebn Timber remain on the injured list. Should Kai Havertz score tonight, he\u2019ll become the first player ever to score in eight consecutive games at the Emirates. Arsenal: Raya, White, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori, Rice, Partey, Trossard, Gabriel Jesus, Havertz, Martinelli. Subs: Neto, Setford, Kiwior, Zinchenko, Jorginho, Merino, Sterling, Butler-Oyedeji, Lewis-Skelly, Nwaneri, Robinson, Monlouis. Shakhtar Donetsk: Riznyk, Konoplya, Bondar, Matviyenko, Pereira Pedrinho, Kryskiv, Zubkov, Bondarenko, Sudakov, Eguinaldo, Sikan. Subs: Fesyun, Traore, Franjic, Stepanenko, Shved, Azarovi, Augusto, Ghram, Marlon Gomes, Kevin, da Silva Pedrinho, Newerton. Referee: Benoit Bastien (France). History strongly favours Arsenal tonight. The Gunners have twice before welcomed Shakhtar Donetsk to their manor; they\u2019ve put the hurt on the Ukrainians on both occasions, 3-2 in 2000, 5-1 in 2010. Shakhtar have never won in England in seven attempts, avoiding defeat just the once, against a coasting Manchester City in 2019. Shakhtar haven\u2019t scored in this season\u2019s Champions League yet; Arsenal haven\u2019t let one in yet. So all signs point to yes. But then few expected Bournemouth to turn Arsenal over last weekend, inflicting a first defeat of the season on Mikel Arteta\u2019s side, so you never know. Kick-off at the Emirates is at 8pm BST. It\u2019s on.",

The Italians are back at Europe\u2019s top table for the first time since 1965 \u2013 making Villa look like precocious upstarts in comparison \u2013 but have made a slow start to the season after their former manager, Thiago Motta, hightailed it to Juve this summer.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong>Real Madrid</strong> need to shake off the indignity of a 1-0 defeat to Lille last time out, and will take on <strong>Dortmund</strong> in a rerun of last season\u2019s Wembley finale. Will it end in similar fashion tonight, with the side currently top of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague/table\">the leviathan Champions League table</a> carving out several chances before conceding late on? Probably.</p> <p>In their post-Mbapp\u00e9 era, <strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong> are still flying in Ligue 1 but have made an indifferent start in Europe, getting lucky against Girona before a meek surrender against Arsenal last time. Tonight, they host <strong>PSV</strong> in the PS Derby. The Dutch champions have won nine from nine in the Eredivisie this season, but continue to underwhelm in the Champions League.</p> <p>And we still haven\u2019t mentioned Arsenal v Shakhtar (which you can follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/oct/22/arsenal-v-shakhtar-donetsk-champions-league-live-score-updates\">over here</a>), <strong>Juventus</strong> seeking a third straight win against <strong>Stuttgart</strong>, R\u00faben Amorim\u2019s <strong>Sporting</strong> swashbucklers taking on <strong>Sturm Graz</strong>, or, er, <strong>Girona v Slovan Bratislava</strong>.

And against Juventus! In Turin! That\u2019s a heck of a way to return to the top table.\u201d While Nick Ames was at the Emirates for Arsenal\u2019s win \u2026 Here\u2019s Ben Fisher\u2019s verdict from a rocking Villa Park \u2026 League One results: Barnsley 2-2 Charlton, Birmingham 2-0 Bolton, Bristol Rovers 1-0 Shrewsbury, Burton 2-3 Wycombe, Crawley 3-0 Lincoln, Exeter 1-2 Reading, Leyton Orient 1-0 Rotherham, Peterborough 5-1 Blackpool, Stevenage 0-2 Cambridge, Stockport 1-1 Northampton, Wigan 1-2 Mansfield, Wrexham 0-0 Huddersfield. League Two results: Barrow 1-1 Notts County, Cheltenham 1-1 Bradford, Chesterfield 1-1 Colchester, Doncaster 0-1 Bromley, Fleetwood 0-1 Crewe, Gillingham 0-2 Newport, Harrogate 0-1 Port Vale, MK Dons 2-1 Accrington, Salford 2-1 Swindon, Tranmere 0-1 Grimsby, Walsall 3-1 Carlisle, Wimbledon 3-0 Morecambe. Let\u2019s catch up with tonight\u2019s Football League results, starting with the Championship \u2026 Cardiff 2-0 Portsmouth Leeds 2-1 Watford Oxford 1-1 Derby Preston 2-2 Norwich Sheffield Wed 0-0 Swansea Stoke 2-2 Bristol City QPR 1-1 Coventry And finally \u2026 Girona get their first-ever Champions League win thanks to goals from defenders Miguel and Juanpe. Viktor Gy\u00f6keres\u2019 solo run and finish caps another impressive European display for Sporting, who have seven points from three games. Stuttgart seal a deserved win in stoppage time after seeing a first goal ruled out for VAR and a penalty saved. Juventus were distinctly second best. The Gunners get it done despite Leandro Trossard\u2019s missed penalty \u2013 and not a red card in sight. No last-minute reprieve for PSG as Benitez makes a fine save and the ball is hooked off the line. PSV hold on for a point, and the final whistle is met by boos at Parc des Princes. Dortmund led 2-0 at half-time but were blown away by the hosts\u2019 comeback, with Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior hitting a hat-trick as Real Madrid reminded everyone who\u2019s in charge. Aston Villa, they\u2019re top of the league. Goals from McGinn and Dur\u00e1n steer the hosts through a tough battle, and they have three wins from three. No penalty! Marco Asensio went down in a heap, and the referee pointed to the spot \u2013 but after looking at a replay, it\u2019s overturned due to a lack of contact. Although there did appear to be some contact \u2026 Ballon d\u2019Or?! Vin\u00edcius completes his hat-trick in emphatic style, firing into the roof of the net. And in Paris \u2026 a penalty to the hosts \u2026 El Bilal Tour\u00e9 has surely won it for Stuttgart! A lovely first touch, and he fires beyond Perin. That\u2019s set to be the shock of the night \u2026 \u201cPSG v PSV is one of the most finely balanced matchups I can think of,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cThe Postscript Derby?\u201d It might live up to the billing, if either team can find a winner in stoppage time. Vin\u00edcius puts icing, cherry and a festive bow on the comeback, drilling the ball home after a surge upfield and dispensing with his shirt before piling into the home fans. Ballon d\u2019Or, Ballon d\u2019Or? Missed penalty! It was awarded for a foul by Danilo, who is shown a second yellow card for his troubles. Millot steps up \u2026 but Perin gets low to his right and saves! Juve survive again \u2013 while in Girona, Stuani also sees his penalty saved and it stays 2-0 to the hosts. Honestly, the only surprise here is the goalscorer \u2013 it\u2019s Lucas V\u00e1zquez, Real\u2019s backup right-back, who smashes home from a tight angle. Comeback complete \u2026 Penalty to Stuttgart! After a long VAR check \u2013 for what, I do not know \u2013 the referee heads to Monitor Town, and quickly awards the visitors a late penalty! Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 shoots from a narrow angle, but he is denied by Kobel \u2013 then at the other end, Courtois saves from Brandt as Dortmund threaten to retake the lead. Worth pointing out that if Villa see this out, they will have nine points \u2013 probably enough to qualify for the next round already. But Unai Emery will surely have an eye on securing a top-eight finish from here. Arsenal penalty saved! Leandro Trossard has the chance to seal victory from the spot \u2026 but he\u2019s denied by the Shakhtar keeper. Arsenal struggling to put this game to bed \u2026 Centre-half Juanpe steps up for a free kick, and sends the ball spinning into the top corner via a deflection. Girona\u2019s first Champions League win is in sight now. Here\u2019s the Dur\u00e1n goal. The striker was taken off for Ollie Watkins straight afterwards, and he wasn\u2019t too happy with the decision. With Dortmund pegged back in Madrid, Aston Villa are now top of the Champions League mega-table! Speaking of quickfire doubles \u2026 Villa lead 2-0! Morgan Rogers curls in an excellent cross towards Jhon Dur\u00e1n, who gets an instinctive touch to flick the ball into the far corner. That didn\u2019t take long \u2013 Mbapp\u00e9 is played in on goal and while he\u2019s denied a shot by a fine tackle, the ball rolls across goal for Vin\u00edcius to sweep into an empty net. Mbapp\u00e9 flagged offside, but VAR overturns as he was clearly onside when the pass was played. Real Madrid have been going full-throttle since the second half began, and they pull one back as Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s cross is headed home by Antonio R\u00fcdiger! Achraf Hakimi drills a shot from 25 yards out which zips through Walter Benitez\u2019s legs and into the net! Struggling to remember a keeper being nutmegged from that far out, but correct me if I\u2019m wrong. John McGinn with a free kick in front of the Holte End \u2026 he swings it in with his left foot, and it clears everybody, bounces once, and nestles in the far corner! It\u2019s checked by VAR for a brush off Ross Barkley\u2019s arm, but the goal stands. An outrageous solo effort from Viktor Gy\u00f6keres, who picks the ball up on the left flank, bustles inside beyond one marker, then keeps going sideways, past the keeper and another defender, before slotting into the bottom corner. Leon Bailey goes close for Villa, turning his low shot just wide of the far post. That\u2019s probably the closest the hosts have come in a tricky encounter so far. A goal in Turin \u2013 and it\u2019s Stuttgart who get it, Deniz Undav firing home at the near post via a deflection. But wait \u2026 it\u2019s been disallowed for handball! It\u2019s hard to tell, even on second or third viewing, which side of the \u201cT-shirt line\u201d the ball struck as Undav brought it down. \u201cStuttgart played excellently against Real Madrid, but it felt all the time as if Los Blancos would do what they always do, i.e. enough to win,\u201d writes Kari Tulinius. \u201cBut Juventus feel like they\u2019re there for the taking. Mittelstadt and Leweling have had the freedom of the left side, while Undav and Millot look menacing. Juventus had a free-kick in a decentish position, but have otherwise looked overwhelmed. And they\u2019re the home team!\u201d I do hope you haven\u2019t just jinxed it, Kari \u2026 Arsenal 1-0 Shakhtar Aston Villa 0-0 Bologna Girona 1-0 Slovan Bratislava Juventus 0-0 Stuttgart PSG 0-1 PSV Eindhoven Real Madrid 0-2 Dortmund Sturm Graz 0-1 Sporting All going according to plan for the Gunners so far \u2013 they lead at the break through an own goal. Most of said drama could be found at the Bernab\u00e9u, where the visitors struck twice in quick succession to leave Real Madrid at risk of a second-straight defeat. There\u2019s been more drama elsewhere, but Bologna have had the better chances in a goalless first half. Lee Kang-in almost punishes some loose PSV defending, but Benitez gets down well to save his shot. And that\u2019s half time. On a separate note, I like this PSV away kit \u2013 it looks like a Bury or Tranmere shirt from the mid-90s. A breakthrough for the debutants just before half time, with full-back Miguel Guti\u00e9rrez turning home Arnaut Danjuma\u2019s cross. League One half-times: Barnsley 1-0 Charlton, Birmingham 1-0 Bolton, Bristol Rovers 0-0 Shrewsbury, Burton 1-0 Wycombe, Crawley 0-0 Lincoln, Exeter 0-2 Reading, Leyton Orient 0-0 Rotherham, Peterborough 3-1 Blackpool, Stevenage 0-1 Cambridge, Stockport 0-0 Northampton, Wigan 0-1 Mansfield, Wrexham 0-0 Huddersfield. League Two half-times: Barrow 1-0 Notts County, Cheltenham 1-1 Bradford, Chesterfield 0-1 Colchester, Doncaster 0-1 Bromley, Fleetwood 0-0 Crewe, Gillingham 0-2 Newport, Harrogate 0-0 Port Vale, MK Dons 1-0 Accrington, Salford 1-0 Swindon, Wimbledon 0-0 Morecambe. The eternal champions do hit the woodwork twice in quick succession through Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham \u2013 but at the other end, Julian Brandt brings a flying save from Courtois to stop Dortmund making it 3-0. Woof. Dortmund double their lead at the Bernab\u00e9u, with Malen sweeping the ball across goal for Jamie Gittens to smash home at the far post. Real Madrid in more than a spot of bother \u2026 Another surprise scoreline, as Noa Lang drills the ball inside the near post, leaving Donnarumma on his heels! Championship half-times: Cardiff 2-0 Portsmouth, Leeds 2-0 Watford, Oxford 1-0 Derby, Preston 2-1 Norwich, Sheffield Wed 0-0 Swansea, Stoke 2-0 Bristol City, QPR 0-1 Coventry (latest \u2013 8pm kick-off). An unfortunate goalie-own-goal at the Emirates. Oh, hello. They couldn\u2019t score against Real at Wembley, but Dortmund deservedly lead tonight. It\u2019s Donyell Malen who scores, set up by a beautiful drag-back from Guirassy that takes out two Real Madrid defenders. Stuttgart hit the post! As they did against Real Madrid, the German side are testing Juventus \u2013 and Enzo Millot sees his shot beat Perin but rebound off the near post and away. We\u2019ve also been hearing that visiting fans are chanting in Italian \u2013 there\u2019s a big Italian community in Stuttgart, apparently. The more you know. If Pep Guardiola does move on at the end of the season, Sporting\u2019s R\u00faben Amorim is a big contender to replace him at Manchester City \u2013 especially with Hugo Viana, Sporting\u2019s director of football, heading to the Etihad. City have also been linked with Xabi Alonso \u2013 but I suppose it\u2019s all moot if Pep wants to stick around. We have a goal! The first of the night, 24 minutes in \u2013 and it\u2019s Nuno Santos for Sporting, hooking it in at the far post after a nice passing move (and a miss from hot-shot Viktor Gyokeres). Another chance for Bologna, where Orsolini is very close to turning Dillinja\u2019s cross in \u2013 although he\u2019s penalised for (I think) a foul on Maatsen. At the other end, Orsolini is booked for a clumsy foul, and now Villa have a dangerous free kick, right on the edge of the area \u2026 Tielemans slips a sideways pass to Maatsen, whose cross is cleared for a corner. PSG\u2019s front three tonight is Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bradley Barcola and Lee Kang-in \u2013 a talented trio, but a long way from the MSN days. Lee comes close to opening the scoring, but his shot is well saved by Benitez, and moments later Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 rattles the bar from close range. Aston Villa are trying to get something going in attack, with Bologna clearing away a couple of set pieces in quick succession. In Madrid, Vinicius fails to make enough contact with an acrobatic far-post effort. A chance for the hosts in Paris, with Bradley Barcola firing a low effort wide of the far post. No goals in any of the seven 8pm kick-offs so far. Boo! Bologna go closer here, with Thijs Dallinga pouncing on a through pass and testing Mart\u00ednez from a tight angle. At the Bernab\u00e9u, the first sniff of a chance falls for Dortmund, with Guirassy unable to get any power on his header from Brandt\u2019s cross. An early half-chance for Bologna, with Kacper Urbanski sending his shot well wide from just outside the area. A quick Championship update: Leeds have raced into a 2-0 lead at home to Watford, with Cardiff, Preston and Stoke leading Portsmouth, Norwich and Bristol City (respectively) by the same score. Elsewhere, Oxford lead Derby 1-0 in a battle between promoted sides. And not forgetting North London \u2026 We\u2019re about to kick off in Birmingham \u2013 where Villa fans have just unfurled a spectacular lion-based tifo \u2013 plus Turin, Paris, Madrid, Girona and Graz. It\u2019s on! Full time in the early games: it finished Milan 3-1 Club Brugge, and Monaco 5-1 Red Star Belgrade. That means Monaco are top of the big Champions League table, although probably not for long. Back at San Siro, 16-year-old Francesco Camarda sends a header looping over the keeper, and is mobbed by his teammates, who lift him in the air. But wait, here comes VAR to spoil everyone\u2019s fun \u2013 it\u2019s chalked off for a marginal offside. It stays Milan 3-1 Club Brugge. \u201cHei from Norway,\u201d writes Brendan Large. \u201cI can\u2019t be the only one thinking this new format has lead to hell of a lot of drubbings. Maybe the big teams play each other a bit more often, but the goal tallies being racked up in some games are not what anyone wants surely?\u201d Very true \u2013 it\u2019s perhaps been overlooked thanks to a couple of surprise results, but we\u2019ve already seen Bayern win 9-2 and Dortmund smash poor Celtic 7-1. It could get ugly in January if goal difference is needed for any of the big boys to secure a top-eight spot. Juventus (4-3-3): Perin; Savona, Kalulu, Danilo (c), Cabal; Fagioli, McKennie, Douglas Luiz; Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Vlahovic., Yildiz. Subs: Pinsoglio, Daffara, Gatti, Locatelli, Adzic, Thuram, Weah, Cambiaso, Rouhi, Mbangula. Stuttgart (4-2-3-1): N\u00fcbel; Vagnoman, Rouault, Chabot, Mittelstadt; Karazor (c), Stiller; Millot, Undav, Leweling; Demirovic. Subs: Bredlow, Seimen, Al Dakhil, Keitel, Toure, Kratzig, Stenzel, Rieder, Chase, Jarzinho. Reijnders strikes again, and Milan lead Club Brugge 3-1! A redemption arc almost complete for the midfielder, who was sent off against Udinese in Serie A this weekend. Now striker Francesco Camarda is coming on for his Champions League debut \u2013 he\u2019s 16 years old, and becomes Milan\u2019s youngest-ever player in the competition. And Monaco do now lead Red Star 4-1: it\u2019s Minamino with his second goal, set up by Embolo. There are also a stack of games in the Football League tonight \u2013 our main focus is on Europe but I\u2019ll endeavour to keep you updated. The Championship fixtures are as follows: Cardiff v Portsmouth, Leeds v Watford, Oxford v Derby, Preston v Norwich, QPR v Coventry, Sheffield Wednesday v Swansea, Stoke v Bristol City. Aston Villa (4-2-3-1): Mart\u00ednez; Konsa, Diego Carlos, Torres, Maatsen; Onana, Tielemans; Bailey, Rogers, McGinn (c); Dur\u00e1n. Subs: Olsen, Cash, Mings, Barkley, Buend\u00eda, Watkins, Digne, Philogene-Bidace, Nedeljkovic, Bogarde, Ramsey, Kamara. Bologna (4-3-3): Skorupski; Posch, Beukema (c), Lucumi, Lykogiannis; Fabbian, Freuler, Urbanski; Orsolini, Dallinga, Ndoye. Subs: Bagnolini, Ravaglia, Holm, Moro, Castro, Iling-Junior, Casale, Corazza, Pobega, Odgaard, Miranda. Don\u2019t forget, you can follow Arsenal v Shakhtar with Scott Murray here: And here\u2019s an excellent and timely interview with Arsenal\u2019s Ukrainian star, Oleksandr Zinchenko: Milan had been pegged back by 10-man Club Brugge, and Daniel Fonseca\u2019s decision to withdraw Rafael Le\u00e3o was greeted with whistles. But the man who replaced him \u2013 Noah Okofor \u2013 immediately sets up Tijjani Reijnders to restore the hosts\u2019 lead! Nothing so dramatic happening in Monaco, where the hosts now lead 3-1. Wilfried Singo scored the third goal, with Breel Embolo then scoring his second \u2013 which was subsequently disallowed for handball. Paris Saint-Germain (4-3-3): Donnarumma; Hakimi, Marquinhos (c), Pacho, Nuno Mendes; Za\u00efre-Emery, Jo\u00e3o Neves, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz; Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Lee, Barcola. Subs: Safonov, Tenas, Asensio, Dou\u00e9, Vitinha, Muani, Mayulu, Lucas Beraldo, Skriniar, Zague. PSV Eindhoven (4-3-3): Ben\u00edtez, Mauro J\u00fanior, Flamingo, Boscagli, Dams; Til, Tillman, Saibari; Bakayoko, Luuk de Jong (c), Lang. Subs: Drommel, Schiks, Obispo, Pepi, Driouech, Babadi, Land, Oppegard, Ledezma, Nagalo. Here\u2019s the Aston Villa team sheet \u2013 and Jhon Dur\u00e1n starts in place of Ollie Watkins. There are three other changes from the win at Fulham \u2013 Ian Maatsen and Ezri Konsa replace Lucas Digne and Matty Cash in defence, with John McGinn in for Jacob Ramsey in midfield. Real Madrid (4-3-3): Courtois; Lucas V\u00e1zquez, \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, R\u00fcdiger, Mendy; Valverde, Modric (c), Bellingham; Rodrygo, Mbapp\u00e9, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior. Subs: Lunin, Gonz\u00e1lez, Camavinga, Tchouam\u00e9ni, Arda G\u00fcler, Endrick, Jes\u00fas Vallejo, Ceballos, Fran Garc\u00eda. Borussia Dortmund (4-2-3-1): Kobel; Ryerson, S\u00fcle, Schlotterbeck, Bensebaini; Sabitzer, Nmecha; Gittens, Brandt (c), Malen; Guirassy. Subs: Meyer, Laurenz Lotka, Anton, Gro\u00df, Beier, Can, Campbell, Watjen, Mane, Kabar, Azhil. Half time in the early kick-offs, each pitting a former European Cup winner against a previous finalist. At San Siro, it\u2019s Milan 1-0 Club Brugge, Christian Pulisic scoring directly from a corner after Raphael Onyedika was sent off for the visitors. Elsewhere, Monaco lead Crvena Zvezda/Red Star Belgrade 2-1, with Takumi Minamino and Breel Embolo on target for the hosts on either side of Cherif Ndiaye\u2019s penalty for the Serbian side. The jury\u2019s still out on the new Champions League format, but the last round of games did deliver drama and upsets, with two of Europe\u2019s biggest beasts cut down to size. Aston Villa repeated their 1-0 European Cup final win over Bayern Munich, with Jhon \u201cDuran\u201d Dur\u00e1n bringing the 80s vibes back to Villa Park. Unai Emery\u2019s side have an opportunity to make it three wins from three at home to Bologna tonight. The Italians are back at Europe\u2019s top table for the first time since 1965 \u2013 making Villa look like precocious upstarts in comparison \u2013 but have made a slow start to the season after their former manager, Thiago Motta, hightailed it to Juve this summer. Elsewhere, Real Madrid need to shake off the indignity of a 1-0 defeat to Lille last time out, and will take on Dortmund in a rerun of last season\u2019s Wembley finale. Will it end in similar fashion tonight, with the side currently top of the leviathan Champions League table carving out several chances before conceding late on? Probably. In their post-Mbapp\u00e9 era, Paris Saint-Germain are still flying in Ligue 1 but have made an indifferent start in Europe, getting lucky against Girona before a meek surrender against Arsenal last time. Tonight, they host PSV in the PS Derby. The Dutch champions have won nine from nine in the Eredivisie this season, but continue to underwhelm in the Champions League. And we still haven\u2019t mentioned Arsenal v Shakhtar (which you can follow over here), Juventus seeking a third straight win against Stuttgart, R\u00faben Amorim\u2019s Sporting swashbucklers taking on Sturm Graz, or, er, Girona v Slovan Bratislava. Yowza!",

      "body": "<p>As this new, distended \u00adChampions League format entered its mean\u00addering middle stage it had been tempting to wonder exactly what was at stake for Arsenal. They did not exactly put anyone straight with&nbsp;a&nbsp;bland, low-key performance but the night produced what they had come for. </p> \n<p>Even if their European hopes were never going to live or die by this result, Arsenal moved a giant step towards continuing their campaign beyond January.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/22/aston-villa-bologna-champions-league-match-report\">Aston Villa keep up perfect start after McGinn and Dur\u00e1n polish off Bologna</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Win the next two or three, and perhaps Mikel Arteta might be tempted to spare some of his side\u2019s wearier legs the league phase denouement.

Shakhtar Donetsk were on the ropes at times during the first half and could have been further behind than the sole, unfortunate own goal credited to their goalkeeper Dmytro Riznyk.</p> \n<p>They are redoubtable competitors at this level, a continuing marvel given the horrors that continue to unfold back home, and hung in there sufficiently to have a genuine sniff of glory by the end. Riznyk\u2019s save from a Leandro Trossard penalty infused the finale with some tension and his opposite number, David Raya, was called upon to ensure the picture did&nbsp;not transform.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e6c2c553-4f74-412f-aef9-8e87710c3abb\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Juventus</b> suffered a 1-0 defeat by&nbsp;<b>Stuttgart</b> after a dramatic conclusion at the Allianz Stadium.&nbsp;A foul by Danilo on Anthony Rouault led to the Juve man being sent off and the visitors being awarded an 86th-minute penalty, which went unconverted as Enzo Millot's effort was saved by Mattia Perin, before El Bilal Tour\u00e9 secured victory for the Bundesliga side in stoppage time.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Paris Saint-Germain</b> drew 1-1 at home with <b>PSV Eindhoven</b>, Achraf Hakimi's effort for the French champions cancelling out Noa Lang's opener.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Milan</b> saw off 10-man <b>Club Brugge</b> 3-1 at the San Siro, with Tijjani Reijnders notching a brace.

Arsenal set out quickly as usual, presumably keen to earn a more sedate second period. There was always the risk for Shakhtar that, even with Martin \u00d8degaard and Bukayo Saka still missing, the game might be put beyond them if their hosts turned up the throttle.</p> \n<p>Calafiori missed a glorious early chance, leaning back and spooning over from eight yards after Trossard\u2019s corner had fallen to him, and at that point Shakhtar were barely w\u00adeathering a storm. But they settled sufficiently to quieten an already semi-engaged crowd, most of the noise coming from a 3,000-strong away contingent that bounced in the&nbsp;autumn air and chanted support for Ukraine\u2019s army, and appeared to have secured a foothold before the deciding goal arrived.</p> \n<p>There was luck in the \u00adoutcome but also reward for Gabriel \u00adMartinelli, who was Arsenal\u2019s liveliest performer by some distance and is showing signs of a return to his \u00adirrepressible best. The Brazilian took a Declan Rice pass out on his left\u2011sided perch and, via a \u00adcharacteristic jink inside the right\u2011back Yukhym \u00adKonoplia, his drilled shot struck the base of the near post. It rebounded off the unwitting Riznyk and squirmed in, enlivening a game that was falling flat.</p> \n<p>Riznyk set about the rest of the evening as if looking to set the record straight. He was sharp to clear ahead of Kai Havertz as Arsenal sought a quick second and then, just before the interval, saved smartly from Gabriel Jesus. There was also cause to thank Mykola Matviyenko, his \u00adcentre-back, for a miraculous intervention to \u00adprevent Havertz con\u00adverting from almost on the line.</p> \n<p>The biggest conundrum for Arteta, based on the first 45 minutes, lay in Ben White-shaped form. White had been forced to recover at haste early on after the left\u2011winger Eguinaldo picked his pocket and was later booked. \u201cWe\u2019ve played enough with 10 men,\u201d Arteta noted \u00adafterwards with reference to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/bournemouth-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">spate of domestic red cards</a>, so White was spared the remainder and Mikel Merino entered&nbsp;the scene.</p> \n<p>Trossard glanced beyond the far post but, beyond a first-time \u00adMartinelli effort that Riznyk repelled, Arsenal\u2019s creative juices ran dry after re-emerging. Shakhtar, no mugs when given the chance to construct, were handed a presentable opening by a sloppy pass from Trossard that demanded a potentially goal-saving block by Gabriel from Eguinaldo. </p> \n<p>They were still in the game and Arsenal already looked skittish, at least to the extent this occasion could make them so, when \u00adCalafiori pulled up and was withdrawn after an unsuccessful attempt to run the&nbsp;\u00adproblem off.</p> \n<p>Shortly afterwards Valeriy Bondar was adjudged, following a VAR review, to have turned Merino\u2019s cross away with an outstretched arm. Trossard was charged with making sure but Riznyk achieved a deserved measure of redemption by repelling a poor spot-kick, aimed down the \u00admiddle, with a trailing leg.</p> \n<p>Now Shakhtar were visibly alive with possibility, their probing finally yielding a mightily close thing in added time. Pedrinho thought that he had caught Raya out from range but was thwarted by a full\u2011stretch stop that saved Arsenal any material&nbsp;anguish. </p> \n<p>Shakhtar, whose 20-hour journey back to Kyiv for the weekend derby with Dynamo speaks amply of the extraordinary lengths they reach in order to play, could feel proud. For Arsenal, this was another stint on the treadmill to tick off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As this new, distended Champions League format entered its meandering middle stage it had been tempting to wonder exactly what was at stake for Arsenal. They did not exactly put anyone straight with a bland, low-key performance but the night produced what they had come for. Even if their European hopes were never going to live or die by this result, Arsenal moved a giant step towards continuing their campaign beyond January. Win the next two or three, and perhaps Mikel Arteta might be tempted to spare some of his side\u2019s wearier legs the league phase denouement. That might be carrot enough given the sight, 20 minutes from full-time, of a clearly pained Riccardo Calafiori leaving the field here. Arsenal could do without further injuries to key players and, if Calafiori is forced to miss the visit of Liverpool on Sunday, their manager might curse such an inconsequential midweek assignment. That is a comment on the competition itself, not Arsenal\u2019s opponents. Shakhtar Donetsk were on the ropes at times during the first half and could have been further behind than the sole, unfortunate own goal credited to their goalkeeper Dmytro Riznyk. They are redoubtable competitors at this level, a continuing marvel given the horrors that continue to unfold back home, and hung in there sufficiently to have a genuine sniff of glory by the end. Riznyk\u2019s save from a Leandro Trossard penalty infused the finale with some tension and his opposite number, David Raya, was called upon to ensure the picture did not transform. Arteta identified fatigue in his players afterwards, which would explain a performance of two different speeds. Arsenal set out quickly as usual, presumably keen to earn a more sedate second period. There was always the risk for Shakhtar that, even with Martin \u00d8degaard and Bukayo Saka still missing, the game might be put beyond them if their hosts turned up the throttle. Calafiori missed a glorious early chance, leaning back and spooning over from eight yards after Trossard\u2019s corner had fallen to him, and at that point Shakhtar were barely weathering a storm. But they settled sufficiently to quieten an already semi-engaged crowd, most of the noise coming from a 3,000-strong away contingent that bounced in the autumn air and chanted support for Ukraine\u2019s army, and appeared to have secured a foothold before the deciding goal arrived. There was luck in the outcome but also reward for Gabriel Martinelli, who was Arsenal\u2019s liveliest performer by some distance and is showing signs of a return to his irrepressible best. The Brazilian took a Declan Rice pass out on his left\u2011sided perch and, via a characteristic jink inside the right\u2011back Yukhym Konoplia, his drilled shot struck the base of the near post. It rebounded off the unwitting Riznyk and squirmed in, enlivening a game that was falling flat. Riznyk set about the rest of the evening as if looking to set the record straight. He was sharp to clear ahead of Kai Havertz as Arsenal sought a quick second and then, just before the interval, saved smartly from Gabriel Jesus. There was also cause to thank Mykola Matviyenko, his centre-back, for a miraculous intervention to prevent Havertz converting from almost on the line. The biggest conundrum for Arteta, based on the first 45 minutes, lay in Ben White-shaped form. White had been forced to recover at haste early on after the left\u2011winger Eguinaldo picked his pocket and was later booked. \u201cWe\u2019ve played enough with 10 men,\u201d Arteta noted afterwards with reference to their spate of domestic red cards, so White was spared the remainder and Mikel Merino entered the scene. Trossard glanced beyond the far post but, beyond a first-time Martinelli effort that Riznyk repelled, Arsenal\u2019s creative juices ran dry after re-emerging. Shakhtar, no mugs when given the chance to construct, were handed a presentable opening by a sloppy pass from Trossard that demanded a potentially goal-saving block by Gabriel from Eguinaldo. They were still in the game and Arsenal already looked skittish, at least to the extent this occasion could make them so, when Calafiori pulled up and was withdrawn after an unsuccessful attempt to run the problem off. Shortly afterwards Valeriy Bondar was adjudged, following a VAR review, to have turned Merino\u2019s cross away with an outstretched arm. Trossard was charged with making sure but Riznyk achieved a deserved measure of redemption by repelling a poor spot-kick, aimed down the middle, with a trailing leg. Now Shakhtar were visibly alive with possibility, their probing finally yielding a mightily close thing in added time. Pedrinho thought that he had caught Raya out from range but was thwarted by a full\u2011stretch stop that saved Arsenal any material anguish. Shakhtar, whose 20-hour journey back to Kyiv for the weekend derby with Dynamo speaks amply of the extraordinary lengths they reach in order to play, could feel proud. For Arsenal, this was another stint on the treadmill to tick off.",

      "bodyText": "Water companies in England could be banned from making a profit under plans for a complete overhaul of the system. The idea is one of the options being considered by a new commission set up by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) amid public fury over the way firms have prioritised profit over the environment. Sources at the department said they would consider forcing the sale of water companies in England to firms that would run them as not-for-profits. Unlike under nationalisation, the company would not be run by the government but by a private company, run for public benefit. The nonprofit model, which is widely used in other European countries, allows staff to be paid substantial salaries and bonuses but any profits on top of that are returned to the company. Welsh Water, which runs under this model, has no shareholders and any surplus money is reinvested back into the business or into customer services. Since Welsh Water was bought in 2001 it has reduced its debt substantially; its ratio of debt to equity has dropped from 93% to 58% since not-for-profit Glas Cymru acquired the company with debts of \u00a31.85bn. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, said: \u201cOur waterways are polluted and our water system urgently needs fixing. That is why today we have launched a water commission to attract the investment we need to clean up our waterways and rebuild our broken water infrastructure. The commission\u2019s findings will help shape new legislation to reform the water sector so it properly serves the interests of customers and the environment.\u201d The news comes as Ofwat considers how much it will allow companies to raise bills by, with water firms having asked the regulator to let them increase charges by up to 84% over the next five years. All options were on the table to reform the regulators, including abolishing Ofwat, Defra officials said on Tuesday. Public anger has grown in recent years over the large sums of money made by water bosses in England while water supplies have dwindled and sewage has been spilled into rivers. There has also been anger at the mismanagement of companies such as Thames Water, which have been loaded with debt and paid shareholders billions in dividends. Since privatisation in 1989, the English and Welsh water companies have collectively paid \u00a378bn in dividends and accumulated \u00a360bn in debt. Reed said he was not considering nationalisation as part of the review, which would cost \u201ctens of billions of pounds\u201d. But the commission, chaired by the former deputy governor of the Bank of England Jon Cunliffe, will consider all other options to ensure infrastructure is built and sewage stops spilling into waterways. Cunliffe\u2019s independent commission will draw upon a panel of experts from across the regulatory, environment, health, engineering, customer, investor and economic sectors. Water company representatives will not be on the panel but will be consulted for their views. Environmental groups have expressed concern after Defra said the key aim of the commission was to reform the regulators so they encouraged investment and growth. They have said the environment should be prioritised over economic growth, but Defra sources said that without investment, the reservoirs and sewers needed to tackle the climate and nature emergencies could not be built. James Wallace, the CEO of campaign group River Action, said: \u201cWe must not see the environment sacrificed on the altar of economic growth. The water commission must stop vampiric business interests and international investors sucking the lifeblood and money from our waterways and communities. It must deliver a fully funded national action plan to end pollution for profit, enforce laws, and reform regulators. \u201cTaking a look at our neighbours in Europe shows a range of approaches from wholly nationalised to not-for-profit organisations including a blend of private, public and mutualised models. The key is effective economic and environmental regulation that incentivises operating for public benefit and makes polluters pay.\u201d Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cToo much emphasis on making the sector attractive to big international investors like Macquarie is the exact reason why our waterways are in such an appalling state today. With a natural monopoly on an essential resource like water, we need a regulatory system that forces the industry to provide an acceptable minimum level of service, including an end to the routine discharges of raw sewage. \u201cIf big international investors are unable to make sufficient profit in that environment, then clearly this is not a problem that can be solved by big international investors, and the government will have to do what every other country in the world has done and look at other ownership options.\u201d Decisions made by the independent commission will not come into force until the 2029 price review.

      "bodyText": "The former Abercrombie &amp; Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries was arrested on Tuesday as part of a criminal sex trafficking investigation by federal prosecutors, the FBI in Brooklyn and the New York police department have announced. Authorities allege that Jeffries, his British partner Matthew Smith and a third man, Jim Jacobson, ran an \u201cinternational sex trafficking organization\u201d that coerced \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of men into sexual acts, often for the promise of a modeling career with the clothing retailer. \u201cPowerful individuals for too long have trafficked and abused, for their own sexual pleasure, young people with few resources and a dream \u2013 the dream of securing a successful career in fashion or entertainment,\u201d the US attorney in Brooklyn, Breon Peace, said at a news conference discussing the indictments of Jeffries, Smith and Jacobson. \u201cTo anyone who thinks they can exploit others by using the so-called casting couch system \u2013 this case should serve as a warning,\u201d Peace said. \u201cPrepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison.\u201d Prosecutors said 15 victims came forward to accuse the men of running an international sex trafficking organization from late 2008 to 2015. Prosecutors said victims were flown around the world to international hotels in London, Italy and St Bart\u2019s, among others \u2013 and to Jeffries\u2019 homes in New York City and the exclusive Hamptons on Long Island. Jacobson acted as the recruiter, according to investigators, often forcing men into sexual \u201ctryouts\u201d before bringing them to Smith and Jeffries. The pair would then pick men for sex parties, at times coercing them to drink alcohol, take the erectile dysfunction medication Viagra, or muscle relaxant drugs known colloquially as \u201cpoppers\u201d. At times, Jeffries and Smith would also forcibly inject the men with an \u201cerection inducing substance\u201d. Prosecutors said the former CEO and his partner spent millions on the enterprise \u2013 paying Jacobson\u2019s salary, hiring staff for sex parties, renting hotels, and buying tickets for domestic and international travel. \u201cDuring that period the defendants hired dozens of men and transported them to New York and around the globe,\u201d Peace said. Peace added that Jeffries and Smith \u201cspent millions of dollars on a massive infrastructure to support this activity and maintain it\u2019s secrecy\u201d \u2013 and spent \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d in cash for commercial sex acts. The indictment comes after eight men told a 2023 BBC investigation that they had been exploited and recruited for sex events by the former fashion boss. Federal prosecutors began an investigation in January 2024, following a civil suit filed by victims last year. One of the plaintiffs in the civil lawsuit, David Bradberry, said Jeffries forced models to take drugs and engage in sex for a chance to appear in Abercrombie catalogs while the company paid off people who accused Jeffries of sexual abuse or harassment. Jeffries led Abercrombie from 1992 to 2014, making it a successful teen apparel maker known for cologne-filled stores and ads featuring semi-nude models. He resigned amid criticism that he failed to keep up with changing tastes of teen shoppers. An attorney for Bradberry, Brad Edwards of the Edwards Henderson law firm, told ABC News in a statement: \u201cAs we laid out in our lawsuit, this was an Abercrombie-run, sex trafficking organization that permeated throughout the company and allowed the three individuals arrested today to victimize dozens and dozens of young, aspiring male models.\u201d The new federal criminal case against Jeffries, Smith and Jacobson follows many of the same accusations first lodged in civil court, including that Jeffries exploited young men for sex between 2009 to 2015 in cities around the world. Some men alleged they were abused or injected with drugs. Jeffries and his partner denied all allegations in a court filing in response to the lawsuit. Before Jeffries stepped down, his tenure had also drawn scrutiny over its exclusionary marketing, focusing on thin, attractive customers. \u201cWe will respond in detail to the allegations after the indictment is unsealed, and when appropriate, but plan to do so in the courthouse \u2013 not the media,\u201d Brian Bieber, a lawyer for Jeffries, told the Wall Street Journal. Lawyers for Smith did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Jacobson could not immediately be reached for comment. Jeffries was released on a $10m bond, Jacobson on a $500,000 bond, and Smith was detained. They will be arraigned on Friday. Peace said: \u201cI encourage anyone with information about this case, including anyone who was a victim of the defendants\u2019 alleged crimes, to contact the FBI.\u201d The case against Jeffries and his co-defendants is among several high-profile sex trafficking cases that have been pursued by federal prosecutors in New York City in recent years.

      "bodyText": "Scrutiny is growing about the Montana aerial firefighting company once led by Tim Sheehy, the former Navy Seal and Republican Senate candidate who could oust the Democrat incumbent Jon Tester in next month\u2019s election. According to NBC News, Sheehy\u2019s Bridger Aerospace, a company he founded in 2013, negotiated a deal with Gallatin county in eastern Montana to use its pristine credit rating to raise $160m in bonds. The county was meant to benefit from Bridger\u2019s plans to hire more workers and build two new aircraft hangars. But the company used most of the money, or $134m, from the 2022 bond issue to pay back previous investment from Blackstone, a New York-based investment giant. Bridger\u2019s finances have been complicated by the fact that there were fewer wildfires to fight this year and thus less revenue for Bridger. As of Tuesday, the National Interagency Fire Center reported 42,603 wildfires nationwide this year compared with the 10-year average of 48,689 for the same period. In financial filings for the quarterly period that ended 30 June 2024, Bridger said it had \u201ca substantial amount of debt\u201d and that failure to service that debt \u201ccould prolong the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. A victory for Sheehy in November could hand Republicans control of the Senate, making his connections to Bridger a vital topic as voters head to the polls. Sheehy, 38, stepped down as the company\u2019s CEO in July. He has run his campaign partly based on his business acumen. The questions around Gallatin county\u2019s approval of Bridger\u2019s bond deal revolve around whether the board was correctly informed of the company\u2019s financial position \u2013 it has lost $150m since it was founded \u2013 and whether Gallatin\u2019s credit rating could be affected. Marc Cohodes, a Wall Street investor who issued an early warning regarding FTX and its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, as well as calling the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, is among the signatories on a letter to Gallatin county and the US Small Business Administration asking for an investigation into Bridger\u2019s use of capital. The letter questioned why Bridger presented itself to the federal government as a \u201csocially and economically disadvantaged business\u201d. \u201cGallatin County had their name on the bonds and when they default, and they will, lawyers and lawsuits will come after Gallatin County,\u201d Cohodes told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. \u201c\u2018Read the fine print\u2019 will not be a good defense on this.\u201d But Sheehy\u2019s campaign pushed back, saying the deal\u2019s critics were Democratic supporters of Tester. \u201cIt is clear Tester\u2019s supporters wrote this letter with one goal: to hurt Tim\u2019s campaign, tear down a Montana company, and help Jon Tester,\u201d a campaign spokesperson told the Chronicle. \u201cBridger Aerospace is a good company that protects public lands by fighting wildfires, and it is our hope that the authors of this letter cease their efforts to destroy a Montana business, put Montanans out of a job, and wipe out their retirement savings.\u201d Zach Brown, a Gallatin county commissioner, told NBC he was not worried that the bond money had gone to pay Blackstone. \u201cIt isn\u2019t our role to monitor the construction and operational decisions of a private company or communicate to the community the status report of how they\u2019re doing,\u201d Brown told NBC. \u201cOur role is not to monitor whether they added jobs \u2013 it is to endorse the public interest of their project.\u201d While Gallatin county is not on the hook for the bond repayments, the county could see its credit rating affected if Bridger went out of business. Since January last year, when Bridger went public, its stock is down 64%. Bridger reported losses of $77m in 2023 and was at risk of failing to meet its financial obligations. \u201cThe Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, operating cash flow deficits, debt covenant violations, and insufficient liquidity to fund its operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d Bridger\u2019s auditor said, according to the Montana Free Press. The company said in the report that it began cutting costs and had reduced its workforce to 148, down from 166 in 2022. A spokesperson for Bridger told NBC that the company has continued to pay interest on the bonds, which are backed by \u201crobust collateral which has appreciated significantly in value since the bond was issued\u201d and is working to repair its cash flow problems. Separately, Sam Davis, Bridger\u2019s CEO, told the outlet that the company had battled more than 160 Montana wildfires since the bond issue. The county\u2019s support for the company, Davis added, had been \u201ctremendous\u201d and allowed the firefighting company to \u201ccontract with multiple local businesses as we expand and operate our business, and provide a strong customer base to local hotels, restaurants, and transportation providers\u201d. Questions around Bridger come as Sheehy\u2019s service record also has come under scrutiny. The Trump-backed candidate has claimed he was shot in the arm during a firefight in Afghanistan. But a Montana park ranger has claimed that the gunshot wound was self-inflicted in Glacier national park in 2015. Nor do Sheehy\u2019s fellow soldiers recall him mentioning a gunshot wound or seeing a wound at the time during his service in central Asia. Sheehy has insisted that he was shot in Afghanistan and that claims to the contrary are \u201ctantamount to falsely accusing him of stolen valor\u201d. Sheehy has also come under attack for allegedly characterizing Crow Native Americans as \u201cdrunk Indians\u201d. He told Fox News last month they were old recordings, and suggested they were edited, reports the Daily Montanan.",

      "body": "<p>Remember the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/05/clown-sightings-south-carolina-alabama\">creepy clown</a> sightings that started in 2016? All over the world, scary clowns started popping up, terrifying small children. The trend also frightened executives at McDonald\u2019s, who started to phase out Ronald McDonald <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/12/clown-sightings-ronald-mcdonald-keeps-low-profile-amid-creepy-craze\">as a result</a> of the \u201ccurrent climate around clown sightings in communities\u201d.</p> <p>Eight years later there has been another spooky clown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2024/oct/21/donald-trump-makes-fries-during-staged-campaign-event-at-mcdonalds-video\">sighting at a McDonald\u2019s</a> in the Feasterville, Pennsylvania, community. On Sunday Donald Trump popped into the Philadelphia-area fast-food restaurant to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/us-presidential-election-2024-updates-kamala-harris-donald-trump\">serve french fries to hungry passers-by</a>. Or, more accurately, to take photos of himself cosplaying as a minimum wage worker. The former president didn\u2019t work a real shift: the franchise was reportedly closed for normal business hours and the customers who passed through the drive-thru in the 30 minutes he stuck around were all pre-screened.</p> <p>Whoever screened the punters must have got a thumbs-up from Trump after the event, because he clearly approved of the Feasterville clientele. \u201cHello, how are you?\u201d <a href=\"https://x.com/Acyn/status/1848140751810502659\">Trump says cheerfully</a> in a video from his shift, as he hands a bag of food to a blonde woman in a car. \u201cWhat a beautiful woman. Look at the beautiful child, the whole \u2013 it\u2019s like the perfect looking person.\u201d</p> <p>What exactly was this little stunt in aid of? Well, Trump only does things out of self-interest or out of spite. In this case, he was trolling Kamala Harris, who has talked about working at a McDonald\u2019s while she was a student in the 1980s. The vice-president has used this anecdote to emphasize that, unlike Trump, she comes from the middle class and wasn\u2019t raised with a silver spoon in her mouth. Trump is weirdly hung up on Harris\u2019s McDonald\u2019s work history and insists, without any evidence, that she is lying. He chose Harris\u2019s 60th birthday for his fast-food photo op in an apparent attempt to show her who\u2019s boss.

      "bodyText": "Remember the creepy clown sightings that started in 2016? All over the world, scary clowns started popping up, terrifying small children. The trend also frightened executives at McDonald\u2019s, who started to phase out Ronald McDonald as a result of the \u201ccurrent climate around clown sightings in communities\u201d. Eight years later there has been another spooky clown sighting at a McDonald\u2019s in the Feasterville, Pennsylvania, community. On Sunday Donald Trump popped into the Philadelphia-area fast-food restaurant to serve french fries to hungry passers-by. Or, more accurately, to take photos of himself cosplaying as a minimum wage worker. The former president didn\u2019t work a real shift: the franchise was reportedly closed for normal business hours and the customers who passed through the drive-thru in the 30 minutes he stuck around were all pre-screened. Whoever screened the punters must have got a thumbs-up from Trump after the event, because he clearly approved of the Feasterville clientele. \u201cHello, how are you?\u201d Trump says cheerfully in a video from his shift, as he hands a bag of food to a blonde woman in a car. \u201cWhat a beautiful woman. Look at the beautiful child, the whole \u2013 it\u2019s like the perfect looking person.\u201d What exactly was this little stunt in aid of? Well, Trump only does things out of self-interest or out of spite. In this case, he was trolling Kamala Harris, who has talked about working at a McDonald\u2019s while she was a student in the 1980s. The vice-president has used this anecdote to emphasize that, unlike Trump, she comes from the middle class and wasn\u2019t raised with a silver spoon in her mouth. Trump is weirdly hung up on Harris\u2019s McDonald\u2019s work history and insists, without any evidence, that she is lying. He chose Harris\u2019s 60th birthday for his fast-food photo op in an apparent attempt to show her who\u2019s boss. I\u2019m sure she lost a lot of sleep over it. It\u2019s not exactly a secret that Trump isn\u2019t fond of paying for things: hundreds of workers and contractors have accused the former president of not paying his bills. So it\u2019s also possible that, as well as being a dig at Harris, Trump arranged his McDonald\u2019s shift because he wanted a free lunch. He\u2019s certainly fond of fast food. During his stint in the White House he caused quite a stir when he welcomed Clemson University\u2019s championship-winning football team to the White House with a spread of Big Macs laid out on silver platters. He greeted the NCAA\u2019s Football Championship Subdivision champions, North Dakota State, in a similar fashion, noting: \u201cI know you people\u201d before adding: \u201cWe like American companies.\u201d Whatever his motivations, the internet has had a field day with Trump\u2019s trip to the Golden Arches and the felon has earned a new nickname: Donald McDonald. There have also been an abundance of McMemes. The head honchos at McDonald\u2019s Corporation, however, were not quite so amused at having their brand thrust into politics \u2013 particularly as there was a spike in Google searches for \u201cboycott McDonald\u2019s\u201d on Monday morning. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s does not endorse candidates for elected office and that remains true in this race for the next president,\u201d the company said in an internal message seen by Bloomberg News. \u201cWe are not red or blue \u2013 we are golden.\u201d The company also underscored their neutrality by noting that franchisees, who independently own and operate more than 95% of US locations, had invited Harris for a visit.

Liman authorized the two women to immediately begin selling the assets.</p> <p>\u201cThe road to justice for Ruby and Shaye has been long, but they have never wavered,\u201d said Aaron Nathan, a lawyer representing Freeman and Moss. \u201cLast December, a jury delivered a powerful verdict in their favor, and we\u2019re proud that today\u2019s ruling makes that verdict a reality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are proud that our clients will finally begin to receive some of the compensation to which they are entitled for Giuliani\u2019s actions,\u201d said Nathan. \u201cThis outcome should send a powerful message that there is a price to pay for those who choose to intentionally spread disinformation.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Giuliani did not immediately return a request for comment.</p> <p>In addition to his apartment on the Upper East Side Giuliani was also ordered to turn over several items of Yankees memorabilia and around two dozen watches. The two women are also entitled to fees the Trump campaign owes Giuliani for his legal work in 2020.</p> <p>Giuliani <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/01/real-estate/rudy-giuliani-slashes-price-of-nyc-home-by-nearly-1m-in-last-ditch-bid/\">first listed</a> the three-bedroom apartment for $6.5m in 2023, but had cut the price to a little more than $5.1m this fall.</p> <p>Liman did not order Giuliani to turn over a separate Palm Beach condominium, for now, amid an ongoing legal dispute there. Liman instead entered an order barring Giuliani from selling the condo while that dispute is ongoing.</p> <p>After losing the defamation case last fall, Giuliani declared bankruptcy to try and avoid paying Freeman and Moss the money they were owed. A judge dismissed that bankruptcy case earlier this year.</p> <p>After the 2020 election, Giuliani amplified a misleading video and falsely accused Freeman and Moss of illegal activity while counting ballots in Atlanta on election night in 2020. He continued to do so even after Georgia election officials said the video showed both women doing their jobs with no issue. They have also been formally cleared by investigators of any wrongdoing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/30/georgia-election-workers-giuliani-assets-defamation-case\">Georgia election workers ask court for control of Giuliani\u2019s assets over $148m judgment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The video and lie about the two women became central to Donald Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election results in Georgia. The ex-president mentioned Freeman by name on a phone call in 2021 with Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, asking her to overturn the vote.</p> <p>Both women have rarely been seen in public since the incident, but have spoken about how it has upended their lives. They received constant death threats, were chased from their homes, and lost their jobs.

      "bodyText": "Rudy Giuliani must give control of his New York City apartment, a 1980s Mercedes-Benz once owned by Lauren Bacall, several luxury watches and many other assets to two Georgia election workers he defamed. Lewis Liman, a US district judge in New York, appointed Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss as recipients of the property and gave the former New York mayor and Trump confidante seven days to turn over the assets. A jury ruled that Giuliani owes them around $150m for spreading lies about them after the 2020 election though Giuliani is appealing the ruling. Liman authorized the two women to immediately begin selling the assets. \u201cThe road to justice for Ruby and Shaye has been long, but they have never wavered,\u201d said Aaron Nathan, a lawyer representing Freeman and Moss. \u201cLast December, a jury delivered a powerful verdict in their favor, and we\u2019re proud that today\u2019s ruling makes that verdict a reality.\u201d \u201cWe are proud that our clients will finally begin to receive some of the compensation to which they are entitled for Giuliani\u2019s actions,\u201d said Nathan. \u201cThis outcome should send a powerful message that there is a price to pay for those who choose to intentionally spread disinformation.\u201d A spokesperson for Giuliani did not immediately return a request for comment. In addition to his apartment on the Upper East Side Giuliani was also ordered to turn over several items of Yankees memorabilia and around two dozen watches. The two women are also entitled to fees the Trump campaign owes Giuliani for his legal work in 2020. Giuliani first listed the three-bedroom apartment for $6.5m in 2023, but had cut the price to a little more than $5.1m this fall. Liman did not order Giuliani to turn over a separate Palm Beach condominium, for now, amid an ongoing legal dispute there. Liman instead entered an order barring Giuliani from selling the condo while that dispute is ongoing. After losing the defamation case last fall, Giuliani declared bankruptcy to try and avoid paying Freeman and Moss the money they were owed. A judge dismissed that bankruptcy case earlier this year. After the 2020 election, Giuliani amplified a misleading video and falsely accused Freeman and Moss of illegal activity while counting ballots in Atlanta on election night in 2020. He continued to do so even after Georgia election officials said the video showed both women doing their jobs with no issue. They have also been formally cleared by investigators of any wrongdoing. The video and lie about the two women became central to Donald Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election results in Georgia. The ex-president mentioned Freeman by name on a phone call in 2021 with Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, asking her to overturn the vote. Both women have rarely been seen in public since the incident, but have spoken about how it has upended their lives. They received constant death threats, were chased from their homes, and lost their jobs. During the defamation trial in Washington DC, they spoke about the depression they faced after the election. Giuliani, who lost his law license in New York and Washington DC, has shown little regret for his false statements. During the trial, he gave a press conference on the courthouse steps in which he insisted everything he said about Freeman and Moss was true. Freeman and Moss also recently settled a defamation suit with the Gateway Pundit, a far-right news site that was the first to publicly identify them and amplified the video. While the terms of that settlement were confidential, the site has deleted all articles mentioning the two women and posted a notice acknowledging they did not do anything wrong. Freeman and Moss have also settled a lawsuit with One America News Network, another far-right network, which broadcast an apology. All of those cases are being closely watched because they amount to the most significant accountability so far for those who spread lies about the 2020 election. Scholars are closely watching to understand how powerful a tool defamation law can be in curbing misinformation. Giuliani also faces criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",

      "bodyText": "Police chiefs have formally asked the government to make it harder to investigate and prosecute officers after the fatal shooting of Chris Kaba led to a Scotland Yard sergeant being acquitted of murder, the Guardian has learned. Campaigners have criticised the move, saying calls to redraw the rules were a cynical attempt by police leaders to secure \u201ceffective immunity\u201d for their officers. The home secretary is expected to make an announcement imminently about speeding up a review of how police are held to account in England and Wales. A jury took three hours on Monday to throw out the murder charge against Sgt Martyn Blake, the Met police officer who shot dead Kaba, an unarmed suspect. Demands for change have been lodged with the government by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, including a call to make it harder to find officers guilty of unlawful killing at inquests, and also the right for the accused to remain anonymous until conviction, if charged with an offence committed while exercising their duties. The changes would cover all use of force while on duty, not just shootings, while also offering \u201cgreater protections\u201d for police drivers who injure members of the public, or crash. As well as the NPCC, the Metropolitan police have also called for change. The force has asked for anonymity for firearms officers as a minimum, and for all officers who face criminal charges resulting from their duties, until a jury returns a guilty verdict. The officer in the Kaba case, Blake, was named six months after being charged with murder, after a legal challenge to his anonymity by British news organisations. Among the measures police chiefs who make up the NPCC have presented to the government are: Making it harder for the Crown Prosecution Service to charge officers, with police chiefs proposing prosecutors would have to prove training or approved professional practice was not being followed before taking action. Changing the standard of proof required for a verdict of unlawful killing before the inquest into Kaba expected as early as next year. Currently the ruling is made on a balance of probabilities, the civil standard. Police chiefs want it to be the criminal standard, which is beyond reasonable doubt. Making it harder to disprove a claim of self-defence in misconduct inquiries, by changing the standard to the higher criminal test, rather than the current civil test. The head of the leading group for state accountability after deaths condemned the demands. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, which supported the Kaba family, said: \u201cThe cynical attempts to protect the police from the rule of law must be rigorously resisted, as this is in effect giving them immunity. \u201cGiven the disquiet about police killings, the use of force and cultures of racism and misogyny within the police, this will be seen as calculated attempts to evade scrutiny and accountability and further erode public confidence.\u201d A police source with knowledge of discussions denied the move was about securing immunity for officers. The government faces a balancing act in the coming weeks of ensuring officers have the confidence to use their powers while also reassuring communities that police are not above the law. The requests from the Met commissioner, Mark Rowley, would make it less likely officers would face disciplinary or criminal sanction over allegations directly resulting from their exercise of police powers while on duty. A source said with knowledge of Rowley\u2019s thinking said: \u201cThe CPS would have to explain how an officer had departed from their training or policy, as an additional threshold before bringing charges. \u201cThere may be learning, but is a punitive measure appropriate in the majority of cases? There will always be exceptions.\u201d The source stressed the Met did not support greater protection for officers facing allegations while off duty. It means Wayne Couzens, who while a Met officer kidnapped and murdered Sarah Everard, and officers unmasked as serial sex offenders would continue to be pursued and named on charge. The commissioner has warned that fear of investigation and the length of time it takes has led to less stop and search and fewer officers willing to carry a Taser, while the confidence of his firearms officers has been rocked by the charging of Blake. Multiple sources said these concerns were most acute in the Met, where it was feared a guilty verdict against Blake would have led to a large walkout by its firearms officers \u2013 though a significant protest was not expected in other forces around England and Wales. Blake was the second Met firearms officer charged, tried and acquitted of murder, the last being Anthony Long in 2015 after the killing of Azelle Rodney a decade earlier. The family solicitor in both cases was Daniel Machover, who said many of the rules police wanted weakened came from supreme court rulings: \u201cThese proposed changes are both alarming and wholly inappropriate in a modern democracy. What we need as a society is better accountability and not more hurdles to accountability.\u201d Some in the Met believe officers face a politically driven witch-hunt. Long said: \u201cThe IOPC [Independent Office for Police Conduct] are not very talented investigators and they are desperate to prove their credibility to the black community.\u201d The Met has been monitoring community reaction especially in black communities, and has so far detected less anger than feared over Blake\u2019s acquittal. The firearms officer shot the unarmed Kaba in the head when the car was forced to stop, after the vehicle was linked to a firearms incident. Blake told the jury he feared an officer could have been run over in Kaba\u2019s effort to escape. On Tuesday legal restrictions were lifted allowing it to be reported that Kaba was pictured on CCTV shooting a man on a nightclub dancefloor days before he was shot by police, and was alleged to be a core member of the south London-based 67 gang. Details of Kaba\u2019s past offending were not put before the jury in the murder trial at the Old Bailey because the judge, Mr Justice Goss, ruled they were not relevant. Blake, at the point he pulled the trigger on 5 September 2022, did not know these details nor who was in the car.",

Forty firearms and about 300 unlawful ammunitions were handed in, in exchange for a 100 tala ($36) food voucher and an assurance of no prosecution. \u201cIts important to show that we value having our foreign guests here and we want them to feel like they are at home and safe,\u201d Sione says. In the capital Apia, a mass cleanup has been under way for the past two weeks in preparation for the leaders summit in which hundreds of public servants and locals have joined forces to sweep and clear the streets of rubbish. For government worker Salome Tuivasa, it has been a learning experience. \u201cI now know the difference between the New Zealand flag from the Australian flag after putting up our village preparations and I can also identify about 20 countries flag from Chogm,\u201d says Tuivasa. While Tuivasa says he\u2019s \u201cnot too hyped up about the event\u201d he is enjoying the week off and \u201cwill use the time wisely to plant some taro and banana.\u201d Another public servant, Linette Matautia, is pleased to be \u201cwelcoming the world to our home to our Pacific\u201d. \u201cWe do it for the love of our country. Most of us have never left Samoa to see the world and to play a small part in this event even if its just cleaning our beach means a lot. I\u2019ll be showing the world how beautiful our island is,\u201d Matautia says.",

A new NSW Council of Social Services (Ncoss) report, based on modelling of Australian Bureau of Statistics data by researchers at the University of Canberra, found healthcare had become less accessible for more people. Those on low incomes still struggle the most to see a doctor: there was a 301% increase in the proportion of this demographic who delayed or avoided a GP visit due to the cost between 2020 and 2024. But the proportion of people on middle and high incomes delaying or avoiding the GP also increased significantly: by 243%. The researchers drew from the 2023 patient experience survey contained within the ABS\u2019s multipurpose household survey as well as original data estimations they produced. They found a \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in the proportion of people delaying or not seeing a GP due to cost \u2013 from 2.8% in 2020 to 9.5% in 2024. In 2020, proportionally, 2.8% of NSW residents skipped a GP appointment because of the cost. This increased to 9.5% in 2024. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email People on low incomes attended an average of 5.7 GP appointments in 2020. In 2024 this fell to 4.8 appointments. The report draws on the most recent census data to set the low income threshold at $540 a week in 2021 dollars. It presents all other results as \u201cmedium/high income\u201d. The Ncoss chief executive officer, Cara Varian, said more people weren\u2019t seeing doctors because of the increasing costs of medical services \u2013 propelled in part by the dearth of bulk-billing GPs \u2013 as well as inflation in other areas such as energy. \u201cIt\u2019s been really clear through this research that that reduction in access that\u2019s been driven by cost is actually being felt across all income levels, which was not the case four years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople\u2019s \u2026 ability to spend money on healthcare is reducing.\u201d The Ncoss report found that people in NSW living outside of Sydney were more likely to put off seeing both GPs and specialists and that their experiences were worse the further away they lived. Although the number of visits to specialists and the proportion of people waiting longer than acceptable have remained relatively stable overall, experiences with delays due to cost \u201cworsened significantly\u201d, the report said. In 2020, people in regional NSW attended an average of 1.3 specialist appointments a year. In 2024, this fell to 1.2. While this was a difference of only 5.3%, the proportion of patients in regional NSW who said they had delayed or not seen a specialist due to cost rose by 202%. In 2020, proportionally, 7.9% of regional residents delayed or didn\u2019t see a specialist due to cost. This increased to 24% in 2024. Varian urged the NSW government to improve workforce planning to attract more doctors and dentists to the country, and to improve patient transport options. \u201cPeople who are in regional and rural NSW that are experiencing poverty are less likely to have private health insurance, and they\u2019re also less likely to be able to access the primary health care or specialist care that they need,\u201d she said. Emma Warren, a Newcastle resident who lives with the chronic inflammatory bowl condition Crohn\u2019s disease, said she had struggled to afford GP visits since her doctor had to stop bulk billing in December 2022. Warren, an academic whose illness prevents her from working full-time, said it was also very difficult to book GP and specialist appointments at short notice because doctors were in short supply. She said she was constantly worrying about how to afford medical appointments, medication and food while on the disability support pension. \u201cThere\u2019s weeks I\u2019m surviving on toast and ham sandwiches,\u201d she said. Warren said the state and federal governments should work together and make bulk billing a \u201cmajor policy focus\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t afford private health cover, I but I shouldn\u2019t need it as a disability pensioner,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWhat are they doing so people like me can afford to see a doctor as much as they need to?\u201d Bulk billing is where a GP accepts only a Medicare rebate as payment for an appointment, making it free instead of charging a patient an extra \u201cgap\u201d fee. Australia lost more than 400 dedicated bulk-billing GP clinics from 2023 to 2024, according to Guardian Australia analysis.",

The court order, in response to a lawsuit filed by transparency advocates, came on Tuesday with an end-of-the-week deadline and could shed new light on an episode that saw Trump accused of exploiting America\u2019s most venerated military burial site for campaigning purposes in August. A senior judge on the US district court for the District of Columbia, Paul Friedman, ordered the army to release documentation relating to the episode in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit brought by American Oversight, a group dedicated to the release of public records. It filed the case on 3 October after the army did not response to a previous FOIA request. Several Democrats, including Jamie Raskin, the party\u2019s ranking member on the US House\u2019s oversight committee, had also requested that the army release its incident report into the former president\u2019s 26 August visit to the cemetery, which was supposed to mark the third anniversary of a deadly suicide attack that killed 13 US troops in Kabul during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The court order was hailed by American Oversight\u2019s interim executive director, Chioma Chukwu, who said: \u201cWith the election just two weeks away, the American people have a clear and compelling interest in knowing how the government responded to an alleged incident involving a major presidential candidate who has a history of politicising the military. \u201cThese records belong to the public, and we\u2019re pleased the court agreed on the need to expedite our request. We look forward to receiving the incident report and making it available to the public.\u201d Trump\u2019s cemetery visit erupted into a highly charged political row when members of his campaign staff became embroiled in a scuffle with a female cemetery worker after she tried to enforce regulations by preventing them from filming and photographing in a restricted area reserved for fallen members of the US armed forces. Democrats have sought to make the visit an election issue, arguing it portrays Trump\u2019s disrespect for military members, which has also been documented in numerous comments attributed to him by former aides. The army issued a rare rebuke to the Trump campaign team over the episode, noting: \u201cFederal laws, army regulations and [Department of Defense] policies \u2026 clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds.\u201d Trump visited the cemetery at the invitation of some fallen service members\u2019 relatives to attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. He then moved on to Section 60, a burial site for those killed at war in Iraq and Afghanistan, where picture taking is prohibited. Pictures and footage of the former president smiling broadly and giving the thumbs-up sign were subsequently released and circulated on social media. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and later released letters of support from families who had been involved in his visit. Other families criticised the visit. Kamala Harris, Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent in the presidential election, accused him of \u201cdisrespect[ing] sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt\u201d. Democrats argued that the real purpose of Trump\u2019s visit was not to honour fallen soldiers but to make political capital out of the Biden administration\u2019s heavily criticised handling of the Afghan withdrawal during an election campaign.",

Rodgers clearly believes Celtic are not afforded proper context when it comes to performances against superior, and richer, Champions League clubs.</p> <p>The subplot is that Celtic enjoy a similar situation on the domestic front but their manager has insisted coverage of their European shortcomings has been unfair. Rodgers and his team were widely lauded for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/18/celtic-slovan-bratislava-champions-league-match-report\">dismantling Slovan Bratislava</a> at the onset of this European campaign.</p> <p>Asked whether expectation attached to Celtic in the Champions League is disproportionate, \u00adRodgers said: \u201cI think that if you get any sort of common sense and logic, you would see that. But it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t count. You don\u2019t get the leeway. That\u2019s the reality of it. It\u2019s an opportunity for people to beat you over the head with a stick and that\u2019s clear.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to get too emotional about it. I don\u2019t listen too much. It\u2019s a perfect storm for some people. You know that when you lose, especially when you come into Europe, that they will write a great piece \u2026 \u00adactually, they\u2019ve been saving it for probably a number of months. So that\u2019s the opportunity to do it.</p>    <p>\u201cI can\u2019t change that. I\u2019m not even going to be bothered to try, to be \u00adhonest. There\u2019s no leeway given. So we just have to concentrate on our own club, keep trying to improve and see where it takes us.\u201d</p> <p>Rodgers readily admitted the Dortmund affair \u201cfelt like an assault\u201d on Celtic\u2019s spirit. The tests barely get any easier. Celtic are in northern Italy for a clash with Atalanta, the \u00adfree-\u00adscoring Europa League winners.</p> <p>\u00adRodgers continues to resist calls to alter what is typically an attacking tactical approach. \u201cI started coaching over 25 years ago and from the very beginning, my coaching has always been aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil the day I finish, it will be aggressive. That\u2019s how I work.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m also respectful that you play against teams at a certain level and certain opponents, where you have to really look at their strengths. I don\u2019t tell them not to do that in every game, because I do, no matter what team I\u2019m playing, whether it\u2019s in Scotland or in the Champions League. It\u2019s the level at which you can get punished. So I think it\u2019s one where you have to have the balance in your game.\u201d</p> <p>Rodgers added: \u201cYou have to be really strong defensively. There are going to be moments when you can press the game high. There are going to be moments when you\u2019re lower on the pitch. And I think the key learning for us has to be that when you are in those moments, you cannot go on your own. We\u2019ve got a very, very inexperienced squad of players playing at this level.\u201d</p> <p>Celtic will again be without Cameron Carter-Vickers, their first-choice centre-half, in Bergamo. The left-back Greg Taylor also did not travel to Lombardy because of injury.</p>",

Rodgers and his team were widely lauded for dismantling Slovan Bratislava at the onset of this European campaign. Asked whether expectation attached to Celtic in the Champions League is disproportionate, Rodgers said: \u201cI think that if you get any sort of common sense and logic, you would see that. But it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t count. You don\u2019t get the leeway. That\u2019s the reality of it. It\u2019s an opportunity for people to beat you over the head with a stick and that\u2019s clear. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get too emotional about it. I don\u2019t listen too much. It\u2019s a perfect storm for some people. You know that when you lose, especially when you come into Europe, that they will write a great piece \u2026 actually, they\u2019ve been saving it for probably a number of months. So that\u2019s the opportunity to do it. \u201cI can\u2019t change that. I\u2019m not even going to be bothered to try, to be honest. There\u2019s no leeway given. So we just have to concentrate on our own club, keep trying to improve and see where it takes us.\u201d Rodgers readily admitted the Dortmund affair \u201cfelt like an assault\u201d on Celtic\u2019s spirit. The tests barely get any easier. Celtic are in northern Italy for a clash with Atalanta, the free-scoring Europa League winners. Rodgers continues to resist calls to alter what is typically an attacking tactical approach. \u201cI started coaching over 25 years ago and from the very beginning, my coaching has always been aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil the day I finish, it will be aggressive. That\u2019s how I work. \u201cBut I\u2019m also respectful that you play against teams at a certain level and certain opponents, where you have to really look at their strengths. I don\u2019t tell them not to do that in every game, because I do, no matter what team I\u2019m playing, whether it\u2019s in Scotland or in the Champions League. It\u2019s the level at which you can get punished. So I think it\u2019s one where you have to have the balance in your game.\u201d Rodgers added: \u201cYou have to be really strong defensively. There are going to be moments when you can press the game high. There are going to be moments when you\u2019re lower on the pitch. And I think the key learning for us has to be that when you are in those moments, you cannot go on your own. We\u2019ve got a very, very inexperienced squad of players playing at this level.\u201d Celtic will again be without Cameron Carter-Vickers, their first-choice centre-half, in Bergamo. The left-back Greg Taylor also did not travel to Lombardy because of injury.",

Saying she was left traumatized by what she witnessed, she added: \u201cI can still hear people screaming. I can still see [a] lady that was [subsequently] going around asking for blankets\u201d to carry before the arrival of rescue equipment. Hicks, who traveled to the site of the dock collapse as part of her senior traveling club, also said: \u201cI think it was too much weight on it because they had all them walkers, they had all them wheelchairs, they had all them people and that thing just [went] \u2018bam\u2019 \u2013 it just went out. \u201cIt was a day I don\u2019t want to see [any] more.\u201d About 40 people were waiting for a ferry to take them from Sapelo Island, Georgia, to the mainland when the aluminum dock they were standing on collapsed. At least 20 people fell into into water laden with sharp oyster shells because of a low tide, and not all of them could be rescued or save themselves. Seven people \u2013 all between the ages of 74 and 93 \u2013 died. They were among the hundreds of visitors touring Sapelo Island, where the last Gullah Geechee community of Black descendants lives. The island was hosting an annual cultural festival at the time of the dock collapse, which officials said resulted from a \u201ccatastrophic failure\u201d of the gangway structure whose exact cause has remained under investigation in the days since. Hicks was part of a tour group that included the oldest collapse victim to die: 93-year-old Carlotta McIntosh. McIntosh was \u201cthe life of our club\u201d, Hicks said. \u201cEverywhere that club goes she would always be there,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cShe had a walker but she could still get on that walker and go.\u201d McIntosh\u2019s granddaughter, Atiyya Hassan, told the Georgia news outlet WSB that \u201cthe shock has [not] worn down yet\u201d. \u201cI wanted people to know she\u2019s vibrant,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cShe was independent.

      "body": "<p>This week, there was a pivotal moment in Britain\u2019s debate over police shootings, as a jury <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/21/martyn-blake-met-police-officer-who-shot-chris-kaba-acquitted\">acquitted</a> a police officer of murdering a young Black man in south London. The case raises questions about how the police can operate effectively and with public confidence while being held accountable for any improper actions. Such deaths leave Black families grieving and officers resentful for being put on trial. The 2011 shooting of another Black man led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">biggest riots</a> in modern English history.</p> <p>The hope is that no such unrest follows the acquittal of the Metropolitan police officer Martyn Blake, who was cleared of murdering 24-year-old Chris Kaba by shooting him in the head in 2022. Jurors took just three hours to reach a unanimous verdict after three weeks of arguments at the Old Bailey. For Mr Kaba\u2019s family, it was confirmation that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c17lk592ygdo\">his life does not matter to the system</a>\u201d.

Mr Blake ended up at the Old Bailey because although he gave a short statement immediately after Mr Kaba\u2019s death, he later refused to answer questions from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Instead, he submitted a 24-page written statement to the police watchdog. The jury was shown a police video that appeared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/15/met-police-officer-denies-exaggerating-threat-to-justify-shooting-chris-kaba\">contradict</a> his account.

Mr Kaba\u2019s lawyers also <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/chris-kaba-shooter-aquitted\">criticised</a> the IOPC for not treating officers as suspects from the outset. In court, Mr Blake defended his actions, claiming he feared that Mr&nbsp;Kaba would use the car he was driving as a weapon. This was the crux of the case: the police officer knew that by firing a bullet he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/21/what-we-now-know-about-the-13-seconds-before-chris-kaba-was-shot\">kill or seriously wound Mr&nbsp;Kaba</a>, but he did so in \u201clawful self-defence\u201d. It is important to note that Mr Blake didn\u2019t know who was driving, only that the car had been linked to a previous shooting. The judge rightly ruled that Mr&nbsp;Kaba\u2019s prior convictions and actions \u2013 including allegedly shooting a man \u2013 were irrelevant to the trial.</p> <p>The case underscores how narratives, not just facts, shape perceptions of justice.

      "body": "<p>In one regard \u2013 and one regard only \u2013 North Korea appears to have moved somewhat closer to global norms. Several state media outlets have abruptly <a href=\"https://www.nknews.org/2024/10/north-korea-drops-juche-calendar-in-apparent-bid-to-elevate-kim-jong-uns-legacy/\">abandoned their use of the Juche, or \u201cself-reliance\u201d, calendar</a>, giving only Gregorian dates. Days before, they had also placed North Korea in the year 113, since the Juche system begins with the birth of the country\u2019s first leader Kim Il-sung in 1912 \u2013 though it was not adopted until 1997 (or the year 86).</p> <p>The onward march of the Gregorian calendar, first across western Europe and then the globe, appears relentless. Yet a handful of countries hold out. Iran&nbsp;and Afghanistan use the solar and lunar Islamic Hijri calendars respectively, placing their citizens in 1446&nbsp;AH. Nepal\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Samvat\">Vikram Samvat calendar</a> runs more than half a century ahead of the Gregorian. The&nbsp;Ethiopian calendar, like the Gregorian, is dated from the birth of Christ \u2013 but probably more accurately,&nbsp;according to Biblical scholars, since it places it in 7BC.</p> <p>Many countries rely on alternative systems for religious purposes \u2013 in Orthodox countries, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar\">Julian calendar</a>; in Gulf countries, the Islamic Hijri system. But others use dual systems for civil matters, as North Korea did. Thailand is speeding through the 26th&nbsp;century, thanks to a calendar said to commence with the death of the Buddha. In the Hebrew calendar <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/2014-09-25/ty-article/.premium/the-secrets-of-the-hebrew-calendar/0000017f-db3f-df62-a9ff-dfff86dd0000\">used by Israel</a>, said to begin with the creation of the world, the year 5785 has just begun. In Japan, the era system \u2013 dated from the accession of each emperor&nbsp;\u2013 is still widely used, especially for official purposes. A&nbsp;Nobel&nbsp;prize-winning scientist and a former supreme court judge were among those who selected the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/01/reiwa-how-japans-new-era-name-is-breaking-tradition\">name of the latest era, Reiwa</a>, which began in 2019.</p> <p>In a globalised world, where the same television shows, fashions and brands of coffee can be consumed from Seoul to Lagos to Sydney, there can be value and charm in preserving distinct cultures and identities. But our ways of ordering time are <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1179/030801800679305\">inescapably political</a>. Some see Japan\u2019s era system as an anachronism in a society no longer ruled by emperors. In the mid 1970s, the Shah of Iran decreed that the calendar should start with the reign of Cyrus the Great rather than the Hijrah of the prophet Muhammad, catapulting his country forward 1,180 years. Following his overthrow, it reverted to the earlier&nbsp;dating system.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s 1752 switch from the Julian to Gregorian calendar <a href=\"https://www.history.co.uk/article/the-calendar-riots-of-1752-when-britain-lost-11-days\">prompted concerns</a> over its sovereignty and Catholic influence as well as conspiracy theories: some feared their lives were being shortened by 11 days. In North Korea\u2019s case, Kim Jong-un <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/aug/27/north-korea-leaders-kim-jong-un-pictures\">capitalised on his resemblance</a> to his grandfather in the early years of his rule. Now he seems to be promoting his own status and relying less on his lineage. Downplaying Kim Il-sung\u2019s birth may be part of that.</p> <p>Historical differences in understanding and arranging time have reflected not only the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00548m9\">inherent difficulties of the task</a> but also beliefs \u2013 or official statements \u2013 about what matters.

      "bodyText": "In one regard \u2013 and one regard only \u2013 North Korea appears to have moved somewhat closer to global norms. Several state media outlets have abruptly abandoned their use of the Juche, or \u201cself-reliance\u201d, calendar, giving only Gregorian dates. Days before, they had also placed North Korea in the year 113, since the Juche system begins with the birth of the country\u2019s first leader Kim Il-sung in 1912 \u2013 though it was not adopted until 1997 (or the year 86). The onward march of the Gregorian calendar, first across western Europe and then the globe, appears relentless. Yet a handful of countries hold out. Iran and Afghanistan use the solar and lunar Islamic Hijri calendars respectively, placing their citizens in 1446 AH. Nepal\u2019s Vikram Samvat calendar runs more than half a century ahead of the Gregorian. The Ethiopian calendar, like the Gregorian, is dated from the birth of Christ \u2013 but probably more accurately, according to Biblical scholars, since it places it in 7BC. Many countries rely on alternative systems for religious purposes \u2013 in Orthodox countries, the Julian calendar; in Gulf countries, the Islamic Hijri system. But others use dual systems for civil matters, as North Korea did. Thailand is speeding through the 26th century, thanks to a calendar said to commence with the death of the Buddha. In the Hebrew calendar used by Israel, said to begin with the creation of the world, the year 5785 has just begun. In Japan, the era system \u2013 dated from the accession of each emperor \u2013 is still widely used, especially for official purposes. A Nobel prize-winning scientist and a former supreme court judge were among those who selected the name of the latest era, Reiwa, which began in 2019. In a globalised world, where the same television shows, fashions and brands of coffee can be consumed from Seoul to Lagos to Sydney, there can be value and charm in preserving distinct cultures and identities. But our ways of ordering time are inescapably political. Some see Japan\u2019s era system as an anachronism in a society no longer ruled by emperors. In the mid 1970s, the Shah of Iran decreed that the calendar should start with the reign of Cyrus the Great rather than the Hijrah of the prophet Muhammad, catapulting his country forward 1,180 years. Following his overthrow, it reverted to the earlier dating system. Britain\u2019s 1752 switch from the Julian to Gregorian calendar prompted concerns over its sovereignty and Catholic influence as well as conspiracy theories: some feared their lives were being shortened by 11 days. In North Korea\u2019s case, Kim Jong-un capitalised on his resemblance to his grandfather in the early years of his rule. Now he seems to be promoting his own status and relying less on his lineage. Downplaying Kim Il-sung\u2019s birth may be part of that. Historical differences in understanding and arranging time have reflected not only the inherent difficulties of the task but also beliefs \u2013 or official statements \u2013 about what matters. The \u201cclock time\u201d that has spread since the Industrial Revolution has come to dominate \u201cnature time\u201d and \u201cevent time\u201d, making us fit our lives to the clock rather than to daylight hours or what we wish or need to do. Similarly, the calendar can be a tool of power and control. Time systems originated in our attempts to order the world. Inevitably, they become systems that end up ordering us.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned the trade tariffs favoured by US presidential candidate Donald Trump could hurt global growth, as it upgraded its forecast for the UK economy. The Washington-based organisation said tariffs trigger tit-for-tat trade wars that impoverish the economies involved in the dispute and the wider global economy. It said there had been a very sharp increase in the number of trade-distorting measures implemented by countries over the last five years, from 1,000 in 2019 to 3,000 today and a fresh round of tariffs would create further harm. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThere is definitely a direction of travel here that we are very concerned about, because a lot of these trade-distorting measures could reflect decisions by countries that are self-centred and could be ultimately harmful not only to the global economy \u2026 but also hurtful for the countries who implement them as well.\u201d He added: \u201cThe impact on global trade also makes the residents of a country [implementing tariffs] poorer.\u201d The IMF has forecast growth of 3.2% for the world economy this year and next but said on Tuesday that higher tariffs on a \u201csizeable swath\u201d of world trade by the middle of next year could cut 0.8% from output in 2025, and 1.3% in 2026. As he prepares for the US election on 5 November, Trump has outlined plans to impose significant tariffs on imported goods, a policy that is likely to trigger a series of tit-for-tat measures. China is expected to be his main target, though goods from the European Union could also be in his sights. Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, told Bloomberg that the US had historically thrived during periods of trade, not periods of \u201cI\u2019m going to retire behind my boundaries and play at home\u201d. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, warned that broad tariffs were a \u201cmisguided approach\u201d and would have a negative impact on consumers and export industries. The IMF said in its bi-annual economic outlook that the UK economy would be among those countries to grow faster than previously thought this year, giving the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, a boost before her first budget next week. In a significant revision, UK growth in 2024 is expected to be 1.1%, up from a projection of 0.7% in July. The IMF\u2019s forecast for 1.5% growth next year was unchanged. Reeves, who is due to join finance ministers and central bank governors on Thursday at the IMF\u2019s annual meeting in the US capital, has made economic growth the centrepiece of Labour\u2019s plans over the next five years. The IMF said that nations such as the UK that depend on services had grown strongly this year, leaving behind those including Germany that were more reliant on selling manufactured goods. The IMF said UK growth would pick up to 1.5% in 2025, as falling inflation and interest rates stimulate domestic demand. Reeves said: \u201cIt\u2019s welcome that the IMF have upgraded our growth forecast for this year, but I know there is more work to do. \u201cThat is why the budget next week will be about fixing the foundations to deliver change, so we can protect working people, fix the NHS and rebuild Britain.\u201d The UK is expected to be the joint third fastest-growing economy in the G7 this year, in line with France and behind the US which is on course to grow by 2.8% and Canada, which is forecast to grow by 1.3%. Italy lags behind with 0.7% growth, Japan with 0.3% and zero growth in struggling Germany. Gourinchas said Europe was on a steady and improving path but growth remained lower than in the decades leading up to the 2008 financial crash. However, in a cautionary message Gourinchas said that countries such as the UK were treading a \u201cnarrow path\u201d as they try to bring debt levels down while continuing to increase public investment. Without commenting directly on next week\u2019s budget, Gourinchas said that when countries have elevated debt levels, interest rates were high, and growth was \u201cOK but not great\u201d, there is a risk that \u201cthings could escalate or get out of control quickly\u201d. Gourinchas said the global economy had remained \u201cunusually resilient throughout the disinflationary process\u201d of the last two years when central banks raised borrowing costs to calm spiralling prices. \u201cMonetary policy played a decisive role by keeping inflation expectations anchored, avoiding deleterious wage-price spirals, and a repeat of the disastrous inflation experience of the 1970s,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe decline in inflation without a global recession is a major achievement.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A key Saudi suspect in the murder of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 had his account reinstated on X, the social media company controlled by Elon Musk, after it was permanently suspended under the company\u2019s previous owner. Saud al-Qahtani, a onetime key adviser to Mohammed bin Salman, had \u201cdirect involvement\u201d in the murder of Khashoggi, according to a US intelligence assessment released by the Biden administration in 2021. Hours after the Guardian reported on the account being reinstated, it was suspended again. An X spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cDue to an error the suspension was originally lifted, but it has since been reinstated.\u201d The US assessment found that the crown prince had approved the grisly operation in Turkey that killed the Washington Post columnist, who was dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The US assessment also pointed out that the 15-member Saudi team that traveled to Istanbul to target Khashoggi included officials who worked for the Saudi Center for Studies and Media Affairs (CSMARC), which Qahtani headed. In that role, he was referred to among Saudi dissidents as the \u201clord of the flies\u201d. Qahtani and his subordinate, Maher Mutreb, were sanctioned by the US treasury in 2018 for their involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s murder. Qahtani seemed to disappear from public view after he was hit with the sanctions, but Saudi prosecutors ruled in December 2019 that there was no evidence linking Qahtani to the journalist\u2019s murder. It is unclear why Qahtani\u2019s account was reinstated and then suspended again. Experts speculated that it could have been part of a wider attempt by Musk to reinstate users who were previously suspended, or was simply an unintended technical glitch. Saudi Arabia is a key investor in X through its stake in Kingdom Holding, the investment vehicle controlled by Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whose investment in the platform dates back to 2011. The company that was previously known as Twitter first suspended Qahtani\u2019s account in September 2019, about a year after he had allegedly been sacked from his role as an adviser to the crown prince. It announced in a blog post at the time that the \u201cpermanent\u201d suspension was a result of violations of the platform\u2019s manipulation policies. It was part of a broader move to shut down Saudi\u2019s \u201cstate-run media apparatus\u201d, which amplified pro-Saudi messages across social media networks. After his suspension in 2019, Qahtani\u2019s account \u2013 which had 1.2m followers \u2013 appeared blank, and the words \u201caccount suspended\u201d appeared under his handle. Then the account was back online, only to be suspended again hours later. A review of previous tweets shows that the Saudi adviser was visiting New York in late September 2018, days before the Khashoggi killing. It is not clear what role, if any, Musk had in reinstating Qahtani\u2019s account. The move comes at a time when the billionaire has played a key role in supporting the candidacy of Republican candidate Donald Trump. \u201cIt is a telling indictment of the current state of X that a man suspected of involvement in the killing of a Saudi journalist, who was also suspended for manipulating Twitter, and who personally created a black list of those critical of Saudi regime policy, is having his account reinstated,\u201d said Marc Owen Jones. Jones said it was possible that the account was reinstated due to a technical glitch, but said X was \u201csuch a black box\u201d that it was hard to know. He said it was possible that Musk\u2019s quest to reinstate previously banned users has gone \u201cglobal\u201d and that it was reinstated as part of an automated drive. \u201cBut Saudi have a big stake in X so they could be using their leverage or there could be some pressure to bring back and rehabilitate [him].

Musk has reinstated several controversial figures who have previously been banned, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, the US congresswoman, and Trump. \u201cReinstating the accounts of individuals who violated the platform\u2019s policies has allowed malicious actors to take advantage of the change in Twitter\u2019s leadership to adapt their manipulation tactics, as seen in this case, without fear of consequences,\u201d DFRLab concluded.",

The survey, conducted by the Arab News Research and Studies Unit along with YouGov, shows 43% supporting Trump compared with 41% for Harris, and 4% backing the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein. The figures are broadly in line with a previous poll carried out this month by the Arab American Institute. Together they suggest that Harris\u2019s support in the community has been undermined by the Biden administration\u2019s backing for Israel\u2019s year-long war against Hamas in Gaza. The latest poll also shows Trump leading Harris by 39% to 33% on the question of which candidate would be most likely resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while the candidates were tied at 38% apiece on who would be \u201cbetter for the Middle East in general\u201d. Support for Trump is particularly striking given that the same poll shows twice as many respondents \u2013 46% to 23% \u2013 think anti-Arab racism and hate crimes are likely to increase under a Trump presidency compared with under Harris. The former president has repeatedly used the term \u201cPalestinian\u201d as an insult against his Democratic opponents, and derided them as insufficiently supportive of Israel. The findings are also surprising given that Trump\u2019s presidency was characterised by a strong pro-Israel policy tilt. He was responsible for a historic decision to move the US embassy in the country from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the status of which is hotly disputed by Israelis and Palestinians. The perception of him as ardently pro-Israel is reflected in the poll, which shows 69% of respondents believe he is the most supportive of the country\u2019s interests, compared with 60% for Harris. The vice-president \u2013 whose husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish \u2013 has trod a delicate course while attempting to claw back the support of Arab voters forfeited by Biden. She has repeatedly affirmed Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, while also voicing concern over the escalating casualties and worsening situation in Gaza. She greeted last week\u2019s death of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by saying it offered a chance to end the war. Trump has claimed that last October\u2019s deadly attack by Hamas would not have happened on his watch. He appealed explicitly to Arab voters on Monday as Harris campaigned in Michigan with Liz Cheney, the former Republican member of Congress whose father, Dick Cheney, played a key role in the invasion of Iraq as George W Bush\u2019s vice-president.

The earlier Arab American Institute survey also showed Harris with 41% support, compared with 42% for Trump and 12% for third-party candidates. It concluded that while Harris had recovered some support ceded by Biden, she was still far behind the 59% of the Arab vote captured by the US president in his 2020 election win over Trump. Polls show Harris and Trump in a virtual deadlock in Michigan, which Trump narrowly won in 2016 but lost to Biden four years later.",

Most of the children would be based in Egypt. </p> <p>The families also urged Starmer to set up a family reunification scheme for Palestinian refugees that includes legal pathways for families separated from loved ones in Gaza. The scheme would be modelled on the scheme operating for Ukraine, and no figure has been proposed for how many that could be allowed to come</p> <p>On aid restrictions ministers have already acknowledged that Israel is restricting aid in an unacceptable way especially this month, but have not yet said ministers believe Israel is implementing what is in effect a campaign to starve Palestinians out of Northern Gaza as part of a so-called \u201cGeneral\u2019s plan\u201d that has been endorsed by the extreme right in Israel.</p> <p>The families called for a British personnel presence at border crossings to ensure agile inspection processes and monitor and ensure that aid flows unrestricted into Gaza. Britain has repeatedly been denied a diplomatic presence on the aid crossing points, but has supplied \u00a31m in emergency aid for medical evacuees in Egypt.</p> <p>Israel insists aid has increased since a US warning more than a week ago that arms supplies would be blocked unless 300 aid trucks entered Gaza a day.</p> <p>One of the family members reflected on the meeting, saying: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is hard to talk about this collective trauma, but political leaders must hear our testimonies directly, so they understand the real-life impact of their policies. </p> <p>Bringing 15 children to the UK is a tiny ask compared to the 34,000 injured, and that\u2019s before even mentioning 16,000 killed and 21,000 missing.

But she did not set out any specific measures apart from diplomatic pressure to ensure a change.</p> <p>In what the minister saw as a clarification, she told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the 2 September decision there are currently no extant UK export licences for items to Israel that we assess might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of UK humanitarian law.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said the only one exception is UK supplied components for F35s joint strike fighter program. She added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most licences for exports to Israel are absolutely not for the Israeli Defence Forces and I am pleased to put that on the record.</p> </blockquote> <p>She added later there had been misconceptions about the arms exports that have not been suspended.</p> <p>At the time of the September statement the Foreign Office said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of export licences which we have assessed are not for military use in the current conflict in Gaza and therefore do not require suspension. These include items that are not being used by the IDF in the current conflict (such as trainer aircraft or other naval equipment), and other, non-military items. Export licences cover a range of products including things such as food-testing chemicals, telecoms and data equipment.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Foreign Office has so far refused to publish a list of the suspended and non-suspended arms export licences, or their customers.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6717c20b8f08deab319f392b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-22T15:19:30.835Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Howard League for Penal Reform</strong> has issued <a href=\"https://howardleague.org/news/a-once-in-a-generation-opportunity-to-reform-sentencing-policy/\">a statement</a> welcoming the sentencing review announced today.

Despite this, revenue from wealth taxes has remained stagnant at around 3.4% of the UK\u2019s GDP, proportionately only one percent higher than rates in 1965. This stands in contrast to other trends in the tax system, meaning that the richest are relatively under-taxed.

The results were remarkable. Crime fell by nearly a third, reaching the lowest levels in half a century.

Those under home detention curfews are in practice under a form of house arrest with a tag on their ankle and a censor in their home. They are placed on the curfews, generally for 12 hours each day. Should they break that curfew, they can be picked up and if need be locked up.</p> <p>In some ways, punishment outside a prison can be even more restrictive than prison.

This is especially crucial for voters who switched to Labour in 2024. Among general election 2024 switchers to Labour, a scenario in which government debt and deficits have been reduced but NHS waiting lists are unchanged leads to a government approval rating of -12, a fall of 28 percentage points from current approval ratings with switchers.</p> <p>Instead, the public prefer the government to borrow more, find additional tax revenues (within their rules) and deliver on change - with a particular focus on public services. A scenario where waiting lists are halved \u2013 even at the expense of debt or taxes rising \u2013 leads to a +31 approval rating with this group, 15 percentage points higher than now. Similar results are found seen for Conservative to Labour switchers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Steve Akehurst from <strong>Persuasion UK</strong>, a research company that worked with the IPPR on the report, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>It\u2019s clear from this research that voters will not reward Labour simply for being good stewards of the economy.

It is borne out by the experience of the more successful opposition leaders in recent history, from Churchill to Thatcher. Her chosen values of truth, personal responsibility, active citizenship, equality under the law and family \u2013 in the broadest, modern sense of family \u2013 are strong foundations on which to rethink policies over several years.

He told the Tory conference:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Prison works. It ensures that we are protected from murderers, muggers and rapists - and it makes many who are tempted to commit crime think twice \u2026 This may mean that more people will go to prison. I do not flinch from that. We shall no longer judge the success of our system of justice by a fall in our prison population.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, around that time, the prison population in England and Wales started to soar. The election of a Labour government did not make any difference to this trend; Howardism prevailed.</p>    <p>Today, is that all going to change? As <strong>Rajeev Syal</strong> reports in our overnight story, to coincide with the 1,100 more criminals being let out as part of the early release policy introduced by Labour to deal with the jail overcrowding crisis, <strong>Shabana Mahmood</strong>, the justice secretary, is announcing a review of sentencing policy, which will be carried out by David Gauke, the former Conservative justice secretary. It will consider alternatives to sending people to jail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/oct/21/england-and-wales-sentencing-overhaul-could-bring-in-home-detention\">Judges could impose house arrest on criminals as part of major overhaul of sentencing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Ministry of Justice\u2019s press release about the review is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-sentencing-review-launched-to-end-prison-crisis\">here</a>. And the terms of refererence are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/independent-sentencing-review-2024-to-2025\">here</a>.</p> <p>Mahmood has been giving interviews this morning and it has been notable that she has not been declaring war on the Michael Howard approach. The <strong>Ministry of Justice</strong> says that one of the principles behind the sentencing review is to \u201cmake sure prison sentences punish serious offenders and protect the public\u201d and it says the government is committed to creating 14,000 more prison places. Although the review will consider \u201ctougher punishments outside of prison\u201d, the terms of reference also imply sentences should go up for offences against women and girls.</p> <p>On the Today programme this morning <strong>Nick Robinson</strong> asked Mahmood to clarify how radical she was being. Did she just want to curb the rate at which the prison population was going up? Or did she want fewer people to be jailed, and Britain to stop being \u201cthe European leader in locking people up\u201d? In her reply, <strong>Mahmood</strong> rather fudged it, implying she wanted both. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, the problem is that the rate of increase is such that nobody can keep up with demand, and you risk running out of prison places \u2026 We reach critical capacity again by next summer. We cannot build our way out of this crisis.</p> <p>To put it in context, I have HMP Birmingham in my constituency. That\u2019s a very large, older Victorian prison. It has a capacity of over 1,000. We need to build nearly five of those every single year to keep up with demand. So we do have to manage demand into the prison system.</p> <p>But for a period it\u2019s obvious that demand is going to go up, because we are going to have to build those 14,000 places. If we don\u2019t, we run out of prison places earlier than we would expect.</p> <p>The crisis is so acute that all of these things, building more supply, dealing with demand, have to be part of the solution.</p> <p>But in the end, the sentencing review is our best opportunity to set a new trajectory where we can manage that demand, where I can make sure we never run out of prison places again, where there is a prison place for everyone who needs to be locked up, and where we expand the range of punishments outside of prison.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Gauke</strong> himself has been a bit more willing to denounce Howardism. He has written <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2024/10/how-to-fix-the-prisons-crisis\">an article for the New Statesman </a>about the sentencing review and he says he wants to use it to end the \u201csentencing bidding war\u201d between political parties. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the last 30 years, there has been a sentencing bidding war between the political parties seeking to compete to be seen as the toughest on crime by promising ever-longer prison sentences. Rightly, the public expects criminality to be punished and prison is often viewed as the only effective means of punishment. But the capacity crisis in our prisons has meant that \u2013 at the very least \u2013 we have no choice but to pause the increase in the prison population. It is also sensible that we now look more broadly at the evidence and ask whether sentencing policy should be more fundamentally reformed. By next spring, we should have the answer.</p> </blockquote> <p>There will be a lot more on this as the day goes on.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Keir Starmer chairs cabinet.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>After 12.30pm:</em> Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, makes a statement to MPs about the sentencing review.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media.

      "bodyText": "Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, has said that the Tories are to blame for the fact that the government needed today to release another cohort of prisoners early, saying the prisons crisis was \u201cthe greatest disgrace of the last Conservative government\u201d. (See 5.05pm.) She used the comment as she made a statement to MPs confirming that David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary, will lead a sentencing review for the government. Mahmood also announced further measures to reduce the jail population. (See 2.15pm and 2.16pm.) Potentially the review could lead to a liberalisation of sentencing laws, but Mahmood told MPs that some sentences could get longer, and that \u201cin some ways, punishment outside a prison can be even more restrictive than prison\u201d. (See 1.57pm.) The UK economy will grow faster than previously thought this year, according to an upgraded outlook by the International Monetary Fund in a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, ahead of her first budget next week. Rachel Reeves is facing calls to introduce a \u201cchild lock\u201d to protect spending on child-related benefits in the autumn budget, a move campaigners say would dramatically reduce the number of children in poverty. A leading Uyghur activist has accused the Labour government of \u201cfalling behind\u201d its allies in failing to stand up to China, after ministers backtracked on plans to push for formal recognition of the country\u2019s treatment of the minority group as genocide. Kemi Badenoch has criticised Robert Jenrick, her rival for the Tory leadership, for focusing too much on policy. Yesterday Jenrick said it was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d for her not to have policies. Today, in an interview with the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast, Badenoch said Jenrick\u2019s approach was flawed. She explained: He doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to be standing in four years time. So he uses the word disrespectful. I would not use a word like that about any of the candidates who have have stood \u2026 If this was a general election, yes, it would be wrong to be standing with no policies. This is not a general election. And if you\u2019re going to solve a problem, you need to make sure that you know what the question you\u2019re being asked is. He thinks the question that is being asked is, what are the right policies to win a general election? I think the question being asked, is why should we trust the Conservative party? Ministers have paused plans to open 44 new state schools in England, including three sixth form colleges backed by Eton, while they review each school\u2019s potential demand and value for money, Richard Adams reports. Ministers are adamant that the last government is to blame for the prison overcrowding crisis. Opening her statement to MPs this afternoon on the sentencing review, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, said: The crisis in our prisons was, I believe, the greatest disgrace of the last Conservative government. They left our prisons on the point of collapse\u2014a situation that would have forced us to close the prison doors, cancel all trials and force the police to halt arrests. Crime would have gone unpunished, victims would never have seen justice done, and we would have witnessed the total breakdown of law and order. The previous prime minister knew he had to act. His lord chancellor begged him to do so, but instead he called an election. But voters are not all convinced, polling from YouGov suggests. It says that, while 40% of people think the last government is wholly or more to blame, almost a third of people (29%) think the Conservatives and Labour are equally at fault. Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner today for the first time met a network of British Palestinians to hear calls for an emergency child evacuation scheme, a Palestinian resettlement scheme and tougher measures to break Israel\u2019s blockade on aid. Starmer, accused by some Palestinians of being instinctively too close to Israel, was asked to consider setting up a pilot evacuation scheme for Palestinian children initially starting with 15 children unable to access any healthcare in Gaza. There have been repeated complaints that the Home Office refuses to supply temporary visas to children needed to be admitted to the UK for private medical treatment. Most of the children would be based in Egypt. The families also urged Starmer to set up a family reunification scheme for Palestinian refugees that includes legal pathways for families separated from loved ones in Gaza. The scheme would be modelled on the scheme operating for Ukraine, and no figure has been proposed for how many that could be allowed to come On aid restrictions ministers have already acknowledged that Israel is restricting aid in an unacceptable way especially this month, but have not yet said ministers believe Israel is implementing what is in effect a campaign to starve Palestinians out of Northern Gaza as part of a so-called \u201cGeneral\u2019s plan\u201d that has been endorsed by the extreme right in Israel. The families called for a British personnel presence at border crossings to ensure agile inspection processes and monitor and ensure that aid flows unrestricted into Gaza. Britain has repeatedly been denied a diplomatic presence on the aid crossing points, but has supplied \u00a31m in emergency aid for medical evacuees in Egypt. Israel insists aid has increased since a US warning more than a week ago that arms supplies would be blocked unless 300 aid trucks entered Gaza a day. One of the family members reflected on the meeting, saying: It is hard to talk about this collective trauma, but political leaders must hear our testimonies directly, so they understand the real-life impact of their policies. Bringing 15 children to the UK is a tiny ask compared to the 34,000 injured, and that\u2019s before even mentioning 16,000 killed and 21,000 missing. But we sadly know all too well how much difference one life saved could have been for us. This would just be a tiny drop in the ocean, but it could be the start of something more. All we can hope is that they have not just heard what we have said, but have listened. The group is organised as the British Palestinian Families Network, an informal network set up by British Palestinians with family trapped in Gaza. Anneliese Dodds, the Foreign Office minister, told MPs earlier that most British arms exported to Israel don\u2019t go to the Israeli Defence Forces, as she sought to clarify the significance of the government\u2019s decision in September to suspend only 30 of the 300 arms exports licences to Israel. Speaking in the Commons, she also described the amount of aid reaching Gaza in October as unacceptable, and likely to be the lowest amount for a single month since the conflict began. But she did not set out any specific measures apart from diplomatic pressure to ensure a change. In what the minister saw as a clarification, she told MPs: Following the 2 September decision there are currently no extant UK export licences for items to Israel that we assess might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of UK humanitarian law. She said the only one exception is UK supplied components for F35s joint strike fighter program. She added: Most licences for exports to Israel are absolutely not for the Israeli Defence Forces and I am pleased to put that on the record. She added later there had been misconceptions about the arms exports that have not been suspended. At the time of the September statement the Foreign Office said: There are a number of export licences which we have assessed are not for military use in the current conflict in Gaza and therefore do not require suspension. These include items that are not being used by the IDF in the current conflict (such as trainer aircraft or other naval equipment), and other, non-military items. Export licences cover a range of products including things such as food-testing chemicals, telecoms and data equipment. The Foreign Office has so far refused to publish a list of the suspended and non-suspended arms export licences, or their customers. The Howard League for Penal Reform has issued a statement welcoming the sentencing review announced today. Andrea Coomber, its chief executive, said: The trend of imposing ever longer sentences has brought the criminal justice system to the brink. An independent review presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver a more humane and effective response to crime and a lasting solution to the capacity crisis in prisons. A group of leftwing MPs has urged Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, to include a tax on \u201cextreme wealth\u201d in the budget next week. In their letter, they call for an annual wealth tax, such as 2% on assets over \u00a310m which they say would generate \u00a324bn a year, and equalising capital gains and income tax rates, which they say could raise \u00a316.7bn a year. They argue: In recent years, billionaire wealth has soared, increasing by almost \u00a3150 billion between 2020 and 2022. Despite this, revenue from wealth taxes has remained stagnant at around 3.4% of the UK\u2019s GDP, proportionately only one percent higher than rates in 1965. This stands in contrast to other trends in the tax system, meaning that the richest are relatively under-taxed. This is deeply unfair and immoral: in an age of climate and economic crises, where public funds are desperately needed, it is necessary that we redress this imbalance. The transformative potential of taxes on extreme wealth is clear, and appetite for them is growing. Governments around the world - including Norway, Italy and Brazil - are considering fiscal measures to fairly tax the super-rich. As one of the most unequal economies in the G7, the UK should follow suit. The letter has been signed by 30 MPs and peers from Labour, the Green party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the SDLP, and Alliance, as well as independent MPs. The full list of signatories is: Adrian Ramsay, Apsana Begum, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Ben Lake, Brian Leishman, Carla Denyer, Cat Smith, Claire Hanna, Clive Lewis, Colum Eastwood, Diane Abbott, Ellie Chowns, Ian Byrne, Ian Lavery, Jeremy Corbyn, Lord (John) Hendy, John McDonnell, Jon Trickett, Kim Johnson, Liz Saville-Roberts, Nadia Whittome, Neil Duncan-Jordan, Olivia Blake, Lord Sikka, Rachel Gilmour, Richard Burgon, Si\u00e2n Berry, Sorcha Eastwood, Steve Witherden and Zarah Sultana. In her statement in the Commons Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, said that \u201cfewer than 20\u201d prisoners released under the early release scheme had been put up in hotels. This was \u201cto prevent any homelessness that might lead to higher rates of recall\u201d, she said. The cost was \u201cvery, very low\u201d, she said, adding: \u201cThis is a temporary measure, and I don\u2019t anticipate it will be used any more extensively than it has been already.\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister has said pay talks for council workers are \u201cclosed\u201d as he condemned the \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d targeting of his constituency by a trade union, PA Media reports. PA says: Unison announced two weeks of strike action by non-teacher school staff in the Perth and Kinross council area after the union voted against a new pay deal. Unite and the GMB backed the deal, which provided a 67p per hour uplift or 3.6%, whichever was higher, for staff and the deal was imposed on workers. The action has led to a number of primary schools and nurseries having to close, with Perth and Kinross council unable to conduct risk assessments during the October holidays leading to disruption at the beginning of this week. Yesterday all primary schools, nurseries, intensive support settings and two secondary schools in the area were closed. Today 11 primary schools were able to open but dozens remained shut and others only partially reopened. Speaking to the PA news agency on Tuesday, John Swinney reiterated the words of his finance secretary Shona Robison, who said on Monday there was no more money for pay deals. \u201cThere is no reopening of 2024-25 pay deals,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to have discussions about future years but this year is closed.\u201d Swinney, MSP for Perthshire North, also hit out at Unison\u2019s decision to target his area for action. \u201cWhat is utterly unacceptable for me is the fact that education in my constituency has been disrupted purely and simply because I happen to represent that area,\u201d he said. \u201cMy constituents have been singled out for treatment just because their MSP is first minister, and I find that completely unacceptable.\u201d Beaming prisoners were greeted with hugs and kisses as they stepped out of the metal gates of HMP Manchester and into the arms of waiting friends and family after being freed under the government\u2019s early release scheme, Hannah Al-Othman reports. During the Commons statement on the sentencing review, Josh Babarinde, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 justice spokesperson, asked what was being done to ensure that domestic abusers were not being released early under the government\u2019s scheme. He said: Having grown up in a home of domestic violence myself at the hands of my mum\u2019s former partner, I share the concerns of the Victims\u2019 Commissioner [Lady Newlove] and survivors of domestic abuse that loopholes in the early release scheme\u2019s criteria could mean that some of their abusers who are convicted of violent offences but not of domestic violence-specific offences, may have been released early today. Domestic abuse survivors deserve to be safe. Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, replied: There isn\u2019t a specific offence of domestic abuse within our legislative framework. In order to bring in the emergency release to prevent us running out of prison spaces in July, I have pulled every lever at my disposal. You can only make these changes in law by excluding offences, not offender cohorts or offender types. That\u2019s why that list of offences that are included includes offences that are most closely connected to domestic abuse situations, but of course it is not fully comprehensive \u2013 it cannot be. The Probation Institute, a charity promoting best practice in probation work, has welcomed the sentencing review. It posted this on social media. The Probation Institute welcomes the Sentencing Review to be led by David Gauke. Please make sure this review is genuinely about sentencing not just about prisons and focusses significantly on Probation and building resources in the community to support rehabilitation. Edward Argar, the shadow justice secretary, was responding to statement on behalf of the Conservative policy. His first job in government was as a junior justice minister, when David Gauke was justice secretary, and he told MPs that Gauke was \u201ca decent, honorable, able and thoughtful man\u201d whom he regarded as a friend. Argar said that he would not pre-judge Gauke\u2019s sentencing review, but would take a view when it was published. In his response he largely focused instead on problems with the early release scheme already implemented by the government. Danny Shaw, a former BBC home affairs correspondent and a former adviser to Labour, has said that the changes to the home detention curfew (HDC) rules announced by Shabana Mahmood (see 2.15am) amount to another version of early release. He has posted these on social media. NEW Justice Secretary @ShabanaMahmood confirms major expansion of tagging scheme Home Detention Curfew. Prisoners will be freed up to 12 months before scheduled release date - currently it\u2019s 6 months So, an offender jailed for 4 years could spend just 1 year behind bars. No hiding it: HDC is a form of early release. Number of HDC prisoners is almost 4,000 - nearly double the total a year ago... @ShabanaMahmood also confirmed plan to relax \u2018recall\u2019 rules so fewer recalled prisoners are kept in jail... These are separate measures to Gauke revew Mahmood ended her statement by saying she said she would accelerate the deportation of foreign offenders. I share the public\u2019s view that with 10,000 in our prisons, there are far too many foreign offenders in this country, costing \u00a350,000 pounds a year, each to house at His Majesty\u2019s pleasure. It happens to be my personal view that deportation is as good a punishment as imprisonment, if not better. We are currently on track to remove more foreign national offenders this year than at any time in recent years, but I will now be working with my colleagues across government to explore the ways that we can accelerate this further, including working with the Home Office to make the early removal scheme for foreign offenders more effective. Mahmood said the early release scheme already implemented by Labour would solve the overcrowding crisis for about a year. But \u201cafter the summer of disorder, the next crisis could be just nine months away\u201d, she said. She said she had already given magistrates new sentencing powers, to reduce the pressure on remand prisons where overcrowding is most accute. But she said she needed to go further. She said she would be increasing the maximum period offenders can spend on home detention curfew from six months to 12 months. She also said she would be review the risk-assessed recall review process, so that when offenders get returned to jail after a breach of their parole conditions, it will be more straightforward to clear them for release again. UPDATE: Mahmood said: The second measure that we will introduce will address the soaring recall population, which has doubled from 6,000 to 12,000 in just six years. Risk-assessed recall review is a power of the secretary of state to re-release unlicensed those who pose a low list to the public, avoiding the long waits that they often face for a parole board hearing. In recent years, its use has fallen to as low as 92 times in 2022. Later this month, I intend to review the ris- assessed recall review process so that lower risk cases can be considered for re-release after they have been recalled to prison for two to three months, where their further detention is no longer necessary to protect the public. And I should note that this will only change the cases that can be considered for release, with the final decision still in the hands of experienced probation officers and managers. Mahmood said she was glad David Gauke has agreed to lead the review. She said he had been a \u201chighly-regard minister \u2026 who has rightly gained the respect of both the judiciary and the legal sector\u201d. Mahmood said the sentencing review would be governed by three principles. First, sentences must \u201cpunish offenders and protect the public\u201d, she said. She suggested in some cases longer sentences might be preferable. For dangerous offenders, prison will always remain the answer punishment and public protection will be this government\u2019s first priority. There will also be some offenders who I will task the review with considering, like prolific offenders \u2013 who are just one in every 10 individuals, but nearly half of all sentences. Some of these are hyper-prolific offenders committing hundreds of crimes. And I will ask the reviewers to consider whether a longer sentence might punish them better and force them to engage with rehabilitation on the inside. Second, the review would look at what could be done to encourage more rehabilitation. We need both sticks and carrots in this I will be encouraging the reviewers to learn from others who have succeeded. In Texas, for instance, Republican legislators were faced by a problem similar to ours, a soaring prison population, sky-high reoffending rates and prisons that had run out of space. Working across political divide, the Texans introduced a system of good behavior credits, where well-behaved prisoners could earn time off their sentence by engaging in rehabilitation programs. The results were remarkable. Crime fell by nearly a third, reaching the lowest levels in half a century. The prison population fell by over 20,000 and after two decades, the Texans had closed 16 prisons rather than building new ones. Third, the review would have to \u201cexpand the punishment that offenders receive outside of prison\u201d, Mahmood said. There are already ways that we severely constrain offenders, limiting their freedom outside of prison. Those under home detention curfews are in practice under a form of house arrest with a tag on their ankle and a censor in their home. They are placed on the curfews, generally for 12 hours each day. Should they break that curfew, they can be picked up and if need be locked up. In some ways, punishment outside a prison can be even more restrictive than prison. It is a sad fact that in many of our prisons today a drinker can all too easily procure a drink. On a sobriety tag, however, with their sweat measured every 30 minutes and a 97% compliance rate their teetotalism is almost as strict as mine \u2026 I will be inviting the reviewers to consider the technology that they have available to them now, and also the next frontier of technology used in other countries, but not yet in ours, because I believe that the modern world presents us with the opportunity to build a prison outside of prison, where the eyes of the state follow a prisoner more closely than any prison officer can. Mahmood said that after the August bank holiday there were fewer than 100 spaces in men\u2019s prisons in England and Wales. She went on: The system was only held together by the heroic work and considerable goodwill of our prisons and probation staff, and we were, on many occasions, just one bad day from disaster. Today, the second tranche of emergency releases takes place creating desperately needed space within our prisons. But this is not the long term solution, so I will now set out the long term plan for our prisons. Mahmood said the record of the last government on building prisons was \u201cabject\u201d. While the last government promised to build 20,000 new places by the mid 2020s, by the time they left office, they had built only 6000. They were simply too terrified of their own back benchers who supported prison building vociferously \u2013 as long as those prisons were not getting built anywhere near them. But Mahmood said that the government could not just build its way out of this problem, which is why a new approach to sentencing was needed. In the Commons Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, is making her statement to MPs on the sentencing review. She says the prison overcrowding crisis was the greatest disgrace of the last government. She says they left the system \u201con the point of collapse\u201d, with prisons close to the point where they would have to stop taking new inmates, trials would have to be cancelled and the police would have to stop arresting people. During the Commons statement on the new loan to Ukraine, John Healey, the defence secretary, said the deployment of troops from North Korea in support of Russia was \u201cshocking\u201d. He said: In a concerning new development is it is now highly likely that the transfer of hundreds of combat troops from North Korea to Russia has begun. North Korean soldiers supporting Russia\u2019s war of aggression on European soil. It is as shocking as it is desperate. North Korea already sends significant munitions and arms to Russia in direct violation of multiple UN resolutions. This developing military cooperation between Russia and the DPRK has serious security implications for Europe and for the Indo Pacific. It represents a wider, growing alliance of aggression which Nato and the G7 nations must confront. John Healey, the defence secretary, has told MPs that the government is lending Ukraine an additional \u00a32.26bn which it can use to buy weapons for use to fight off the Russian invastion. Dan Sabbagh has details of the announcement here. In the Commons, Healey said the loan would be funded using profits from Russian assets that have been sanctioned, and that it would be on top of the \u00a33bn a year the UK is already giving Ukraine. He said: Loans which will be repaid using the profits generated from immobilised Russian sovereign assets. Profits on frozen Russian money supporting Ukraine\u2019s fight against [Vladimir] Putin, turning the proceeds of Putin\u2019s corrupt regime against that regime and putting it in the hands of Ukrainians. I want to be clear, today\u2019s new money is additional to the \u00a33bn a year of military support this government has committed to Ukraine each year for as long as it takes, in addition to the \u00a33.5bnn defence industrial support treaty, which I signed with Defence Minister Umerov in July, money that will be used by Ukraine to procure military equipment from British companies, boosting our British jobs and our British industry. And extra too, the additional artillery, air defences, ammunition, missiles that we have announced and delivered in the first four months of this new government. Ukraine is a first order priority for me as defence secretary. It\u2019s a first order priority for this government. We will continue to step up support. On the Today programme this morning Kirsty Buchanan, who worked as a Tory special adviser in the Ministry of Justice and Downing Street under the last government, rejected the claim that prison numbers have gone up drastically over the last 30 years because of a sentencing \u201carms race\u201d by politicians. This is the charge made by David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary who is leading a review of sentencing policy for Labour. (See 9.26am.) But Buchanan, who was a MoJ adviser when Liz Truss was justice secretary, said: When we were [at the MoJ] we took a deep dive into what the greatest drivers for prison growth were. And people may be reassured to know that this isn\u2019t that we\u2019re just locking up more people and throwing away the key. The greatest driver since the 1990s isn\u2019t a tit for tat arms race among politicians desperate to be seen to be tougher on crime than the next person. The greatest drivers are an increase in reporting and convictions to serious sexual offenses. So that\u2019s rape, domestic violence, rape of a minor, and robbery. They\u2019re all violent crimes. And, actually, we are sentencing more people for those, and we are sentencing them for longer. The prison population itself has remained relatively stable since about 2010, around 85,000. But [since] the 1990s the huge surge, that extra 20,000 people that we send to prison, I think we can all agree they really need to be there. They are very serious offenders. Suella Braverman was criticised in the Commons today for complaining that Labour has not proscribed Iran\u2019s IRGC (Islamic Republican Guard Corps) when she did not do that as home secretary. During Foreign Office questions, Braverman said Labour had been promising the proscribe the IRGC, \u201cthe chief sponsor of global terrorism\u201d, for years. She went on: Is the government going to take action to tackle terrorism and extremism in the UK, or is the government going to break yet another promise? Hamish Falconer, a Foreign Office minister, replied: As I understand the question from the former home secretary, she\u2019s saying when she was the home secretary, she did not proscribe the IRGC. She thinks we should now within 100 days. We will take the necessary action in the UK to prevent the IRGC from taking action on these streets, but we do not comment as she knows well, on whether or not an organisation is under consideration for proscription in the normal way. Keir Starmer \u201cshares the public\u2019s anger\u201d at the sight of prisoners being released early today, Downing Street said this morning. But the last government is to blame, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson suggested, because without the early release scheme there would be \u201ccomplete paralysis\u201d of the criminal justice system. Commenting on the latest batch of early prisoner releases, the spokesperson told journalists at the lobby briefing this morning: The prime minister shares the public\u2019s anger at these scenes and thinks it is shocking that any government should ever inherit the crisis that this government has when it comes to our prisons. But just to be clear, there was no choice not to act. If we had not acted, we would have faced a complete paralysis of the system. Courts unable to send offenders to prison, police unable to make arrests and unchecked criminality on our streets, so the government clearly could not allow this to happen. Voters will judge the Labour government to be a failure if it keeps its promises to be responsible on government borrowing and tax, but fails to improve public services, according to polling research published today. The left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has published a very detailed report exploring what voters say about how they would assess the record of the Labour government in 2029, depending on what it has achieved by then. The results suggest that voters care a lot more about seeing NHS waiting lists halved, public services getting better and infrastracture improved than they do about government borrowing and debt coming down, or taxes not going up. This is particularly the case with people who switched to Labour at the last election. And people would even be happy to see Labour break its promise on national insurance if NHS waiting lists halved as a result, the polling suggests. The IPPR says in its summary: We found that Labour government which is perceived to have delivered on its \u2018tax, borrowing and spending promises\u2019 but failed to deliver change in public services will be judged a failure and punished by voters. This is especially crucial for voters who switched to Labour in 2024. Among general election 2024 switchers to Labour, a scenario in which government debt and deficits have been reduced but NHS waiting lists are unchanged leads to a government approval rating of -12, a fall of 28 percentage points from current approval ratings with switchers. Instead, the public prefer the government to borrow more, find additional tax revenues (within their rules) and deliver on change - with a particular focus on public services. A scenario where waiting lists are halved \u2013 even at the expense of debt or taxes rising \u2013 leads to a +31 approval rating with this group, 15 percentage points higher than now. Similar results are found seen for Conservative to Labour switchers. Steve Akehurst from Persuasion UK, a research company that worked with the IPPR on the report, said: It\u2019s clear from this research that voters will not reward Labour simply for being good stewards of the economy. The public wants to see tangible improvements in essential services. Key parts of Labour\u2019s coalition do not necessarily like the idea of higher borrowing or tax, but they seem willing to forgive it as the price of improved services. The funeral of Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister who died suddenly earlier this month after delivering a speech in North Macedonia, will be held on Tuesday 29 October, his family has announced. The funeral will be at Strichen parish church in Aberdeenshire. It will be conducted by Rev Ian McEwan, a friend of the family, and only family and close friends are invited. Salmond will be laid to rest in Strichen cemetery. A public memorial service will be held at a later date. On the Today programme this morning Nick Robinson talked about Britain being \u201cthe European leader in locking people up\u2019\u201d. (See 9.26am.) According to this briefing paper from the Commons library, published this summer but using Eurostat data from 2017, England and Wales are top \u2013 but only for Western Europe. It says: According to the Eurostat data, England and Wales had 144 prisoners per 100,000 head of population, the 8th highest rate among EU countries and the highest amongst western European jurisdictions. Scotland had the 9th highest with 137 prisoners per 100,000. Northern Ireland had 76 prisoners per 100,000 of population and was ranked 24th. Last week Michael Gove, the former cabinet minister and Kemi Badenoch ally, said that Robert Jenrick would not be ideal as party leader because he looked like a \u201cTory boy\u201d. In an interview with BBC Breakfast this morning, Jenrick hit back. As the Mirror reports, when asked about the jibe, Jenrick said: Well, the last person I would take advice from in a leadership contest I think is Michael Gove \u2026 I don\u2019t know what [Tory boy] really means \u2026 I didn\u2019t come from a traditional Conservative background. Neither of my parents were card carrying members of the Conservative party \u2026 I don\u2019t consider myself to be a \u2018Tory boy.\u2019 I want the Conservative party to be the trade union of working people right across this country. Suella Braverman, the former Tory home secretary, has put a post on social media explaining why she is backing Robert Jenrick for party leader. I\u2019m supporting @RobertJenrick to be the next leader of the Conservative Party. We need to rebuild trust on one of the defining issues of our age: the global migration crisis. Robert\u2019s unequivocal commitment to leaving the ECHR and placing a cap on visas is how we start. In a separate development, William Hague, a former leader of the party, has used his Times column to say, \u201cafter hesitating for a while\u201d, he has decided to back Kemi Badenoch. He explains: While Jenrick has set out a series of very specific commitments, most notably on immigration and leaving the European convention on human rights, Badenoch has rightly resisted the pressure to do so. She seems to know instinctively what I wish I had worked out before I became opposition leader in 1997: that before voters will pay any attention to the policies you announce, they need to understand your values. Badenoch\u2019s insistence that principles rather than policies are the starting point for political revival is correct. It is borne out by the experience of the more successful opposition leaders in recent history, from Churchill to Thatcher. Her chosen values of truth, personal responsibility, active citizenship, equality under the law and family \u2013 in the broadest, modern sense of family \u2013 are strong foundations on which to rethink policies over several years. And her emphatic view that the processes of government need to be re-engineered to achieve anything significant is also spot on. Add in her pugnacious personality and it is possible to discern the combination of values and energy that could yet lift the Conservative party up from the electoral floor. The Treasury has said it will need to take difficult decisions in next week\u2019s budget after higher debt interest payments and pay awards for public sector workers pushed government borrowing to \u00a316.6bn last month \u2013 the third highest September figure on record, Larry Elliott reports. As Pippa Crerar reports, yesterday it emerged that Suella Braverman forwarded government documents to her private email accounts at least 127 times while serving as attorney general, in a potential breach of the ministerial code. This morning, in an interview with LBC, the former home secretary and former attorney general said that what she did was \u201cnot particularly unusual\u201d and that there was a \u201ctedious\u201d explanation for it. She said she was not transferring \u201csensitive\u201d material to her private email account and that she only emailed government documents to that account because she wanted to use two laptops at the same time when working from home during Covid. Braverman said that, as a minister, she was not allowed to use her government email account on her personal laptop. She had to use her government email on her ministerial laptop. She said that she was allowed to take her ministerial laptop home, but that during Covid, when she was working at home a lot, she wanted to have two screens on the go at the same time. When the presenter, Nick Ferrari, asked her why she did not just use her ministerial laptop, Braverman replied: But that\u2019s not very practical when you are reading a lot of documents online and you simultaneously need to write lengthy documents and pieces as part of your work. Sometimes you need two screens. So it\u2019s a bit tedious as an explanation. There\u2019s nothing to do with spies or state secrets here \u2026 There was nothing sensitive that was transferred. It was literally a way to enable me to view documents on one screen and simultaneously type on another screen so that I could explain my views those people. Ferrari did not ask Braverman why she could not just use a split screen function on her laptop. Asked if she would do it again, Braverman replied: Listen, I was never actually advised that that was not permissible, and we were in a strange scenario where a lot of that was done during Covid and lockdown, when there was a lot of working from home, and I wasn\u2019t getting as many papers in physical copy. And she claimed that what she did was not particularly unusual. Asked why other ministers did not also get into trouble for using personal email addresses for ministerial business, she said: If you look back at the records, there have been some of my colleagues who have been found to be using their personal emails many years ago. I\u2019m not going to name any names. But you can find that out as well. So it\u2019s not particularly unusual, I would say, amongst ministers. The revelation about Braverman forwarding government documents to her personal email account at least 127 times came out after an 18-month Freedom of Information Act inquiry from the Times newspaper resulted in a tribunal ordering disclosure of the information. The paper was particularly interested in Braverman\u2019s record in this area because when she was home secretary under Liz Truss she was forced to resign because she forwarded an unpublished government document deemed sensitive to a backbench Tory MP. In her LBC interview, Braverman also said she was backing Robert Jenrick for next Tory leader because he was committed to leaving the European convention on human rights. Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, has said that mistakes that affected the first set of early prisoner releases under Labour should have been \u201cironed out\u201d ahead of the second round take place today. In an interview with Times Radio, she said that 37 prisoners were released by mistake when around 1,700 inmates were released early in September. She went on: All 37 were returned to custody, and that operational part of the system actually ended up working exactly as it should. But those mistakes have now been ironed out, and I\u2019m confident that the releases taking place will now be exactly as we need them to be, and victims who are required to be notified will be notified. Mahmood also said that the rates of recall for prisoners released early were \u201cbroadly in line\u201d with usual prison releases. Speaking on LBC, she said: We\u2019ll do a statistics release in due course, as we normally would, on rates of recall and on reoffending in our prison estate. What I can tell you is our early assessment is that the rates of recall and potential reoffending in the cohort that has been released as a result of the emergency release measures is broadly in line with what we would expect. Paul Brand from ITV says, if the government thinks that, by getting David Gauke to carry out the sentencing review, they will get the Conservatives support for it, they will probably be disappointed. He has posted this on social media. Govt hopes by appointing Gauke - a former Tory Justice Sec (tho admittedly a centrist in today\u2019s party) - they can get cross-party agreement on sentencing reform. But it\u2019s likely Tory leadership candidates will say Labour being soft on criminals, and on the political debate goes. Good morning. Michael Howard was Conservative leader at one point, and was instrumental in ensuring that David Cameron succeeded him in that job, but perhaps he will be best remembered for his time as home secretary in the 1990s, when he gave a speech that summed up criminal justice policy for the next three decades. He told the Tory conference: Prison works. It ensures that we are protected from murderers, muggers and rapists - and it makes many who are tempted to commit crime think twice \u2026 This may mean that more people will go to prison. I do not flinch from that. We shall no longer judge the success of our system of justice by a fall in our prison population. And, around that time, the prison population in England and Wales started to soar. The election of a Labour government did not make any difference to this trend; Howardism prevailed. Today, is that all going to change? As Rajeev Syal reports in our overnight story, to coincide with the 1,100 more criminals being let out as part of the early release policy introduced by Labour to deal with the jail overcrowding crisis, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, is announcing a review of sentencing policy, which will be carried out by David Gauke, the former Conservative justice secretary. It will consider alternatives to sending people to jail. The Ministry of Justice\u2019s press release about the review is here. And the terms of refererence are here. Mahmood has been giving interviews this morning and it has been notable that she has not been declaring war on the Michael Howard approach. The Ministry of Justice says that one of the principles behind the sentencing review is to \u201cmake sure prison sentences punish serious offenders and protect the public\u201d and it says the government is committed to creating 14,000 more prison places. Although the review will consider \u201ctougher punishments outside of prison\u201d, the terms of reference also imply sentences should go up for offences against women and girls. On the Today programme this morning Nick Robinson asked Mahmood to clarify how radical she was being. Did she just want to curb the rate at which the prison population was going up? Or did she want fewer people to be jailed, and Britain to stop being \u201cthe European leader in locking people up\u201d? In her reply, Mahmood rather fudged it, implying she wanted both. She said: Well, the problem is that the rate of increase is such that nobody can keep up with demand, and you risk running out of prison places \u2026 We reach critical capacity again by next summer. We cannot build our way out of this crisis. To put it in context, I have HMP Birmingham in my constituency. That\u2019s a very large, older Victorian prison. It has a capacity of over 1,000. We need to build nearly five of those every single year to keep up with demand. So we do have to manage demand into the prison system. But for a period it\u2019s obvious that demand is going to go up, because we are going to have to build those 14,000 places. If we don\u2019t, we run out of prison places earlier than we would expect. The crisis is so acute that all of these things, building more supply, dealing with demand, have to be part of the solution. But in the end, the sentencing review is our best opportunity to set a new trajectory where we can manage that demand, where I can make sure we never run out of prison places again, where there is a prison place for everyone who needs to be locked up, and where we expand the range of punishments outside of prison. But Gauke himself has been a bit more willing to denounce Howardism. He has written an article for the New Statesman about the sentencing review and he says he wants to use it to end the \u201csentencing bidding war\u201d between political parties. He says: For the last 30 years, there has been a sentencing bidding war between the political parties seeking to compete to be seen as the toughest on crime by promising ever-longer prison sentences. Rightly, the public expects criminality to be punished and prison is often viewed as the only effective means of punishment. But the capacity crisis in our prisons has meant that \u2013 at the very least \u2013 we have no choice but to pause the increase in the prison population. It is also sensible that we now look more broadly at the evidence and ask whether sentencing policy should be more fundamentally reformed. By next spring, we should have the answer. There will be a lot more on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Keir Starmer chairs cabinet. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 12.30pm: Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, makes a statement to MPs about the sentencing review. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I\u2019m still using X and I\u2019ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian). I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct). And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

Salis was arrested in Budapest in February 2023 after a counter-demonstration against a neo-Nazi rally, and charged with three counts of attempted assault and membership of an extreme leftwing organisation.

      "body": "<p>The defining event in the singing career of Paul Di\u2019Anno \u2013 and one whose influence he never managed to escape \u2013 was his departure from the London-based heavy metal band Iron Maiden in 1981. </p> <p>Having joined in 1978, Di\u2019Anno recorded an EP and two pioneering albums with the group, but disputes with the bandleader Steve Harris over musical direction, as well as his own unreliable behaviour, led the group to fire him. </p> <p>The shadow of Iron Maiden lingered over Di\u2019Anno, who has died aged 66, for the next 40 years, with a sequence of briefly successful projects mostly alluding to his former membership of one of the world\u2019s biggest bands. After his departure he quickly descended into a chaotic lifestyle blighted by substance abuse.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re fucked up on drugs and alcohol you turn into a complete prick,\u201d he admitted while promoting his 2010 autobiography, The Beast, which included endless tales of drunken aggression, unpleasantly graphic encounters with groupies and confrontations with gang members and police officers, as well as incidents of domestic violence. One of these led to a prison sentence in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, after he assaulted a girlfriend with a knife while high on cocaine.</p> <p>Di\u2019Anno was born Paul Andrews in Chingford, Essex, to a Brazilian father and an English mother: he also used the surname Taylor after his mother remarried.

      "bodyText": "The defining event in the singing career of Paul Di\u2019Anno \u2013 and one whose influence he never managed to escape \u2013 was his departure from the London-based heavy metal band Iron Maiden in 1981. Having joined in 1978, Di\u2019Anno recorded an EP and two pioneering albums with the group, but disputes with the bandleader Steve Harris over musical direction, as well as his own unreliable behaviour, led the group to fire him. The shadow of Iron Maiden lingered over Di\u2019Anno, who has died aged 66, for the next 40 years, with a sequence of briefly successful projects mostly alluding to his former membership of one of the world\u2019s biggest bands. After his departure he quickly descended into a chaotic lifestyle blighted by substance abuse. \u201cWhen you\u2019re fucked up on drugs and alcohol you turn into a complete prick,\u201d he admitted while promoting his 2010 autobiography, The Beast, which included endless tales of drunken aggression, unpleasantly graphic encounters with groupies and confrontations with gang members and police officers, as well as incidents of domestic violence. One of these led to a prison sentence in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, after he assaulted a girlfriend with a knife while high on cocaine. Di\u2019Anno was born Paul Andrews in Chingford, Essex, to a Brazilian father and an English mother: he also used the surname Taylor after his mother remarried. As a teenager he worked as a butcher and chef while singing with a punk band, supposedly called the Paedophiles. His break came when he met Harris in 1978 at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone and auditioned for Iron Maiden, which Harris had founded three years previously.

The UN said the income loss caused by the restrictions and military operations was \u201cstaggering\u201d. \u201cAccording to thorough estimations described in the present report, in the absence of those constraints, by the end of 2023 it is estimated that Gaza\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) would have been, on average, 77.6% higher than its actual level. \u201cThis implies a conservatively estimated cumulative loss of $35.8bn of unrealised GDP potential during the period 2007\u20132023 \u2013 equivalent to 17 times the GDP of Gaza in 2023.\u201d In the first three-quarters of 2023 \u2013 before the war began \u2013 the Gazan economy was contracting at an annual rate of about 3%. It contracted by 22.6% in 2023 as a whole, with 90% of that drop coming in the fourth quarter. The report said that, by the end of July 2024, 88% of school buildings had suffered some damage, 21 out of 36 hospitals were out of service and 45 out of 105 primary health facilities were non-operational. More than 62% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed, and more than 59% of the water, sanitation and hygiene sector infrastructure was heavily damaged, with an impact on water and sanitation services. Unctad said in the fourth quarter of 2023, Gaza registered its largest economic slump in recent history. GDP contracted by 80.8% compared with the third quarter of 2023, while GDP a head fell by 81.4% over the same period. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 October 2024 to refer to more than 1,200 people killed on 7 October; an earlier version said more than 1,000.",

      "bodyText": "The convicted breast surgeon Ian Paterson pitched one of his patients an unauthorised cleavage-sparing mastectomy \u201calmost like a sales job\u201d, an inquest has heard. Chloe Nikitas, an environmental consultant from Tamworth, died in 2008 at the age of 43 from breast cancer that returned three years after having a mastectomy she believed had removed all of her breast tissue. She is the first of 62 patients operated on by Paterson whose deaths are being investigated as part of one of the largest inquests in British history, to find out whether the surgeon\u2019s actions caused their deaths. Paterson, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted of multiple counts of wounding in 2017, refused to attend Nikitas\u2019s inquest on Tuesday. A prison supervisor told the hearing he had a 20-minute conversation with Paterson on Tuesday morning, in which the 66-year-old former surgeon said the \u201ccoroner isn\u2019t investigating fairly\u201d, he felt he wasn\u2019t being \u201clistened to\u201d and the proceedings were \u201cbiased\u201d. Judge Foster, who is leading the inquests, can impose a fine of up to \u00a31,000, refer Paterson for possible prosecution or refer him to the attorney general for contempt of court. He said he would reserve his judgment in the hope Paterson would change his mind and attend future inquests. \u201cIt is a disappointment to me, but more importantly to the bereaved families who have questions that need answering,\u201d he said. Nikitas\u2019s partner of 18 years, Klaus Str\u00f6hle, told the inquest how the couple had trusted Paterson, who told them he had \u201cpioneered\u201d a new type of surgery that would preserve the appearance of her cleavage after the breast tissue removal. \u201cIt was almost like a sales job \u2013 this is the latest new thing he has developed, and there\u2019s nothing to worry about, it\u2019s going to be great,\u201d said Str\u00f6hle. \u201cWe just assumed this was the new state of the art methodology.

We assumed this was the best course of action.\u201d Nikitas was offered no alternative type of operation, he said. Cleavage-sparing mastectomies, as they were later named by Paterson, were not a recognised or authorised type of operation. They involved leaving some breast tissue behind, instead of completely removing it as was standard procedure in a mastectomy. Nikitas was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 after noticing discomfort in her left breast while breastfeeding her young son.

Last week, Canadian police made the explosive accusation that Indian diplomats had worked with a criminal network led by a notorious imprisoned gangster to target Sikh dissidents in the country through a string of arsons, extortion schemes, drive-by shootings and at least two murders. Earlier this year, police reached out to Malik\u2019s son with a \u201cduty to warn\u201d, over fears there was a credible threat against his life. In a statement following the guilty pleas, Malik\u2019s family said the result brought \u201cmixed emotions\u201d. \u201cThe weeks leading up to the scheduled trial has brought the trauma of our loss to the forefront. While we are grateful that the shooters are being brought to justice, we know that nothing will erase the pain that we have gone through losing a family member in this way,\u201d the statement said. \u201c[The Royal Canadian Mounted police and prosecution service]\u2019s hard work has resulted in some justice for our family. However, the work is not complete. Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez were hired to commit this murder. Until the parties responsible for hiring them and directing this assassination are brought to justice, the work remains incomplete.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has arrived in Israel to encourage efforts to revive the stalled Gaza ceasefire negotiations after Israel\u2019s killing of the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, last week. Meeting the Israeli prime minister, Blinken urged Benjamin Netanyahu to capitalise on the death of the Hamas leader by securing the release of the 7 October attack hostages and ending the conflict in Gaza. A US state department spokesperson added that Blinken had also emphasised to Netanyahu on the need for Israel to boost humanitarian assistance into Gaza, during a two-and-a-half-hour meeting in Jerusalem on Tuesday. Blinken, who has made multiple fruitless trips to the region, arrived to little evidence that either Israel or Hamas were open to movement on their preconditions for a ceasefire in Gaza, where more than a year of an Israeli offensive has claimed more than 42,000 Palestinian lives. With the US election just two weeks away, the US president, Joe Biden, asked Blinken to return to press for progress, seeing new hope after Israel\u2019s killing of Sinwar With war raging in Gaza and also with Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the prospect of a widening conflict with Iran, international diplomats have struggled not only with the specific issues involved in trying to bring the individual wars to an end but also how to sequence issues related to the connected conflicts. The state department said before the visit that Blinken would focus on ending the war in Gaza, securing the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and alleviating the suffering of Palestinian civilians. After Israel, he is expected to visit a number of Arab countries, likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Blinken\u2019s meeting came as it was confirmed that a Hezbollah drone had struck Netanyahu\u2019s house in the Israeli seaside town of Caesarea on Saturday causing physical damage to the property. Netanyahu was not at the property at the time. According to a report on the Axios website, there has been a suggestion from Egypt, a key interlocutor with Hamas, of a much-truncated ceasefire-for-hostages deal under which living Israeli hostages would be released in exchange for a ceasefire lasting a few days, in the hope that it could help break the deadlock. Israel and Hamas accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands over the summer and negotiations ground to a halt in August. The conflicts began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. About 100 of the captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Blinken\u2019s arrival follows hard on the heels of that of the US special envoy, Amos Hochstein, in Beirut, seeking to advance discussions on a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. The state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken would underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by US law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian aid continue to be hindered. Blinken\u2019s previous trips yielded little in the way of ending hostilities but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past. The US, Egypt and Qatar have brokered months of talks between Israel and Hamas, trying to strike a deal in which the militants would release dozens of hostages in return for an end to the war, a lasting ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On top of the concerns over the continued Israeli offensives in Gaza and Lebanon is the expectation that Israel will soon launch its retaliation for last month\u2019s substantial Iranian ballistic missile strike, which targeted a number of Israeli military sites in retaliation for Israel\u2019s killing of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. With leaked US intelligence suggesting that a response might be imminent, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has been crisscrossing the region in recent days to try to build support. Speaking in Kuwait on Tuesday, he said Gulf Arab countries had assured him they would not allow their territory \u2013 including airspace \u2013 to be used for any Israeli attack. \u201cAll the neighbours assured us that they will not allow their lands and air to be used against Iran,\u201d Araghchi said, according to the state-run Irna news agency. Gulf Arab nations such as the UAE and Qatar host major military installations, and there are concerns that an all-out regional war could draw them in. Iran has repeatedly vowed to respond to any Israeli strike. Adding impetus to the calls for progress on a ceasefire on Tuesday was the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency, which called for a temporary truce to allow people to leave areas of northern Gaza, as health officials said they were running out of supplies to treat patients hurt in a renewed three-week-old Israeli offensive in the north of the coastal strip. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, said the humanitarian situation had reached a dire point, with bodies abandoned by roadsides or buried under rubble. \u201cIn northern Gaza, people are just waiting to die. They feel deserted, hopeless and alone,\u201d he said in a statement on X. \u201cI am calling for an immediate truce, even if for a few hours, to enable safe humanitarian passage for families who wish to leave the area &amp; reach safer places.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ireland\u2019s prime minister has questioned how an eight-year-old boy who may have been killed up to two years ago could have disappeared without being noticed in a case he described as \u201cutterly horrifying\u201d. Police have taken the unusual step of opening a murder investigation even though no body has been found in the case of Kyran Durnin, who was reported missing along with his mother on 30 August. Detectives said they were told the pair were last seen two days previously. The boy\u2019s mother has since been located, but police said there was no sign of the child and he was presumed dead. \u201cDespite extensive enquiries \u2026 Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police) have been unable to either locate Kyran, identify any information on his current whereabouts or any evidence that he is currently alive. \u201cFollowing enquiries to date investigating Garda\u00ed now believe that Kyran is missing, presumed dead,\u201d the police said, appealing for anyone who has any information that might be connected to the case to contact them. Police believe he may have disappeared two years ago and said he was known to have been a pupil at a local school until \u201capproximately the end of the 2021/2022 primary school year\u201d. After obtaining a court order, they began a forensic search of the home and adjacent grounds in Dundalk where Kyran had previously lived. The case has caused shockwaves across Ireland with the taoiseach, Simon Harris, describing it as \u201cdeeply disturbing, deeply upsetting\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cFor any of us as a human being, for any of us parents, to think that a child can effectively disappear and go unnoticed \u2026 is utterly heartbreaking and clearly something went extraordinarily wrong here. This child was failed and was failed badly,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHow was this child failed? How could an eight year old little boy effectively disappear and not be noticed?\u201d Police have stressed that the current tenants of the red-brick terrace house in Dundalk being searched \u201care not connected in any way with Kyran or his disappearance\u201d. The property was the home of the boy\u2019s family until May this year. They said they were conducting a forensic search of the house, the garden and adjoining open ground \u201cto discover any evidence which might provide\u201d information about what happened to the child. Speaking outside Dundalk Garda station, Ch Supt Alan McGovern said police were \u201cliaising closely\u201d with other state agencies including the child protection agency, Tusla. In a statement, Tusla said that while Kyran was not in their care, its services had engaged with his family with \u201csignificant concern\u201d raised in August 2024. \u201cSince August, we have continued to assist and work closely with the Gardai, and in line with normal practice, all relevant information has been shared,\u201d it said. The justice minister, Helen McEntee, described the case last week as \u201cdevastating\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately the view is that he is most likely dead and has passed away, but we need to understand what\u2019s happened. \u201cWe need to know have there been failures here, where have those failures been taking taking place, but also who is responsible for them. \u201cI am absolutely adamant if there were failing here, they need to be addressed and people need to be held accountable.\u201d",

Markets have bought heavily into the idea that central banks will get policy just right, engineering a return of inflation to targets without a recession. That may be true in the US, it looks less clearcut for the eurozone.</p> <p>The second risk is that the war in the Middle East escalates and leads to a sharp increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/15/oil-price-falls-china-middle-east-brent-crude-opec\">oil prices.</a> So far, commodity markets have been relaxed about the heightened tension because they see no immediate danger of crude supplies being cut off, but that could rapidly change. Gourinchas said: \u201cAn escalation in regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, could pose serious risks for commodity markets.\u201d It is a warning worth heeding.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019s the elephant in the room \u2013 the possibility that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> will return to the White House after next month\u2019s US presidential election. While not mentioning the former president by name, the IMF estimates that a shift towards \u201cundesirable\u201d industrial and trade policies could reduce global GDP by 0.5 percentage points in 2026.</p> <p>As far as the IMF is concerned, imposing trade barriers and subsidising domestic industry provides a sugar rush but the measures often lead to retaliation and fail to improve living standards in the longer term.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up: here are today\u2019s main stories. Firstly, on the IMF\u2019s annual meetings in Washington DC today: The UK public finances\u2026 And also: The IMF has identified three risks to its forecast for 3.2% global growth in the next two years, my colleague Larry Elliott writes: First, there\u2019s a risk that central banks will be too slow in reducing borrowing costs, leading to slower growth and a reassessment by financial markets of their Goldilocks scenario for the global economy. Markets have bought heavily into the idea that central banks will get policy just right, engineering a return of inflation to targets without a recession. That may be true in the US, it looks less clearcut for the eurozone. The second risk is that the war in the Middle East escalates and leads to a sharp increase in oil prices. So far, commodity markets have been relaxed about the heightened tension because they see no immediate danger of crude supplies being cut off, but that could rapidly change. Gourinchas said: \u201cAn escalation in regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, could pose serious risks for commodity markets.\u201d It is a warning worth heeding. Finally, there\u2019s the elephant in the room \u2013 the possibility that Donald Trump will return to the White House after next month\u2019s US presidential election. While not mentioning the former president by name, the IMF estimates that a shift towards \u201cundesirable\u201d industrial and trade policies could reduce global GDP by 0.5 percentage points in 2026. As far as the IMF is concerned, imposing trade barriers and subsidising domestic industry provides a sugar rush but the measures often lead to retaliation and fail to improve living standards in the longer term. After a flurry of warnings from the IMF this afternoon, London\u2019s stock markets have closed slightly lower. The FTSE 100 share index has ended the day down 11.7 points, or 0.14%, at 8306 points. Many European markets clawed back their earlier losses, with France\u2019s CAC and Spain\u2019s IBEX finishing the day flat. The IMF has also voiced concerns about the drive to encourage pension funds to invesst in riskier assets. Its new Global Financial Stability Report outlines how encouraging investment in illiquid assets heightens the risk of market instability. The IMF is concerned that the increased investment in illiquid private equity and credit in recent years by pension funds is creating a growing \u201cliquidity mismatch\u201d \u2013 because pension fund holders could want access to their money quickly, but some underlying assets would take longer to sell. This could force funds to sell more liquid assets, it explains: Furthermore, liquidity stress could spill over to financial markets, especially those markets in which pension funds and insurers have a large footprint, such as government bonds, equities, and corporate bonds. The Fund cites former chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s drive to encourage defined-contribution pension schemes to boost investment in unlisted UK equities. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has thrown her backing behind fair trade, in a pushback against the threat of more protectionism in the US. In an interview with Bloomberg, Lagarde was reminded that Donald Trump recently said that \u2018tariffs\u2019 was his favourite word. Lagarde, though, insists that the US has thrived thanks to free trade. She says: Fair trade is a key boost for growth, for employment, for innovation, for productivity. It is something that we should not throw away. Lagarde adds that the times in history when the US has thrived were periods of trade, not periods of \u201cI\u2019m going to retire behind my boundaries and play at home\u201d. The IMF has also warned that vulnerabilities are building up in the financial system, as markets may be underestimating the risks from conflict and upcoming elections. In its latest Global Financial Stability Report, the Fund flags that there is a \u201cwidening disconnect\u201d between \u201celevated economic uncertainty \u2014 stemming from ongoing military conflicts and the uncertain future policies of newly elected governments\u201d and the low volatility in the financial markets. In a warning note, the Fund reminds investors of the brief plunge in market values less than three months ago, saying: Market turmoil in early August, though short-lived, served as a reminder of how quickly volatility can catch up to uncertainty, force the unwinding of leveraged trades, and trigger feedback loops between asset prices and deleveraging. The IMF has also warned that it is very concerned about rising trade protectionism, at a time when a possible Donald Trump presidency looms over the global economy. Chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas tells reporters in Washington DC that there has been a very sharp increase in the number of trade-distorting measures implemented by countries over the last five years, from 1,000 in 2019 to 3,000 today. The IMF has calculated the impact of rising trade tensions, leading to a permanent increase in tariffs starting in mid-2025 and affecting a sizable swath of global trade. This, it says, would cut 0.8% off global GDP in 2025, and another 1.3% in 2026. Gourinchas says: There is definitely a direction of travel here that we are very concerned about, because a lot of these trade-distorting measures could reflect decisions by countries that are self-centred and could be ultimately harmful not only to the global economy\u2026 but also hurful for the countries who implement them as well. The impact on global trade also makes the residents of a country [implementing tariffs] poorer. [Reminder, Trump has proposed a 10% across-the-board levy on all products imported into the U.S. from overseas.] Back in Washington DC, the IMF\u2019s chief economist has warned that the monetary stimulus measures annouced by China won\u2019t lift growth in a material way. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas explained that today\u2019s growth forecasts don\u2019t incorporate the new fiscal stimulus measures announced by the People\u2019s Bank of China. However, he suggests that are not sufficient to lift China\u2019s growth rate significantly. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is also in the US to attend the IMF\u2019s Annual Meeting, and warning against complacency over the risk of financial crises. Speaking at the Bloomberg Global Regulatory Forum in New York, Bailey channels mythological Greek Cassandra \u2013 whose warnings were accurate, but ignored. Bailey explains: As a previous financial crisis recedes over time, it is not unusual to believe that a new era has arrived. In such conditions, Cassandra like warnings that nothing basic has changed and there is a financial breaking point that can have severe economic consequences are ignored. He also cites economics professor Hyman Minsky, who explained that the growth phase of a cycle in credit markets or business activity will end with a sudden, major collapse of asset values (A \u2018Minsky moment\u2019). Bailey explains that memories of financial crises recede over time and can be replaced by happier thoughts of a new era arriving. Warning against \u2018the trap of complacency\u2019, Bailey says: I can observe this happening with the global financial crisis fifteen years or so on. I do get people telling me that \u2018you have solved that one so we can relax\u2019. But the work I set out above on theory and history is timeless. So, let\u2019s not fall into the trap of complacency. To combat these risks, Bailey says, regulators need better surveillance tools \u2013 particularly to keep track of the non-bank sector, which he calls \u201cvery large, and growing\u201d [these are companies who offer similar services to banks, but aren\u2019t actually banks] And he wraps up with five messages on how to ensure financial stability, starting with the importance of macro-prudential regulation (rather than just a list of potential problems]. System-wide matters and should not disappear amid laundry lists. Second, we must heed Minsky\u2019s warning that memories of financial crises past do recede. Message three is that we have seen a shift in financial intermediation towards non-banks \u2013 from money to finance if you like and this presents distinct challenges. Message four is that one of these challenges is the pressing need for new surveillance tools. And message five is that there is also a need for central banks to reconsider their liquidity provision tools to non-banks while not undermining the singleness and uniqueness of money. The IMF\u2019s chief economist has warned that countries such as the UK are treading a \u201cnarrow path\u201d as they try to bring debt levels down. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas has been asked about Rachel Reeves\u2019s plans to change the UK\u2019s fiscal rule, to allow more investment in the budget, and about the risks of making too dramatic a change in fiscal policies. He tells the press pack in Washington that the IMF will evaluate the details of the budget once Rachel Reeves has given it, rather than giving judgement now. But he then says that the \u201cbroader question\u201d is relevant for many countries, not just UK, who are treading a \u201cnarrow path in terms of fiscal consolidation\u201d. Gourinchas explains that when countries have elevated debt levels, when interest rates are high, when growth is \u201cOK but not great\u201d, there is a risk that \u201cthings could escalate or get out of control quickly\u201d. He says: So there is a need to bring debt levels down, stabilise then when they are not stabilised, and rebuild fiscal buffers. That is true for many countries around the world. Countries who don\u2019t do that will later find themselves \u201cthe mercy of market pressures\u201d that will force an uncontrolled adjustment, Gourinchas warns, adding: At which point you have very few degrees of freedom. You don\u2019t want to get in that position, and the effort to stabilise public debt has to be seen in that contect. But\u2026.the other side of the narrow path is that if governments try to do too much too quickly on tax and spending they will have an adverse impact on growth. There is a need for caution, Gourinchas argues, as many countries have essential spending, such as healthcare, investment or on the climate transition. He says: We need to protect the kind of spending that can be good for growth. And he concludes by explaining that achieving this \u201cpivot\u201d is absolutely essential. \u201cWe are in a world where there will be more shocks, and countries need to be prepared and need to have some room on the fiscal side to deal with that. The IMF has lifted its growth forecast for the US this year, but trimmed its forecast for China. It now predicts US GDP will rise by 2.8% this year and 2.2% in 2025, up from 2.6% and 1.9% forecast in July. China\u2019s growth forecast for 2024, though, has been cut to 4.8%, down from 5%. The IMF are presenting their new World Economic Outlook report in Washington DC now \u2013 you can watch it here: The IMF is sticking with its forecast for 3.2% global growth this year, although predicted growth in 2025 has been revised down from 3.3% to 3.2%. Here\u2019s its new country-specific growth forecasts: Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund believes that the global battle against inflation has largely been won. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, says the decline in inflation without a global recession is \u201ca major achievement\u201d. Speaking as he presents the Fund\u2019s World Economic Outlook, Gourinchas says: After peaking at 9.4 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2022, we now project headline inflation will fall to 3.5 percent by the end of next year, slightly below the average during the two decades before the pandemic. In most countries, inflation is now hovering close to central bank targets, paving the way for monetary easing across major central banks. But\u2026Gourinchas also fears that downside risks are increasing and now dominate the economic outlook: An escalation in regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, could pose serious risks for commodity markets. Shifts toward undesirable trade and industrial policies can significantly lower output relative to our baseline forecast. Monetary policy could remain too tight for too long, and global financial conditions could tighten abruptly. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has lifted its forecast for UK economic growth this year, as it unveils its new World Economic Outlook. The IMF now predicts that UK GDP will rise by 1.1% this year, up from the 0.7% it forecast back in July. That would make Britain the joint third fastest-growing economy in the G7 this year, in line with France and behind the US which expected to grow by 2.8% and Canada, which is forecast to grow by 1.3%. Italy lags behind with 0.7% growth, Japan with 0.3% and zero growth in Germany in 2024. The Fund still expects the UK to growth by 1.5% next year, \u201cas falling inflation and interest rates stimulate domestic demand\u201d. This upgraded outlook is a boost for Rachel Reeves, ahead of the budget next week. The chancellor has welcomed it, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s welcome that the IMF have upgraded our growth forecast for this year, but I know there is more work to do. \u201cThat is why the Budget next week will be about fixing the foundations to deliver change, so we can protect working people, fix the NHS and rebuild Britain.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s trade and immigration policies could be \u2018stagflationary\u2019 for the US economy, suggests Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. On the other hand, a Democrat clean sweep could lead to another government stimulus package. Ashworth writes: With two weeks to go until election day, Donald Trump has opened a meaningful lead over Kamala Harris in betting markets, although the latest polling suggests the race remains too close to call. To recap, we suspect Trump\u2019s proposed curbs on immigration and new tariffs would be stagflationary. Given the risk of an adverse reaction in bond markets, we are not convinced that Trump would push hard for another large package of deficit-financed tax cuts. A Harris victory would have no impact on our economic forecasts, except in the unlikely event that the Democrats also win complete control of Congress, which would boost the odds of a modest fiscal stimulus. Hat-tip to Deutsche Bank, who have calculated the annualised stock market returns for each US President back to Teddy Roosevelt in 1901. They have calculated that 13 of the last 15 Presidents have presided over annualised returns of between 10% and 17%, and 7 of the last 9 have been in an even tighter 14-17% range. So, while Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are presenting US voters with a stark choice, that decision may not have quite as much impact on the markets than on, say, society. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Jim Reid argues that it\u2019s \u201cbetter to be lucky than good\u201d, meaning events are more likely than policy to dictate big-picture market performance under the next President: The big outliers were driven by events that were arguably mostly outside of the control of the sitting President, namely the Depression, the 1973 oil shock, and the double whammy of the post-2000 bubble unwind and the early GFC shock of the George W. Bush administration. Academics have argued that Hoover\u2019s policies exacerbated the Depression, but you only have to look at the returns under Coolidge (the highest of any president) over 1923-29 to see that he likely presided over a bubble that contributed to the subsequent 1929 crash, even if he had left office earlier that year. So Hoover had a challenging legacy to deal with. Mexico\u2019s peso has also been hit by the \u2018Trump trade\u2019. Yesterday, the peso fell to more than 20 to the US dollar, a six-week low, before recovering very slightly today to 19.9424 today. Strategists at Danish investment bank Saxo say: The Mexican person weakened to more than 20 pesos to the US dollar yesterday as the options market in peso suggest investors are very nervous about the impact on the peso if Trump should become president. A Trump win next month could be bad news for the euro, especially if Republicans pull off a clean sweep on Capitol Hill. Goldman Sachs analysts have predicted today that the the euro could fall as much as 10% in a scenario in which Donald Trump imposes widespread tariffs and cuts domestic taxes after winning November\u2019s election. The euro is currently trading at $1.0827, so a 10% drop implies it would fall below parity against the dollar, as it last did two years ago. European policymakers have been shaken by Trump\u2019s proposal of a 10% tariff on all imported goods, which would hurt Europe\u2019s exporters. Trump has also been promising tax cuts, which would be potentially inflationary \u2013 leading to higher interest rates. In a new research note, Goldman\u2019s Michael Cahill writes: Tariffs have a direct influence on exchange rates, so we expect that to be the focus for FX markets in different election scenarios. More specifically, we expect the strongest Dollar response to come from a Republican sweep, which would open the door to larger tariff increases in combination with domestic tax cuts. Cahill predicts a smaller dollar rally if the election results in a divided Republican government, adding: A Democratic sweep or divided Democratic government would likely result in some initial Dollar downside as markets reprice the prospect of more dramatic changes in tariffs. Next week\u2019s UK budget is also influencing the pound. If Rachel Reeves tightens public spending more than expected (despite protests from colleagues), then growth would be weaker\u2026 and the Bank of England more likely to lower interest rates. There are reports today that the chancellor is considering increasing taxes paid by online giants such as Amazon.com Inc. That would help fund new support for the high street. Bloomberg reports: Britain\u2019s finance minister is looking at ways to change the existing system of business rates \u2014 under which tax bills are based on the value of a firm\u2019s physical premises \u2014 so that e-commerce companies such as Amazon pay more, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity discussing plans that haven\u2019t been finalized. She\u2019s examining the move alongside a move to reduce bills on shops, leisure and hospitality, the people said. The markets are likely to become more volatile as the US election approaches, predicts Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, as the polls have been tightening. Haefele says: \u201cAs neither party holds a clear advantage in any of the key swing states that could decide the outcome, the race remains too close for pollsters to call, and we expect volatility to pick up in the coming weeks amid elevated uncertainty. But we also think the potential volatility is unlikely to derail positive equity fundamentals and remind investors not to make dramatic portfolio changes based on expected election outcomes.\u201d The pound has dropped to a two-month low against the US dollar this morning. Sterling traded as low as $1.2967 this morning, its lowest level since 19 August, as the so-called \u2018Trump Trade\u2019 ripples through markets. Neil Wilson, analyst at Finalto, says: Markets think that a Trump win is a) increasingly likely and b) going to be bad for bonds. Markets are also positioning for broad dollar strength - DXY\u2019s rip higher corresponds to the surge in Trump\u2019s odds. Moreover, a Trump win ought to mean tighter Fed policy, or at least that is the thinking. Expectations that UK interest rates will be cut several times in the months ahead have also weighed on the pound. A quarter-point rate cut in November is currently seen as a 98% chance. Jitters in the financial markets are pushing down prices of bonds and shares this morning, and nudging up the cost of government borrowing. In London, the FTSE 100 share index has droppped by 58 points, or 0.7%, to 8261 points, the lowest since last Wednesday. European markets are also in the red, with Spain\u2019s IBEX and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB both down around 1%. Wall Street is set for a lower open in three hours: Bond yields (the rate of return) are rising, as bond prices fall, adding to losses yesterday. This has pushed the yield on 10-year US Treasury bills up to 4.2%, the highest since late July. UK gilt yields have risen to a one-week high. With the US elections just two weeks away, the possibility of a Donald Trump win is moving markets, argues Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, who says: The \u201cTrump Trade\u201d is back in the driver\u2019s seat, steering everything from bonds to the currency market, with election risks now gripping investor sentiment like never before. The latest data from prediction platforms like Polymarket, Kalshi, and PredictIt now show Trump\u2019s odds of reclaiming the Oval Office shooting past 60%, with talk of a Red Sweep gaining traction. And this isn\u2019t just making headlines\u2014it\u2019s moving markets. The dollar is getting a nice tailwind, rising against everything in its path, while Treasury yields, well, they\u2019re doing their best to keep pace, pushing above 4.20% as the market tries to make sense of what a Trump 2.0 presidency could mean for policy shifts, fiscal spending, and inflation. A Trump victory is likely to lead to a larger budget deficit, corporate tax cuts, and a friendlier regulatory environment, Innes adds. That could lead to faster growth but also lead to higher inflation and interest rates \u2013 with Trump also bringing further trade protectionism. Kit Juckes, chief foreign exchange strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cites uncertainty over the US election, and concerns that interest rates may not be cut as quickly as expected, saying: There was trouble in bond-land yesterday. US supply, political uncertainty, fear of extended fiscal accommodation and concern that the rate -cutting cycle will be shallower than expected sent US yields back to levels last seen in July. Juckes adds that there is a clear contrast between a US economy fuelled by fiscal largesse (or fiscal irresponsibility?) and pressure for more austerity in Europe (including the UK). Britain\u2019s farmers are urging the government not to hit them with inheritance tax on their agricultural land. The National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) has written a letter to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling on him to deliver a renewed agriculture budget and confirm the continuation of Agricultural Property Relief (APR). They remind Keir Starmer that he told them in 2023 that rural communities were in his DNA, as he grew up in a rural community. The NFU are concerned by reports that Rachel Reeves could target Agriculture Property Relief (APR), which allows land or pasture that is used to grow crops or to rear animals to be free of inheritance tax, in the budget. NFU President Tom Bradshaw says that reports that the government is considering cutting the agriculture budget, and possibly reviewing APR are incredibly concerning. \u201cWe are asking for a renewed multi-year annual agriculture budget of \u00a35.6bn, not because it would be nice to have, but because it is an essential investment to deliver the government\u2019s environmental goals, increase growth and support the economic stability of farm businesses. The loss of APR could mean family farms, who are vital to producing food for the country, providing jobs and looking after our countryside, having to be sold to cover the costs. Changes would amount to a \u201cFamily Farm Tax\u201d. It would also have a devastating impact on tenant farmers and new entrants. Motoring and cycling retailer Halfords has warned that UK consumers are wary of making big ticket, discretionary purchases, after reporting no sales growth in the last six months. Halfords told the City that its like-for like sales dipped by 0.1% in the six months to 27th September, following \u201cthe UK\u2019s wettest spring since 1986\u201d. And looking ahead, Halfords cautions that the short-term outlook remains \u201cuncertain\u201d, despite pockets of improving consumer sentiment. Graham Stapleton, chief executive officer of Halfords, commented: \u201cWhile consumers remain cautious in their discretionary spending compounded by uncertainty around the contents of the upcoming Autumn Budget, we have continued to focus on controlling the controllables and I am pleased with our performance in the first half of FY25. There is a small glimmer of good news amid the gloom in this morning\u2019s public finances for the chancellor. The ONS has cut its estimate of public sector net borrowing in the first five months of the financial year by \u00a31.1 billion to \u00a363.0bn. That, though, didn\u2019t prevent borrowing running at \u00a36.7bn above the forecast from the fiscal watchdog (the Office for Budget Responsibility). Philip Shaw of Investec told clients: Although the latest set of data represents a relative positive surprise, it does not shift the dial on the wider fiscal picture. At the halfway point in the financial year, borrowing is tracking some \u00a31.1bn per month above the OBR\u2019s projections in March and although the deficit is on course to undershoot last year\u2019s \u00a3121.9bn, its forecast of \u00a387.2bn for this year looks unachievable. Moreover it will certainly not alter the stance of the forthcoming Budget on Wednesday next week when Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to unveil higher taxes. Our Budget and Spending Review preview will be published later this week. Over in Berlin, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has declared that Germany has been hit harder than other world economies by economic headwinds and high interest rates. Scholz is pledging to work with industry to revive growth, telling a conference of the BDA employers\u2019 association. \u201cInflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, strained supply chains - as an industrialised and export-oriented country, we have been hit harder than others.\u201d Scholz said his government\u2019s efforts to reduce bureaucracy, strengthen investment and create affordable, sustainable energy would lift growth, adding that Germany also needs more skilled workers. Inheritance Tax has brought \u00a34.3bn into the government\u2019s coffers since April, which is \u00a3400m more than in the same period in the previous financial year, new data from HMRC shows. Rachel Reeves may attempt to raise more from IHT, which raised almost \u00a37.5bn in the last financial year, in the budget. Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club, says: \u201cInheritance tax is an absolute cash cow for His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, which is why it remains in the spotlight ahead of next weeks\u2019 Autumn Budget. No one knows what changes will be announced, but most agree there will be some attempt to milk more revenue from estates. The great thing about inheritance tax from the government\u2019s point of view is that it\u2019s complicated, with a whole host of rules that could be tweaked to boost the tax take. Tweaks could include changes to Business Relief, including on AIM shares, making pensions subject to inheritance tax and extending the time period needed to make gifts inheritance tax free. Labour MP Torsten Bell says the rise in borrowing in September is due to the mismanagement of the economy by the previous government: Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures highlight the difficult position of our public finances after years of mismanagement under the previous Conservative government \u2013 but this can\u2019t be an excuse for the Chancellor to make the wrong decisions at the Budget. \u201cWe need to see urgent investment in our NHS and public services which have been reduced to their knees and bold action to fix our crumbling schools and hospitals. \u201cThe burden of fixing the Conservatives\u2019 mess mustn\u2019t fall on hard working households, but on the big banks, social media companies and oil and gas giants that can afford to pay a small amount of their soaring profits to get our public services back on their feet.\u201d Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics, says: While it is too late for September\u2019s disappointing public finances figures to influence the amount of headroom the OBR will hand the Chancellor in the Budget on 30th October, they do highlight the limited scope the Chancellor has to increase day-to-day spending without raising taxes. That said, if she tweaks her fiscal rules, she will still have room to raise public investment. A group of MPs are urging Rachel Reeves to impose a wealth tax on Britain\u2019s rich in next week\u2019s budget rather than announce spending cuts that would hit the most poor hardest. In a letter to the chancellor, the MPs \u2013 including the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his then shadow chancellor, John McDonnell \u2013 say she could raise \u00a324bn a year from a 2% tax on wealth above \u00a310m and lay the foundations for a fairer, more sustainable economy. The letter, organised by the campaign group Green New Deal Rising, says in contrast to the general trend, taxes on the very richest are only slightly more onerous than they were in the mid-1960s. \u201cThis is deeply unfair and immoral: in an age of climate and economic crises, where public funds are desperately needed, it is necessary that we redress this imbalance. The transformative potential of taxes on extreme wealth is clear, and appetite for them is growing.\u201d Cara Pacitti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, says: \u201cSix months into the financial year, Britain is borrowing \u00a36.7bn more than expected at the time of the Budget in March. This reflects central government spending which is \u00a311.5bn higher than anticipated, largely due to public sector pay rises and higher running costs. \u201cToday\u2019s data highlights the scale of the public finances challenges facing the Chancellor as she grapples with overspending today, the need to avoid austerity in the future, and having to fund extra public service spending through tax rises.\u201d The Resolution Foundation explain that this morning\u2019s data shows that central government spending is already \u00a311.5bn above the OBR\u2019s March forecast Most of that comes from spending on good and services, typical higher pay and running costs, which they say \u201ctallies with the \u00a322 billion \u2018black hole\u2019 identified by the Treasury back in July.\u201d UK borrowing would have been even higher last month, without Rachel Reeves\u2019s unpopular decision to means-test pensioners\u2019 winter fuel payments, and the end of the extra Pensioner Cost of Living Payment given in 2022 and 2023. Net social benefits paid by central government decreased by \u00a32.0bn in September to \u00a325.7bn. The ONS says: The usual increase caused by the annual uprating of inflation-linked benefits was more than offset by reduced spending on Winter Fuel Payments, partly because of the absence of one-off cost-of-living payments, which were included in September 2023 and partly because of the change in eligibility. Winter Fuel Payments are recorded (on an accruals basis) each September when the eligibility of claimants is determined, although the cash will not be paid until November. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, says the government was right to agree public sector pay deals last summer, even though they pushed up government spending (see earlier post): \u201cWe have inherited a \u00a322 billion black hole in the country\u2019s public finances, including no plan to fund pay deals for millions of public sector workers. Strikes cost at least \u00a33 billion last year, so it was the right thing to do to end those damaging disputes. Resolving this blackhole at the Budget next week will require difficult decisions to fix the foundations of our economy and begin delivering on the promise of change.\u201d ONS deputy director for public sector finances Jessica Barnaby says: \u201cBorrowing this month was about \u00a32bn up on last year, making this the third highest September figure on record. While tax revenue increased, this was outweighed by increased spending, partly due to higher debt interest and public sector pay rises.\u201d Here\u2019s a chart showing the key points from September\u2019s UK public finances \u2013 the final healthcheck on spending and borrowing before next week\u2019s budget: As a share of the economy, the UK\u2019s national debt is the highest since the early 1960s. The Office for National Statistics reports that public sector net debt excluding public sector banks was provisionally estimated at 98.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of last month. That\u2019s an increase of 4.0 percentage points more than at the end of September 2023. However, it\u2019s a little lower than in August, when the debt/GDP ratio was 98.8%. And that has beren revised down from an initial estimate of 100%. Overall (despite the cut to national insurance) central government tax receipts increased by \u00a33.9bn to \u00a360.5bn in September. That included a \u00a31.8bn increase in income tax, a \u00a3800m rise in corporation tax, and a \u00a3600m pick-up in VAT receipts. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s cuts to national insurance hit the government\u2019s tax take last month, today\u2019s public finances report shows. The ONS says that compulsory social contributions decreased by \u00a30.9bn to \u00a313.9bn in September, \u201clargely because of the reductions in the main rates of National Insurance in early 2024\u201d. So far this financial year (since April), compulsory social contributions are down by \u00a35.2bn to \u00a382.1bn. Hunt cut 2p off national insurance from January, and followed this up with a second 2p cut in April, which brought the main rate of national insurance contributions (Nics) paid by workers down to 8%. In April, The Treasury says that the average worker on \u00a335,400 will save more than \u00a3900 a year as a result of the cuts in January and April. Having promised not to raise taxes on \u2018working people\u2019, Reeves can\u2019t really reverse Hunt\u2019s cuts to. But, she has strongly hinted that she could raise employer national insurance contributions. Public sector pay rises also added to government spending \u2013 and thus borrowing \u2013 last month. Today\u2019s public finances report says: Central government departmental spending on goods and services increased by \u00a32.6bn to \u00a335.9bn, as pay rises and inflation increased running costs Shortly after taking office, the Labour government settled pay claims with junior doctors, and with train drivers, to end industrial action that had been hurting the economy. The cost of servicing the UK\u2019s national debt jumped last month. The interest payable on the UK\u2019s government debt rose to \u00a35.6bn last month, up from just \u00a3900m in September 2023. The ONS says: This was because the interest payable in September 2023 was exceptionally low at \u00a30.9 billion, rather than that of September 2024 being unusually high. The interest bill on index-linked debt rises and falls with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain\u2019s government borrowing rose faster than official forecasts expected in September, in a timely reminder of the challenges facing Rachel Reeves as she prepares to deliver the budget next week. The UK borrowed \u00a316.6bn last month to cover the difference between public sector spending and income. That\u2019s \u00a32.1bn more than in September 2023 and the third highest September borrowing since monthly records began in January 1993. Significantly, it\u2019s also \u00a31.5bn higher than the \u00a315.1bn borrowing forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for September, a sign that higher borrowing is adding to the chancellor\u2019s challenge of raising money for public services without breaking pledges not to raise certain taxes. However, it\u2019s a little lower than the \u00a317.5bn which City economists had forecast. So far this financial year, the UK has borrowed \u00a379.6bn, which is \u00a31.2bn more than at the same point in the last financial year That is \u00a36.7bn more than the \u00a373bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility for this period. We\u2019ll get the OBR\u2019s new forecasts in just over a week\u2019s time, after Reeves delivers the budget. The latest public finances show that central government\u2019s receipts were \u00a380.7bn in September, \u00a33.3bn more than in September 2023. But that was overtaken by higher spending; central government\u2019s total expenditure was \u00a393.7bn in September, \u00a35.5bn more than in September 2023. Reeves is heading to Washington DC later this week for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, where finance ministers, central bank governors, thinktank chiefs and charity bosses will discuss the state of the global economy and its ability to generate a higher standard of living. We\u2019ll hear from the IMF, and from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, later today.

      "body": "<p>In the fallout from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/21/martyn-blake-met-police-officer-who-shot-chris-kaba-acquitted\">the acquittal of Martyn Blake, the police firearms officer</a> who stood trial for the murder of Chris Kaba, many questions have arisen. One of them is why the he was not charged with manslaughter.</p> <p>The theory goes that it was always going to be difficult to get a jury to convict a police officer of the most serious form of homicide, whereas manslaughter may have been an easier to prove and more palatable option.</p> <p>The argument appears to be supported by the fact that no police officer has ever been convicted of murdering a suspect and that the only time an officer has been found guilty over a death in the line of duty in the last 37 years was for manslaughter.</p> <p>However, in that 2022 case, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/23/police-officer-guilty-of-manslaughter-of-ex-footballer-dalian-atkinson\">PC Benjamin Monk was convicted over the death of the former footballer Dalian Atkinson</a>, the officer did not kill the former professional footballer with a firearm but used an electric stun gun on him and kicked him in the head as he lay on the ground.</p> <p>Monk was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter, which is when death occurs as a result of a criminal act that a reasonable person would realise must have subjected the victim to at least some risk of harm. By contrast, a murder conviction requires intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. So, in the Monk case, the jury had to decide whether it was an unlawful act, and also the level of harm he intended to cause Atkinson or should have foreseen would have been inflicted on him.</p> <p>While Blake said he did not intend to kill Kaba and told the court he aimed for his central body mass \u2013 the bullet actually struck Kaba in the head \u2013 it would be difficult to argue that the intent, when shooting someone, was not to cause grievous bodily harm, a difficulty that would extend to other cases involving police firearms officers.</p> <p>The key issue in the Blake trial was therefore not the level of harm he intended to cause to Kaba but whether he acted lawfully, ie in self-defence, and to protect colleagues, as he had claimed in court.</p> <p>If the jury felt that he had acted unlawfully, it would only have had to find that by firing at Kaba\u2019s chest Blake intended to cause him grievous bodily harm to conclude that he was guilty of murder. As such, it seems unlikely that giving the jury the alternative option of unlawful act manslaughter would have made a difference.</p> <p>After Blake gave evidence in his defence, the prosecution did ask the trial judge to offer the jury an alternative charge of manslaughter but Mr Justice Goss refused. Similarly, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/03/police-marksman-anthony-long-cleared-azelle-rodney-murder\">the last murder trial of an armed officer</a>, Tony Long, over the 2005 shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/03/azelle-rodney-case-piecing-together-events-10-years-on\">Azelle Rodney</a>, the judge refused to allow the charge of manslaughter to be put before the jury alongside the more serious alleged offence.</p> <p>A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said: \u201cWe presented the case on the basis that this was murder and that there was no realistic alternative. This is because our case was that the defendant used fatal force and therefore intended to kill or at the very least to cause serious harm and that he was not acting in lawful self-defence.\u201d</p> <p>They said Blake\u2019s evidence that he did not intend to cause serious harm \u201craised the possibility that manslaughter could be left open to the jury\u201d but this argument was rejected by Goss.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the fallout from the acquittal of Martyn Blake, the police firearms officer who stood trial for the murder of Chris Kaba, many questions have arisen. One of them is why the he was not charged with manslaughter. The theory goes that it was always going to be difficult to get a jury to convict a police officer of the most serious form of homicide, whereas manslaughter may have been an easier to prove and more palatable option. The argument appears to be supported by the fact that no police officer has ever been convicted of murdering a suspect and that the only time an officer has been found guilty over a death in the line of duty in the last 37 years was for manslaughter. However, in that 2022 case, in which PC Benjamin Monk was convicted over the death of the former footballer Dalian Atkinson, the officer did not kill the former professional footballer with a firearm but used an electric stun gun on him and kicked him in the head as he lay on the ground. Monk was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter, which is when death occurs as a result of a criminal act that a reasonable person would realise must have subjected the victim to at least some risk of harm. By contrast, a murder conviction requires intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. So, in the Monk case, the jury had to decide whether it was an unlawful act, and also the level of harm he intended to cause Atkinson or should have foreseen would have been inflicted on him. While Blake said he did not intend to kill Kaba and told the court he aimed for his central body mass \u2013 the bullet actually struck Kaba in the head \u2013 it would be difficult to argue that the intent, when shooting someone, was not to cause grievous bodily harm, a difficulty that would extend to other cases involving police firearms officers. The key issue in the Blake trial was therefore not the level of harm he intended to cause to Kaba but whether he acted lawfully, ie in self-defence, and to protect colleagues, as he had claimed in court. If the jury felt that he had acted unlawfully, it would only have had to find that by firing at Kaba\u2019s chest Blake intended to cause him grievous bodily harm to conclude that he was guilty of murder. As such, it seems unlikely that giving the jury the alternative option of unlawful act manslaughter would have made a difference. After Blake gave evidence in his defence, the prosecution did ask the trial judge to offer the jury an alternative charge of manslaughter but Mr Justice Goss refused. Similarly, in the last murder trial of an armed officer, Tony Long, over the 2005 shooting of Azelle Rodney, the judge refused to allow the charge of manslaughter to be put before the jury alongside the more serious alleged offence. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said: \u201cWe presented the case on the basis that this was murder and that there was no realistic alternative. This is because our case was that the defendant used fatal force and therefore intended to kill or at the very least to cause serious harm and that he was not acting in lawful self-defence.\u201d They said Blake\u2019s evidence that he did not intend to cause serious harm \u201craised the possibility that manslaughter could be left open to the jury\u201d but this argument was rejected by Goss.",

Liverpool\u2019s head coach has no complaints over results, the Nottingham Forest defeat last month notwithstanding, but insists there is more to come from his team in terms of dominating with the ball and against high-calibre opposition. \u201cYou cannot ask for much more with results but there is always room for improvement,\u201d Slot said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we outplayed Chelsea. We certainly did not. I think they were more dominant than us with the ball. In an ideal world I would have seen us dominate the complete game. We are not there yet. The good thing is, if we face a team like Chelsea and United, you see a team fighting for every centimetre or every moment that can be decisive in the game. \u201cI am hoping in the future, hopefully the near future, we will play a game like Milan or [Manchester] United and become more dominant than we were against Chelsea. \u201cMaybe that says a lot more about Chelsea. A lot of people in England made fun of them in the summer about investing so much money. In my opinion, they have done so well to bring many talented players in. With such a strong squad and manager, they will be up there in the coming years. That\u2019s my opinion, let\u2019s see if I\u2019m right.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Red Bull\u2019s incoming head of global soccer, will not attend the game on Wednesday as he continues to enjoy a holiday. The Liverpool midfielder and former Leipzig player Dominik Szoboszlai said of Klopp: \u201cIt\u2019s different job to a coach but I am happy he is back. He is such a name in football that you don\u2019t want to forget about him and it is good he stays in football.\u201d Liverpool will also be without Conor Bradley, Federico Chiesa and the long-term injury absentees Alisson and Harvey Elliott against Leipzig, who have made a fine start in the Bundesliga but were beaten by Juventus and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in their opening Champions League fixtures.",

The issue </strong><strong>is our sex life. While I</strong><strong> am a very sexual being</strong><strong>, he </strong><strong>doesn\u2019t seem to be</strong><strong>. We </strong><strong>have sex about once a week, which might be enough for many people, but </strong><strong>not for me. I have tried talking to him about it, but he says there is nothing wrong</strong><strong>, which I </strong><strong>find hard to believe. I know</strong><strong> he regularly watches pornography, so I assume libido is not the issue</strong><strong>. I</strong><strong> am starting to believe that</strong><strong> although I\u2019m sure he loves me very much, he is just not very attracted to me sexually, and I don\u2019t know how to deal with </strong><strong>this. I</strong><strong> have never </strong><strong>had this experience in </strong><strong>previous relationships</strong><strong>, and it\u2019s triggering insecurities in me I didn\u2019t even know I had. I</strong><strong> have tried talking to him, suggesting we try to </strong><strong>spice</strong><strong> things up</strong><strong> \u2013 such as dressing up for him</strong><strong> \u2013 </strong><strong>but to no avail. </strong><strong>As much as I love him, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m prepared to live a life of infrequent, vanilla sex.</strong></p> <p>Family issues and stressful events \u2013 in fact, any type of stress \u2013 can negatively affect anyone\u2019s libido. It might be best to put your partner\u2019s current level of sexual interest into perspective \u2013 and to understand that it\u2019s not about you. Remember that people view erotic material for many different reasons, including when they are trying to elevate their sexual interest in general. Do not pressure him. Instead, try to find ways to de-stress both of you \u2013 ideally, planning relaxing leisure time doing things you both enjoy, or taking a vacation. One year of being together is not a long time. It will take considerably longer to truly get to know each other sexually, and it\u2019s never wise to put pressure on a partner or create sexual anxiety. Your sexual frequency will always wax and wane depending on what else is going on in your lives. Don\u2019t count your weekly lovemaking sessions or compare their frequency to what you think is normal or believe that others are experiencing. When it comes to eroticism, prioritise quality over quantity.</p> <ul> <li><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don\u2019t send attachments).

We\u2019ve been through a lot together already, including a serious family matter that impacted our lives a great deal. The issue is our sex life. While I am a very sexual being, he doesn\u2019t seem to be. We have sex about once a week, which might be enough for many people, but not for me. I have tried talking to him about it, but he says there is nothing wrong, which I find hard to believe. I know he regularly watches pornography, so I assume libido is not the issue. I am starting to believe that although I\u2019m sure he loves me very much, he is just not very attracted to me sexually, and I don\u2019t know how to deal with this. I have never had this experience in previous relationships, and it\u2019s triggering insecurities in me I didn\u2019t even know I had. I have tried talking to him, suggesting we try to spice things up \u2013 such as dressing up for him \u2013 but to no avail. As much as I love him, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m prepared to live a life of infrequent, vanilla sex. Family issues and stressful events \u2013 in fact, any type of stress \u2013 can negatively affect anyone\u2019s libido. It might be best to put your partner\u2019s current level of sexual interest into perspective \u2013 and to understand that it\u2019s not about you. Remember that people view erotic material for many different reasons, including when they are trying to elevate their sexual interest in general. Do not pressure him. Instead, try to find ways to de-stress both of you \u2013 ideally, planning relaxing leisure time doing things you both enjoy, or taking a vacation. One year of being together is not a long time. It will take considerably longer to truly get to know each other sexually, and it\u2019s never wise to put pressure on a partner or create sexual anxiety. Your sexual frequency will always wax and wane depending on what else is going on in your lives. Don\u2019t count your weekly lovemaking sessions or compare their frequency to what you think is normal or believe that others are experiencing. When it comes to eroticism, prioritise quality over quantity. Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.

But while you should reward yourself occasionally, saving can also make you think about your spending. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising how often we buy things \u2018in the moment\u2019 that we don\u2019t really need. If I\u2019m feeling drawn to purchase something, I try to ask myself whether I need it or simply want it. That can help me to put the brakes on my spending.\u201d</p> <p>Saving also builds resilience in several ways.

In the medium term, by saving, you may even be able to treat yourself more.</p> <p>The research also showed that longer life goals tend to be achieved by savers. More than three-quarters (82%) of those who regularly saved in five or six of the survey waves had become homeowners after 10 years, compared with just 15% of those who never regularly saved. Home-ownership, surely, is one of the best sunny days you can save for.</p> <p>Of course, even if you have great financial habits, dipping into your savings can still sometimes be tempting.

But instant gratification can be ruinously expensive, highly addictive and stop us from achieving our long-term financial goals.</p> <p>\u201cSmartphones and social media lead to endless scrolling with product placement and adverts delving into our subconscious, triggering the impulse to buy now,\u201d says Rachel Jones, senior marketing manager at Coventry Building Society. \u201cWe have become a nation fixed on the dopamine hit of online purchases.\u201d Delayed gratification \u2013 the idea of deferring something that we want \u2013 feels like part of an increasingly distant past.</p> <p>In fact, these concerns aren\u2019t entirely new. The first credit card was launched in 1958 and, as cards spread across the US then the world in the 1970s and 80s, concerns about instant gratification became widespread. A host of studies have explored the links between a person\u2019s ability to delay gratification and better long-term life outcomes \u2013 most famously the so-called marshmallow experiment, conducted in 1970 at Stanford University. In its most basic form, a child was left in a room with a marshmallow for 15 minutes. When the researcher returned, if the child hadn\u2019t eaten the marshmallow, they were given a second marshmallow.</p> <p>But despite knowing that delayed gratification is good for us, it is unrealistic to expect a return to the deferred rewards of earlier times. We live with a level of always-on consumerism and advertising saturation that would be pretty jaw-dropping to even the headiest 1980s consumers tanked up on cable TV and their first credit cards.</p> <p>Jones suggests we should try and strike a balance and navigate a third way between delayed and instant gratification. Perhaps you could call it \u201csemi-delayed gratification\u201d. This third path would recognise that we can\u2019t just concentrate on big, sensible goals. Doing so leaves you feeling demotivated and that you\u2019re missing out. \u201cWe work too hard to focus solely on the distant future, we need quicker fixes to focus on too, creating memories that will last as long as our long-term goals,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should create different pots [of savings] to support different needs, which give us a future focus, but not at the expense of enjoying the here and now.\u201d</p>    <p>A mindset of semi-delayed gratification would entail saving for the future, but also saving smaller amounts to keep yourself happy and motivated in the present. You build consumer resilience and good habits that enable you to resist clicking on every ad and endlessly ordering online, but you don\u2019t spend every weekend making plans for the future.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, because you consider each purchase carefully, the goods or services mean more when you get them. \u201cYou create a harmony between the short and long term,\u201d says Jones.</p> <p>There are other benefits too.

While people often use high-cost credit when borrowing for treats, short-term saving means the costs will be lower and you create a virtuous circle. Andrew Gall, head of savings and economics at the Building Societies Association, said at the report\u2019s launch: \u201cIt is encouraging to see clear evidence that not only those saving for short-term goals, such as a luxury item or a holiday, achieve success. Those who set much bigger, longer-term life goals, such as buying a home, also reached their target.\u201d</p> <p>An important part of semi-delayed gratification is thinking strategically about what makes you happy in the short term, because this enables you to stay on track. According to a <a href=\"https://www.coventrybuildingsociety.co.uk/content/dam/cbs/member/pdfs/brand/save-for-your-sunny-days.pdf?utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=always-on-2024&amp;utm_content=sunny-days-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent survey</a> (pdf) by Coventry Building Society, shared experiences such as concerts ranked highly: 64% of respondents said that a ticket for an experience would make them happy.

So one way of helping yourself embrace semi-delayed gratification is to think about how much you actually value these experiences.

That\u2019s unbelievable.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And in a separate interview, Trump said ominously: \u201cWe have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within. And the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than Russia, China, all these countries.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/18/kimmel-trump-late-night\">Kimmel on Trump: \u2018How much garbage are his followers supposed to swallow?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fun-loving and mischievous,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cThat sounded quite threatening. That\u2019s actually worthy of some real examination.\u201d Trump later clarified that he believed Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, was part of the \u201cenemy from within\u201d, and yet Republicans tried to spin the message as non-threatening. Stewart showed a <a href=\"https://x.com/atrupar/status/1846207294226198771\">clip</a> of the Florida congressman Mike Waltz insisting that the media was just \u201cconnecting some dots\u201d that weren\u2019t there.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what he said. Not dots. Words,\u201d Stewart replied. \u201cThis is what gets us to the ultimate problem,\u201d he added. \u201cIs any of the shit Trump says real? How are we supposed to understand what\u2019s bullshit and what isn\u2019t?\u201d Stewart asked.</p> <p>\u201cRemember that day he tried to overthrow the government?\u201d he continued, referring to 6 January 2021. \u201cAnd I know it didn\u2019t work, but \u2018attempted murder\u2019 isn\u2019t the same thing as \u2018never tried the murder\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cSo we are left with this surreal idea that somehow Trump\u2019s absurdity renders him benign,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe dismiss his threats because of how much fun he has expounding on the length, width and girth of Arnold Palmer\u2019s cock.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmi0W96qYWw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zmi0W96qYWw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>A year-plus into the presidential campaign, \u201cwe are nearing the end. Also close to election day,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert\">Stephen Colbert</a> quipped on Monday\u2019s Late Show. With 14 days left until election day, \u201cthat\u2019s enough time for three psychotic breakdowns and a public pants crapping,\u201d he added, \u201cbut his supporters will probably love him anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert dug right into Trump\u2019s musing about Palmer\u2019s genitalia at his rally, in which he claimed other golfers ogled at Palmer in the shower. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crazy to unpack here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what stands out to me is the idea that professional golfers take group showers. It\u2019s an individual sport, not a team! You really think that Arnold Palmer, at the height of his career, was soapin\u2019 it up at the Y?\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone was impressed by the story; Palmer\u2019s daughter, Peg Palmer Wears, told <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/arnold-palmers-daughter-calls-trumps-remarks-father-disrespectful/story?id=115008367\">ABC News</a> on Monday that she thought the comments were \u201ca poor choice of approaches to remembering my father\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo one wants to hear that about their dad!\u201d said Colbert.</p> <p>In a similar vein, Trump tried to engage with customers at a McDonald\u2019s, where he was \u201cworking\u201d as part of a photo op, by asking: \u201cHow did you produce those good looking kids?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you produce those kids? Is that an appropriate question?\u201d Colbert lauged. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to ask how kids are made, you don\u2019t go to a McDonald\u2019s. You go to In-N-Out.</p> <p>\u201cNo surprise, the man who\u2019s never had an actual job in his life did not actually work at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Colbert added. The half-hour photo-op was at a McDonald\u2019s that was closed to the public, as Trump served a handful of meals to pre-selected supporters. \u201cHe\u2019s not the common man!\u201d Colbert exclaimed. \u201cThis is all just blue-collar drag, but with more make-up.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJiFsUNXB04\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qJiFsUNXB04?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>And on Late Night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seth-meyers\">Seth Meyers</a> also reacted to Trump\u2019s comments on Arnold Palmer. \u201cRepublicans, is this what you mean when you say Donald Trump has a plan? Because the only plan I can make out here is a plan to bore the shit out of his audience,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, no wonder people leave his rallies early,\u201d he continued. \u201cAfter the first minute of that story, everyone in the crowd started looking at their phones googling \u2018can you get a refund for free rally tickets.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Trump digressed on Palmer for more than 12 minutes. \u201cYour story is bad, and long, and doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cSeriously, man, if you want a podcast, I\u2019m sure somebody will give you a podcast and you can tell these stories to whoever wants to hear them, but they can also fold their laundry while they\u2019re listening.</p> <p>\u201cSo with just two weeks before election day, voters have a choice,\u201d he added. \u201cOn the one hand, you have Kamala Harris\u2019s plan to stop price-gouging, lower prescription drug costs, mandate coverage of eldercare and give money to the parents of newborns and first-time homeowners. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump\u2019s plant to let everyone know that Arnold Palmer had a big old doggie dick.\u201d</p>",

What the fuck?!\u201d \u201cIt is so surreal,\u201d he added. \u201cThis campaign cannot get any weirder.\u201d And the \u201cabsurdity-outrage cycle reached its apex\u201d this weekend at a Trump campaign stop in Pennsylvania, where the former president went on a long-winded tangent about the golfer Arnold Palmer\u2019s penis size. \u201cArnold Palmer was all man,\u201d Trump remarked. \u201cWhen he took showers with other pros, they came out of there \u2013 they said, \u2018Oh my God. That\u2019s unbelievable.\u2019\u201d And in a separate interview, Trump said ominously: \u201cWe have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within. And the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than Russia, China, all these countries.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not fun-loving and mischievous,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cThat sounded quite threatening. That\u2019s actually worthy of some real examination.\u201d Trump later clarified that he believed Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, was part of the \u201cenemy from within\u201d, and yet Republicans tried to spin the message as non-threatening. Stewart showed a clip of the Florida congressman Mike Waltz insisting that the media was just \u201cconnecting some dots\u201d that weren\u2019t there. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what he said. Not dots. Words,\u201d Stewart replied. \u201cThis is what gets us to the ultimate problem,\u201d he added. \u201cIs any of the shit Trump says real? How are we supposed to understand what\u2019s bullshit and what isn\u2019t?\u201d Stewart asked. \u201cRemember that day he tried to overthrow the government?\u201d he continued, referring to 6 January 2021. \u201cAnd I know it didn\u2019t work, but \u2018attempted murder\u2019 isn\u2019t the same thing as \u2018never tried the murder\u2019. \u201cSo we are left with this surreal idea that somehow Trump\u2019s absurdity renders him benign,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe dismiss his threats because of how much fun he has expounding on the length, width and girth of Arnold Palmer\u2019s cock.\u201d Stephen Colbert A year-plus into the presidential campaign, \u201cwe are nearing the end. Also close to election day,\u201d Stephen Colbert quipped on Monday\u2019s Late Show. With 14 days left until election day, \u201cthat\u2019s enough time for three psychotic breakdowns and a public pants crapping,\u201d he added, \u201cbut his supporters will probably love him anyway.\u201d Colbert dug right into Trump\u2019s musing about Palmer\u2019s genitalia at his rally, in which he claimed other golfers ogled at Palmer in the shower. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crazy to unpack here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what stands out to me is the idea that professional golfers take group showers. It\u2019s an individual sport, not a team! You really think that Arnold Palmer, at the height of his career, was soapin\u2019 it up at the Y?\u201d Not everyone was impressed by the story; Palmer\u2019s daughter, Peg Palmer Wears, told ABC News on Monday that she thought the comments were \u201ca poor choice of approaches to remembering my father\u201d. \u201cNo one wants to hear that about their dad!\u201d said Colbert. In a similar vein, Trump tried to engage with customers at a McDonald\u2019s, where he was \u201cworking\u201d as part of a photo op, by asking: \u201cHow did you produce those good looking kids?\u201d \u201cHow did you produce those kids? Is that an appropriate question?\u201d Colbert lauged. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to ask how kids are made, you don\u2019t go to a McDonald\u2019s. You go to In-N-Out. \u201cNo surprise, the man who\u2019s never had an actual job in his life did not actually work at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Colbert added. The half-hour photo-op was at a McDonald\u2019s that was closed to the public, as Trump served a handful of meals to pre-selected supporters. \u201cHe\u2019s not the common man!\u201d Colbert exclaimed. \u201cThis is all just blue-collar drag, but with more make-up.\u201d Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also reacted to Trump\u2019s comments on Arnold Palmer. \u201cRepublicans, is this what you mean when you say Donald Trump has a plan? Because the only plan I can make out here is a plan to bore the shit out of his audience,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, no wonder people leave his rallies early,\u201d he continued. \u201cAfter the first minute of that story, everyone in the crowd started looking at their phones googling \u2018can you get a refund for free rally tickets.\u2019\u201d Trump digressed on Palmer for more than 12 minutes. \u201cYour story is bad, and long, and doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cSeriously, man, if you want a podcast, I\u2019m sure somebody will give you a podcast and you can tell these stories to whoever wants to hear them, but they can also fold their laundry while they\u2019re listening. \u201cSo with just two weeks before election day, voters have a choice,\u201d he added. \u201cOn the one hand, you have Kamala Harris\u2019s plan to stop price-gouging, lower prescription drug costs, mandate coverage of eldercare and give money to the parents of newborns and first-time homeowners. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump\u2019s plant to let everyone know that Arnold Palmer had a big old doggie dick.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The wider world woke up to Ma\u0142gorzata Mirga-Tas at the 2022 Venice Biennale, when the Polish artist became the first Romani to represent a country at the international art festival. Stitched from domestic textiles \u2013 old clothes, rugs, patterned bedsheets and curtains \u2013 Mirga-Tas\u2019s maximalist presentation transformed the Polish pavilion with pictorial panels that blended art history, mythology and astrology with images of her Roma community in Czarna G\u00f3ra. It was one of those rare instances when an un-hyped artist burst on to the scene with bold, fresh, transporting work. She is deservedly now much in demand.</p> <p>Blending art and activism, Mirga-Tas uses her growing visibility to honour Roma lives and in particular those of Roma women. The striking final gallery at Tate St Ives carries six portraits from the series Siukar Manusia (\u201cWonderful People\u201d) in which stitched and painted figures are set against sombre indigo backdrops. Many are survivors of the Holocaust during which an enormous proportion of Europe\u2019s Romani population was killed. The dapper violinist Augustyn Gabor is pictured with his young daughter on his lap and a cat curled beneath his seat. Krystyna Gil, who survived imprisonment in a concentration camp as a child and went on to found an association for Romani women, appears at an advanced age, her face lined with care, seated in a bright floral skirt beneath a frilly standard lamp.</p>    <p>Her subjects are weighty \u2013 many had lives of great suffering and hardship \u2013 but there is irresistible joy in Mirga-Tas\u2019s handling of materials. While the faces and hands are painted on to canvas, their clothes and furnishings are stitched from patterned fabric and decorative trimmings. Real buttons bristle from the front of Marian Gil\u2019s shirt; Krystyna Gil\u2019s lampshade is trimmed with a tasselled fringe. Most wonderful of all, the bunch of flowers held by Anna Gil appears to have been caught by a gust of wind, which carries fragments of petals across her body and that of her delightfully portly husband, Jan. These are not works of commemoration but of celebration.</p> <p>Mirga-Tas\u2019s playful use of textiles include stitched figures seated on real crumpled rugs, or carrying fringed shawls that trail off the edge of a picture. She creates extravagant necklaces from sparkly trimmings. A three-panel screen carries a portrait of her mother seated on a plastic chair surrounded by friendly chickens with her glittering purple slippers on the ground beside her. Walk around to the back of the screen and you get the reverse view, complete with zip.</p>    <p>The freestanding screens occupy the only colourful room in the show and feel richer for their deep ultramarine backdrop. This is a much less maximalist affair than the Venice display Re-Enchanting the World: most works are hung isolated against white walls. This places intent focus on each textile collage, allowing for a close reading rather than an overwhelming spectacle, but something is lost in terms of vibe. This is not simply an aesthetic matter, but a political one. Mirga-Tas often works with historic source imagery that perpetuates stereotypes about Romani people \u2013 paintings and prints that portray nameless exotic beauties, nomadic ne\u2019er do wells, tinkers or musicians. She makes these images her own through the use of vivid colour and pattern. A white wall is not a neutral surface.</p> <p>The grand back wall of the gallery replicates some of the subversive grandeur of the Venice presentation, with the June panel from Re-Enchanting the World flanked by two enormous new works, each re-imagining historical imagery romanticising Roma women. At the centre of June is a jaunty lobster, marking the astrological symbol for Cancer. Above it is a stereotypical scene of a historic Roma camp with food cooking over an open fire. Below it, a group of contemporary women hang out laundry. On the monumental panel to the left, Mirga-Tas has transformed the nameless girl carrying a child into a Roma Madonna.</p> <p>Naming is important. A number of her fabric collages reimagine images from Les Boh\u00e9miens (1621\u201331) \u2013 a portfolio of popular prints by Jacques Callot. None of the historic artwork Mirga-Tas works from are by Roma artists, and none presents named characters: all, to a greater or lesser degree, are fantastical, falling into storybook stereotypes.</p> <p>Part of Mirga-Tas\u2019s mission is to present an alternative history and iconography for Europe\u2019s Roma populations. Two portraits here, commissioned for a museum in Seville, show the celebrated flamenco performers Juana Vargas de las Heras and Herminia Borja mid performance and magisterial. Even in her more intimate pictures, each figure is rooted in real life, right down to the textiles sliced up to dress them, which are often donated by Mirga-Tas\u2019s community. Textiles here bind family to history, invite us to recognise our common life experiences, and connect across scraps of sprigged bedsheets, reclaimed buttons and the trim on a pair of slippers.</p> <p>\u2022 Ma\u0142gorzata Mirga-Tas is at <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-st-ives/magorzata-mirga-tas\">Tate St Ives, Cornwall until 5 January 2025</a>.</p>",

The impact of such as loss has gained added attention as it is a common symptom of Covid. Now Sobel and colleagues say they have shed light fresh light on the conundrum. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the team report how they studied 21 people with congenital anosmia \u2013 meaning they have been unable to smell from birth \u2013 and 31 people who reported an unimpaired sense of smell. Each participant spent 24 hours going about their normal life while wearing a device that fitted into their nostrils and measured their airflow. The data revealed that participants with a working sense of smell made more sniffs as they breathed in than those with anosmia, something the team suggest may be a response to smells in the environment. The idea was supported by a further experiment that revealed these extra sniffs did not occur among people with a working sense of smell when in an odour-free environment. The researchers found that when awake, participants with anosmia had more pauses while breathing and a lower peak flow while breathing out than those without the condition, as well as other differences in their patterns of respiration while asleep \u2013 a period, the team note, when surrounding odours remain largely constant. The researchers fed their data into a machine learning algorithm and found that it was able to predict whether or not a participant had anosmia with an overall accuracy of 83%. The study has limitations, including that it is small, did not specifically take into account mouth breathing, and cannot prove that differences in respiration patterns drive health problems in people with anosmia.

Across Romania, similar outcrops of ostentatious mansions have sprouted in the most unlikely places over the last two decades, competing for attention with ever more elaborate rooftops, taller turrets, bigger porches and shinier fixtures. They revel in exuberant mashups of architectural motifs, sampling from Ottoman, Byzantine and neoclassical traditions, with a hefty dollop of Las Vegas glitz. And it\u2019s fair to say that most people in Romania don\u2019t see them as a particularly welcome addition to the landscape.</p>    <p>\u201cWe are taught to hate anything that doesn\u2019t follow the rules,\u201d says Laurian Ghini\u021boiu, a Romanian photographer who has been documenting these palaces in far-flung corners of the country for five years. \u201cOur society is completely racist towards the Roma community, so these buildings are often dismissed as kitsch and bad taste. But nowhere else in recent years can you find a style of architecture so closely associated with an ethnic group, which embodies their desire to be visible and get back their self-esteem.\u201d<br><br>Ghini\u021boiu\u2019s arresting photographs are currently on show at <a href=\"https://betacity.eu/en/\">the Timi\u0219oara architecture biennale</a>, curated this year by <a href=\"https://oanas.net/\">Oana St\u0103nescu</a> around the theme of \u201ccovers\u201d, taking in a broad spectrum of architectural copying, sampling and remixing, and held in the city\u2019s atmospheric crumbling former garrison, set to become the Museum of the Revolution, which feels like a fitting place to display these acts of architectural rebellion. Hung in traditional picture frames gathered from flea markets, Ghini\u021boiu\u2019s images paint a loving portrait of a community that isn\u2019t ashamed to have fun with its decor.</p>    <p>There are frenzied geometric-tiled facades echoing the patterns of Romani fabrics, and dazzling chequerboard interiors recalling scenes from Beetlejuice. Pointed rooftops shimmer with metallic fish-scale shingles, crowned with symphonies of ornamental ironmongery. They look like stacks of tinfoil tiaras, reaching ever higher towards the skies. There\u2019s a mansion with a gigantic golden dome, loosely modelled on the US Capitol in Washington DC. \u201cThe owner told me it was inspired by the back of the $50 bill,\u201d says Ghini\u021boiu. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what the building was, but to him it represented power and wealth.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to see why some successful Roma families are so keen to show off their new-found riches. Originally hailing from northern India, this nomadic ethnic group arrived in Romania in the 14th century, and were immediately enslaved by the Orthodox church and the landed nobility in a system of brutal exploitation that continued for 500 years. When slavery was finally abolished in 1856, the 250,000 Roma slaves \u2013 around 7% of the Romanian population at the time \u2013 received no reparations, while <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/10/5/it-is-time-reparations-are-paid-for-roma-slavery\">their abusers were handsomely compensated</a>.</p> <p>The following century saw a similar number of Roma murdered by the Nazis, while the postwar communist government of Romania enforced their settlement in the 1960s and 70s, outlawed their traditional trades and dispersed families around the country. \u201cThey had left their homeland to find a better life,\u201d says Ghini\u021boiu, \u201conly to end up in Romania, where they faced the same persecution and the same inhuman treatment.\u201d</p> <p>After the fall in 1989 of communist dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu \u2013 who himself had a ravenous penchant for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/22/romania-palace-of-the-parliament-communism-30-years-after-fall-nicolae-ceausescu-christmas-day\">bling-laden palaces</a> \u2013 the Roma enjoyed newfound freedom. Some became wealthy overnight from the return of gold that had been confiscated by the communists. Others did well out of the scrap metal trade, or found work overseas, or prospered from the grey areas of the emerging market economy. The palaces stand as literal representations of various families\u2019 rise to wealth; teetering trophies of their triumph against the odds and a gaudy rebuke to a society that suppressed them for so long. Their tumultuous stories are sometimes referenced in the architecture itself.</p>    <p>On a prominent corner of the main street in Buzescu, two hours\u2019 drive southwest from Bucharest, stands a house that has the neoclassical look of a town hall. Sturdy white columns march along its two-storey frontage, beneath a pediment emblazoned with the name of its owner, Dan Finu\u021bu.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the most important building in our beautiful Buzescu,\u201d one local resident tells me, breaking off from a wedding parade which is cavorting down the street to the sound of a lively manele band. Finu\u021bu, it turns out, was a prominent and wealthy member of the Roma community who was jailed for fraud in the 1990s. As he was sentenced, he vowed to build a mansion modelled on the very courthouse where he was convicted. He was a man of his word: this stately doppelg\u00e4nger was completed in 2003. Finu\u021bu and his wife were killed in a car crash in 2012, and their bodies now rest in a mausoleum on the edge of town designed in the form of another smaller version of the courthouse \u2013 an architectural middle finger from beyond the grave.</p> <p>Back in H\u0103\u0219dat, I find a creamy mansion whose three-tiered, red-tiled roof is crowned with a metalwork sign that reads: \u201cVila British.\u201d It is the home of Puiu Englezu, who made his fortune in Croydon, according to his neighbour. He is locally renowned for his gold accessories, including a necktie made of gold links, and the gigantic twin palaces he built for his sons, Codru\u0163 and Rambo. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1grA8lBfeE\">Their interiors look like something from a Harrods fever dream</a>, swelling with swagged curtains, ceramic chandeliers and gilded thrones, flanked by gold statues of tigers. Luxury cars with British numberplates throng the forecourt in summertime.</p>    <p>\u201cThese homes are all about <em>pakiv</em>, the Romani idea of social capital,\u201d says Rudolf Gr\u00e4f, author of <a href=\"https://www.buechercafe.ro/artikel.html?nummer=37009\">a book about the palace phenomenon</a>. \u201cThey attract respect for a person who was able to deal so successfully with the outside world, which is a sign of achievement for this relatively closed community. A house like this is the ultimate proof of success.\u201d Exotic worldly symbols are used alongside logos of luxury brands to signify success overseas. In the town of Ha\u0163eg, near H\u0103\u0219dat, there is a two-metre model of the Eiffel Tower on one rooftop \u2013 to which the neighbours responded by erecting a model of the Statue of Liberty on theirs.</p> <p>These palaces are not homes as we conventionally know them but supersized objects that serve a ritualistic role. They represent the core institution of the clan, a place to host special events such as weddings, funerals and family parties. Their owners don\u2019t usually live in them and, despite their immense size, they rarely contain kitchens or bathrooms. Day-to-day domestic functions mostly take place in smaller buildings around the back. \u201cThe Roma observe a strict separation of <em>vujo</em> and <em>marime</em>,\u201d says Gr\u00e4f, meaning clean and dirty. \u201cThese are sacred spaces, like a church, so they shouldn\u2019t be contaminated by toilets or dirty water. We might be used to bathroom plumbing, but for them it\u2019s weird having [that] running through your walls.\u201d<br><br>Ghini\u021boiu\u2019s photographs show interiors as immaculate stage sets; empty backdrops awaiting the next celebration. One shows a bright white entrance hall flanked by a grand, double-curved staircase on either side. But there is no balustrade on these perilous steps, and they don\u2019t seem to lead anywhere beyond an unusable mezzanine decorated with vases and classical statues.</p>    <p>Another image shows the sanctified chamber of a dowry room, where the bride\u2019s haul of embroidered fabrics is kept safely in cupboards. \u201cThe family of the bride provides the dowry,\u201d says Ghini\u021boiu \u201cand the family of the groom builds the house.\u201d More than a home, these palaces serve as a means of alliance-building between families, and act as symbolic vessels for the storage of the dowry: high-rise treasure chests clad in mouldings and mirrored glass.<br><br>Buzescu\u2019s main street reads like a bar-chart of familial oneupmanship, lined on either side with ever more outrageous confections. There are rooftops crowned with spiked metal balls, as if plucked from the end of a medieval mace, others that conjure witches\u2019 cottages or castle turrets. And there are plenty more where the money appears to have abruptly run out, leaving empty shells of unplastered blockwork and raw concrete porticos; Ozymandian relics of architectural hubris that dared to dream too big.<br><br>\u201cMy feeling is we have reached the end of the boom period,\u201d says Gr\u00e4f, \u201cand that wealth will now be spent on other things. Some families told me they had spent a lot of money on building a house, but their kids didn\u2019t know how to do anything because they had spoiled them so much. In hindsight, they thought it might have been more important to send them to school.\u201d<br><br>Whatever their future, these fantastical palaces stand as bold, brash monuments to hastily accrued riches, symbols of a moment when a formerly nomadic group \u2013 with no history of erecting permanent buildings \u2013 decided to go all out and make their mark.<br><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://betacity.eu/en/\">Cover Me Softly</a>, the Timi\u0219oara architecture biennale, ends on 27 October.</p>",

All we heard was the sound of trees cracking and falling over.</p> <p>Living near the top of the mountain we have about three miles of road between our house and the highway. The mountains normally block any kind of storm activity so we thought we would just have strong winds and rain \u2013 we were not prepared.</p> <p>When we stepped out there were downed trees, fallen power lines and about half a mile down we saw multiple mudslides \u2013 the road covered in 15ft of mud. Further down, there was heavy flooding and a 30ft chasm with waterfalls running through what was the road.</p> <h2>\u2018Houses and businesses were washed away by the flooding\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Sunday 29 September</strong></p>    <p>People in the community started congregating at the fire station, which is becoming the main hub for everyone in Gerton.</p> <p>Every day since the storm our next door neighbor Erik, who is a firefighter, and his wife, Kate, have been going out to rescue people who are trapped on our mountain. Hickory Nut Gorge (comprising of Gerton, Bat Cave, Chimney Rock and Lake Lure) was hit incredibly hard. So many houses and businesses were washed away by the flooding, people were still trying to locate their cars, and many people were trapped in their homes.</p> <p>My husband, Jeff, has been helping with supply coordination, trying to source things like generators from the outside world on Facebook using what little signal he has, and<strong> </strong>I\u2019ve been volunteering as a trauma chaplain.</p> <h2>\u2018The inside of his house was destroyed by water\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Thursday 3 October</strong></p> <p>I spoke with Will, a guy in his mid-50s with a leg brace and cane to help him walk. He lives next door to our community center which is alongside a creek. Will lost his workshop as well as two of his cars when the creek flooded \u2013 they were upside down a half-mile from his home.</p> <p>Will\u2019s home, a stone house, was still standing but the inside was destroyed by water. He and his girlfriend, Tammy,<strong> </strong>were able to get out before the water got too high.

      "bodyText": "The small mountain community of Gerton, about 16 miles south-east of Asheville, North Carolina, was one of the areas badly hit by Hurricane Helene. Three weeks on from the storm, the Gerton resident Emma Churchman describes its devastating impact and how locals and volunteers have come together to help the community on its way to recovery. Gerton, with a population of about 250 people, has a fire station, a post office, a general store, community center and a church. \u2018All we heard was the sound of trees cracking\u2019 Friday 27 September Hurricane Helene hit us in the morning when my husband, Jeff, and I were in bed with our two dogs and for about four hours we couldn\u2019t see far beyond our windows. All we heard was the sound of trees cracking and falling over. Living near the top of the mountain we have about three miles of road between our house and the highway. The mountains normally block any kind of storm activity so we thought we would just have strong winds and rain \u2013 we were not prepared. When we stepped out there were downed trees, fallen power lines and about half a mile down we saw multiple mudslides \u2013 the road covered in 15ft of mud. Further down, there was heavy flooding and a 30ft chasm with waterfalls running through what was the road. \u2018Houses and businesses were washed away by the flooding\u2019 Sunday 29 September People in the community started congregating at the fire station, which is becoming the main hub for everyone in Gerton. Every day since the storm our next door neighbor Erik, who is a firefighter, and his wife, Kate, have been going out to rescue people who are trapped on our mountain. Hickory Nut Gorge (comprising of Gerton, Bat Cave, Chimney Rock and Lake Lure) was hit incredibly hard. So many houses and businesses were washed away by the flooding, people were still trying to locate their cars, and many people were trapped in their homes. My husband, Jeff, has been helping with supply coordination, trying to source things like generators from the outside world on Facebook using what little signal he has, and I\u2019ve been volunteering as a trauma chaplain. \u2018The inside of his house was destroyed by water\u2019 Thursday 3 October I spoke with Will, a guy in his mid-50s with a leg brace and cane to help him walk. He lives next door to our community center which is alongside a creek. Will lost his workshop as well as two of his cars when the creek flooded \u2013 they were upside down a half-mile from his home. Will\u2019s home, a stone house, was still standing but the inside was destroyed by water. He and his girlfriend, Tammy, were able to get out before the water got too high. They scrambled up to higher ground and watched as the water rose as high as the roof. Will was matter of fact about what happened. He said he was going to survive this because that\u2019s just what you do when these things happen. \u2018Social media influencers tried to make videos of the devastation\u2019 Friday 4 October Our fire station was full to the brim with supplies and volunteers \u2013 so different than just a week ago. We were using all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) to get around as the road between our house and the highway was still blocked. So many people were trying to come into Gerton that North Carolina state patrol blocked the road for us to keep out non-essential people. We\u2019ve had social media influencers try to make videos of the devastation in the name of raising money for us \u2013 they were asked to leave. What we\u2019re going through wasn\u2019t something to gawk at. \u2018He cleared trees on our road on his own\u2019 Saturday 5 October A man called \u201cAnimal\u201d showed up in a bright yellow giant ATV. Animal was a combat vet and stucco mason from Chattanooga, Tennessee, with a foot-long white braided goatee and a gigantic smile. He used his massive chainsaw to start clearing the trees on his own on our road and around our neighbor\u2019s house. Animal volunteers regularly in disaster zones, sleeping in a camper that he hand-built for his truck. He said he loved being able to get to know new people and support others in this way. \u2018The propane gas delivery driver found a way to get to our house!\u2019 Tuesday 8 October We were now in the recovery phase. Somehow by the grace of God our propane delivery service found a way to get to our house. We were down to 15% in our tank by the time the driver arrived. He said he had 14 more deliveries after ours, spanning more than 200 miles, since so many roads were blocked. He was working seven-, 12-hour days in a row to keep on top of post-hurricane demand.

He also said it was hard for him to not get home in time to tuck his three-year-old daughter into bed. Jeff and I also hiked down the mountain and discovered that our road, which connects to the highway and was a chasm a week ago, will be drivable later. \u2018Portable toilets and showers arrived two days ago\u2019 Thursday 10 October The fire station discovered their septic system was backed up (probably because so many people have been relying on their bathrooms). The good news is that portable toilets and showers arrived two days ago. These were so helpful to our community members without generators who come to the fire station. \u2018Insurance refused to pay for repairs\u2019 Friday 11 October I spoke to a lot of people today. One group included a crew of lineworkers from Kentucky who arrived to restore our power. They apologized for taking so long and I countered with my shock that they had made it to our road already.

He had locked down Crystal Palace\u2019s defence and mounted a canvas for Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise\u2019s artistry.

      "body": "<p>The sound of birdsong is so loud outside Yulia Mykytenko\u2019s current home, an abandoned house somewhere in the Donbas region of Ukraine, that I can hear it through my laptop. We\u2019re speaking on Zoom, Mykytenko visible briefly \u2013 young, wearing black, her dark bobbed hair with blue-dyed streaks in it \u2013 before she turns the camera off because her signal isn\u2019t great. She has some outside space and, she says with a laugh, a local sheep sometimes comes to visit her dog. Mykytenko, a lieutenant in the Ukrainian army, also feeds the street cats, pets abandoned by residents who fled, and has her own cat. In her new memoir, How Good It Is I Have No Fear of Dying (the name comes from the first line of a poem by the Ukrainian poet Vasyl Stus), she writes that each of the houses her 15-strong platoon live in has a cat, to catch the mice and rats that chew everything, including the cables to the generators and satellite communications. Their numbers boom in the area, she writes, as they \u201cfeed on the bodies of hapless soldiers\u201d.</p> <p>Mykytenko, 29, spent two years here between 2016 and 2018, when Russia invaded the region, then again after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/feb/21/two-years-of-war-in-ukraine-then-and-now\">the full-scale invasion in 2022</a>. One of the first female frontline commanders, she leads a reconnaissance and attack unit. Her pilots use drones to track the Russian army and to locate the dead bodies of fallen colleagues and support their retrieval. Just this morning, some of her men \u2013 she lives with five of her platoon \u2013 told her there had been some heavy shelling at 5am, but she slept through it. \u201cI got used to it,\u201d she says. This current house is \u201cquite comfortable\u201d \u2013 it has running water (at the previous one, they had to fetch water from a well), but it is cold and takes an hour to heat.</p> <p>She is \u201ctired, very tired\u201d, she says. A year ago, she felt more motivated: \u201cI was ready to be at war for at least maybe three years more, but now, sometimes I really want to go home [to Kyiv]. But I know that nobody will replace me, and I know that my experience can preserve my people, my fellows [her name for her comrades], which is why I\u2019m ready to work for them.\u201d Is it a struggle to keep her morale up? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s a struggle, but yes, it takes some resources.\u201d On bad days, Mykytenko will ask her sergeants to take over, and she\u2019ll spend the day watching Harry Potter movies.</p>    <p>The coming year, she thinks, \u201cwill be most critical. I think maybe we will see some results, and maybe peace agreements, because our side is completely exhausted, and the enemy is also completely exhausted.\u201d There have been concerns for what it could mean for Ukraine if Donald Trump wins the US election, including decreased military spending and pressure on the country to negotiate an unfavourable settlement with Russia. She doesn\u2019t spend much time thinking about global politics, she says, \u201cbut I believe in US democracy, and the only thing I can do is support the American people and their choice. I just hope that the western world may see that this is not only a war between Ukraine and Russia, it\u2019s a war of democratic values. For now, it\u2019s a critical moment for the democratic world, whether they push away dictators, or they continue with intolerance.\u201d</p> <p>Mykytenko is resigned to war fatigue from the west; that Ukraine only gets attention \u201cif something extremely bad happens, like the bombarding of a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv\u201d, as happened in July this year. \u201cI can understand. Our citizens are exhausted and try to live not seeing war. I can see that with donations, it\u2019s a very small amount now, compared [with what] it was one or two years ago.\u201d (Like other platoons, Mykytenko\u2019s raises money online to pay for expenses, such as new drones and fixing vehicles.) \u201cSo it\u2019s not so surprising that the west is also tired.\u201d In her book, written with the journalist Lara Marlowe, she states she doesn\u2019t expect to see peace in Ukraine in her lifetime. \u201cI think that my generation won\u2019t,\u201d she says now. She just hopes that future generations will.</p> <p>Mykytenko grew up on the outskirts of Kyiv. Shortly after her younger brother was born, their father left, though she still saw him. She and her brother were brought up by their mother, who went back to work to support them, getting a job in a call centre (later, she would go back to university and become a psychotherapist, working for the military). Until she was 17, she spoke Russian, and viewed the country \u201cas our friend\u201d; her father, especially, was very pro-Russia. Mykytenko hadn\u2019t been particularly interested in Ukraine\u2019s 1991 independence, a few years before she was born. At university, though \u2013 the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, which actively promotes Ukrainian identity \u2013 everything changed. \u201cThe history events that we learned at school had a Russian perspective. At university, everyone spoke Ukrainian.\u201d She started, she says, \u201cto think in Ukrainian. Language gives you the right perspective on your history, on your culture.\u201d She started removing whatever aspects of Russian language and culture she could from her life.</p>    <p>Mykytenko joined the 2013 protests at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in Kyiv, which ended with the Revolution of Dignity the following year and the ousting of Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. She says she felt as if she had been at the right time and place in history, and was \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d even though back then she was \u201ca good girl\u201d, she says with a laugh, and found it hard to disobey the law. It was frightening to see protesters armed only with cycling helmets and plywood shields shot by snipers, and experience smoke bombs and teargas \u2013 nothing, in retrospect, compared with what she would go through later. \u201cI saw bodies of protesters, the price we paid for that, but it definitely was worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Around the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/14/crimea-annexation-10-years-russia-ukraine\">Russia occupied Crimea</a>. Mykytenko wanted to join up, but stayed on to finish university. In 2015, she met her husband, Illia Serbin, a young soldier \u2013 he was on leave from his unit in Mariupol and was lodging with Mykytenko and her mother in their Kyiv apartment. They fell in love and married quickly. They joined a unit together the following year, the day before her 21st birthday. \u201cHe supported my decision, and with him, I wasn\u2019t so frightened,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Serbin was transferred to an infantry unit, but Mykytenko was only allowed to do admin work, which was frustrating. \u201cI wanted to join to a combat unit, but I was told that I\u2019m a woman with no experience, there is no way. My husband told me, just calm down, you are at war, and you have to do your job best in the place where you are.\u201d Was she scared when he was fighting? \u201cYes, I was really frightened for him, because I knew that he\u2019s a warrior and he won\u2019t just sit in one place. He wanted to be in action, to go somewhere, to a grey zone [between the Ukrainian and Russian lines], or go and steal weapons from the enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, Mykytenko managed to convince one of her superiors to let her be on the guard duty rota (a packet of peanuts may or may not have helped with his decision, she says with a laugh). It wasn\u2019t a huge leap \u2013 she was guarding the building where she had been working \u2013 but it felt big. \u201cIt was important to insist that I can be the same as a man. I can do the same job.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I understand when I have no resources that somebody might die because I could miss something</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mykytenko found out that, as a graduate, she was eligible for officer training. There weren\u2019t many female officers \u2013 those that there were had mostly been medics, psychologists and financial workers. Mykytenko was determined to be in combat. Once she was commissioned, she was put in charge of a reconnaissance platoon of 20 men; 16 of them resigned. \u201cIt was one of the hardest times in my service,\u201d she says. She told them it was their choice whether they stayed or not, but they weren\u2019t going to push her out. Did she feel strong, or was it an act? Mykytenko laughs. \u201cAt first, maybe acting,\u201d she says, but her confidence in herself and her decisions grew. \u201cI felt that I was working in the right way, so I felt strong.\u201d It took a few months to earn respect, she says, and she gradually built the unit back up. \u201cI was doing everything with them, I didn\u2019t refuse hard work. I also lived with them, so they felt that I shared this service with them.\u201d</p> <p>Of her early experiences of coming under fire, she says: \u201cTo be honest, I was mainly excited, and with a lot of adrenaline, I actually didn\u2019t think that I could die.\u201d She hadn\u2019t seen anyone killed then. \u201cThe war wasn\u2019t so intensive as it is now.\u201d The fighting worsened, though. As a drone commander, she would watch battles on her video screen in real time. It was the hardest to watch colleagues being killed. \u201cYou understand that you can do nothing,\u201d she says, then adds that at least they can see where that person fell, to later retrieve their body. \u201cI just don\u2019t let feelings come too close, that it was a human being, my friends \u2013 I just do my job, and after that, when the person is evacuated from the battlefield, I can give myself a few hours of mourning.\u201d</p> <p>In February 2018, Serbin was killed. There were moments in that intense early grief, she says, \u201cwhen I wanted to die\u201d. She describes walking out into the open during shelling, \u201choping that something \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cDuring the shelling that I would die.\u201d It only lasted a few moments, she says, \u201cthen I thought that it wasn\u2019t a very competent and reasonable decision\u201d. I hear her give a small laugh. She requested a transfer out of combat, and back to Kyiv. Some people might think of it as weakness, she says, but \u201cI completely understood that I couldn\u2019t take the right decisions\u201d and never wanted to put her unit at risk.</p>    <p>Back in Kyiv, Mykytenko joined the military training academy. It helped her recover, she says. \u201cI was working with teenagers, and I put all my energy and resources into preparing them. And some of them actually are now fighting not far from me, unfortunately \u2013 I was hoping that they wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d She was responsible for the first class of female cadets. To succeed in the Ukrainian army, she thinks, women \u201chave to be ready to work hard and also have a tough skin\u201d. She has heard stories of sexual harassment, but says she hasn\u2019t experienced it, beyond inappropriate \u201cjokes\u201d. She differentiates between \u201cwarriors\u201d and \u201csoldiers\u201d. \u201cI was surrounded by warriors \u2013 warriors respect you and accept you and support you, so I was pleased to be surrounded by such men.\u201d She has heard plenty of sexist attitudes from men in senior ranks, but says she has stopped responding. \u201cIn the first years, it did hurt, but for now, it doesn\u2019t bother me. It isn\u2019t worth my resources.\u201d</p> <p>Mykytenko is not yet 30 and has been through so much, not just losing her husband, colleagues and experiencing the horrors of war. In 2020, her father, Mykola, died by suicide in Maidan square, after posting on Facebook about Ukrainian independence. He had changed his pro-Russia stance and had been campaigning against what he saw as President Zelenskyy\u2019s capitulation and withdrawal of troops. How does she cope with it all? \u201cI\u2019m trying not to concentrate on it, just because it\u2019s not the right time,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes I think I need some psychological support.\u201d She supports herself with \u201cbooks, movies, to try to find a way to have a rest\u201d.</p> <p>She works much less now than when the invasion started. Back then, she felt like a sprinter \u201cwhen I should have been preparing for a marathon\u201d. Mykytenko is mindful of her health and energy, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not only my productivity that depends on my resources, but also the health and lives of my fellows. I understand when I have no resources that somebody might die because I could miss something.\u201d In her book, she writes about not fearing death. \u201cI just hope that it might be fast,\u201d she says. </p> <p>She seems to live in such a present and physical way \u2013 whether heating water with chopped wood just to go through her basic morning routine, or enduring shelling, or watching drone footage in real time. Does she think about the future? Or allow herself to think about peace and what she might do when she can leave the army? She is quiet for a moment. \u201cNot really,\u201d she says, but adds that she has started to renovate her flat in Kyiv. \u201cI don\u2019t know [if that\u2019s] thinking about the future, but at least it gives me some stability.\u201d I hope she gets there one day, with her dog, and her rescued cats, and peace and birdsong.</p> <ul> <li><p>How Good It Is I have No Fear of Dying by Lara Marlowe (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, \u00a320).

It was the hardest to watch colleagues being killed. \u201cYou understand that you can do nothing,\u201d she says, then adds that at least they can see where that person fell, to later retrieve their body. \u201cI just don\u2019t let feelings come too close, that it was a human being, my friends \u2013 I just do my job, and after that, when the person is evacuated from the battlefield, I can give myself a few hours of mourning.\u201d In February 2018, Serbin was killed. There were moments in that intense early grief, she says, \u201cwhen I wanted to die\u201d. She describes walking out into the open during shelling, \u201choping that something \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cDuring the shelling that I would die.\u201d It only lasted a few moments, she says, \u201cthen I thought that it wasn\u2019t a very competent and reasonable decision\u201d. I hear her give a small laugh. She requested a transfer out of combat, and back to Kyiv. Some people might think of it as weakness, she says, but \u201cI completely understood that I couldn\u2019t take the right decisions\u201d and never wanted to put her unit at risk. Back in Kyiv, Mykytenko joined the military training academy. It helped her recover, she says. \u201cI was working with teenagers, and I put all my energy and resources into preparing them. And some of them actually are now fighting not far from me, unfortunately \u2013 I was hoping that they wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d She was responsible for the first class of female cadets. To succeed in the Ukrainian army, she thinks, women \u201chave to be ready to work hard and also have a tough skin\u201d. She has heard stories of sexual harassment, but says she hasn\u2019t experienced it, beyond inappropriate \u201cjokes\u201d. She differentiates between \u201cwarriors\u201d and \u201csoldiers\u201d. \u201cI was surrounded by warriors \u2013 warriors respect you and accept you and support you, so I was pleased to be surrounded by such men.\u201d She has heard plenty of sexist attitudes from men in senior ranks, but says she has stopped responding. \u201cIn the first years, it did hurt, but for now, it doesn\u2019t bother me. It isn\u2019t worth my resources.\u201d Mykytenko is not yet 30 and has been through so much, not just losing her husband, colleagues and experiencing the horrors of war. In 2020, her father, Mykola, died by suicide in Maidan square, after posting on Facebook about Ukrainian independence. He had changed his pro-Russia stance and had been campaigning against what he saw as President Zelenskyy\u2019s capitulation and withdrawal of troops. How does she cope with it all? \u201cI\u2019m trying not to concentrate on it, just because it\u2019s not the right time,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes I think I need some psychological support.\u201d She supports herself with \u201cbooks, movies, to try to find a way to have a rest\u201d. She works much less now than when the invasion started. Back then, she felt like a sprinter \u201cwhen I should have been preparing for a marathon\u201d. Mykytenko is mindful of her health and energy, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not only my productivity that depends on my resources, but also the health and lives of my fellows. I understand when I have no resources that somebody might die because I could miss something.\u201d In her book, she writes about not fearing death. \u201cI just hope that it might be fast,\u201d she says. She seems to live in such a present and physical way \u2013 whether heating water with chopped wood just to go through her basic morning routine, or enduring shelling, or watching drone footage in real time. Does she think about the future? Or allow herself to think about peace and what she might do when she can leave the army? She is quiet for a moment. \u201cNot really,\u201d she says, but adds that she has started to renovate her flat in Kyiv. \u201cI don\u2019t know [if that\u2019s] thinking about the future, but at least it gives me some stability.\u201d I hope she gets there one day, with her dog, and her rescued cats, and peace and birdsong.

      "body": "<p>The night after their son Mats died aged just 25, Trude and Robert Steen sat on the sofa in their living room in Oslo with their daughter Mia. They couldn\u2019t sleep. \u201cEverything was a blur,\u201d remembers Trude of that day 10 years ago. \u201cThen Robert said, \u2018Maybe we should reach out to Mats\u2019 friends in World of Warcraft.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Mats was born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a progressive condition that causes the muscles to weaken gradually. He was diagnosed aged four and started using a wheelchair at 10. By the end of his life, Mats could only move his fingers, and required a tube to clear his throat every 15 minutes. As he became increasingly disabled, he spent more time gaming: 20,000 hours in his last decade (about the same as if it were a full-time job).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not a screen \u2013 it\u2019s a gateway to whatever your heart desires</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trude and Robert wondered how they could share the news of his death with his online acquaintances. They didn\u2019t have access to his WoW account, but Robert found the password to Mats\u2019 blog, and they wrote a post. It began: \u201cOur beloved son, brother and best friend left us this night ...\u201d But, they wondered, would anyone read it?</p> <p>Trude and Robert were stunned by the response. Emails started pouring in from around the world: \u201cMats\u2019 passing has hit me very hard.\u201d \u201cMats was AWESOME.\u201d \u201cYou should be proud of your son.\u201d \u201cMats was a real friend to me.\u201d The couple had been anguished that Mats\u2019 existence was lonely, that illness had isolated him, but here were messages, some pages long, from his close friends on WoW. To the uninitiated, WoW looks a bit like Lord of the Rings, set in a fantasy world called Azeroth populated by trolls, elves and medieval glamourpusses waging war with fancy swords.</p>    <p>Nearly a decade earlier, aged 17, Mats had created an alter ego in WoW. <a href=\"https://scarteleu.fandom.com/wiki/Ibelin\">Lord Ibelin Redmoore</a> was a private investigator with flowing golden hair, the physique of Thor, and a roguish charm. Mats had been playing as the character for years, but the emails were the first inkling his parents had of how deep his connections were in the gaming community. The story is now told in The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, an extraordinary documentary, four years in the making, about to open in cinemas and arriving on Netflix later this month.</p> <p>I meet Trude and Robert in a London hotel. Recently Robert has been travelling around Norwegian schools with the film. \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen it 150 times,\u201d he says with a smile. They are a warm couple, direct and open. The closeness of their family shines through all of The Remarkable Life of Ibelin.</p> <p>The Steens had been approached before to make a film about Mats. \u201cWe said no to all of them,\u201d says Robert. \u201cIt was too close, too personal, too emotional.\u201d But they felt a connection to Benjamin Rees, a film-maker who, at 35, is the same age as Mats would have been had he lived.</p> <p>The Steens like to film everything, and the documentary begins by telling the story of Mats\u2019 life through their home movies. At screenings, this part of the film usually ends with half the audience in tears. It features footage of Trude in hospital after giving birth, stroking Mats\u2019 cheek in wonder at this little miracle. We watch Mats taking his first steps at around one-year-old, proud as punch. There was no suggestion that anything was the matter at that point. It was clearer by the time he was three. \u201cMats was staggering and falling a lot,\u201d remembers Trude. The doctors initially dismissed the couple as anxious first-time parents, before Mats was finally diagnosed with Duchenne MD at four.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM_hkJ0Rl-c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lM_hkJ0Rl-c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of the most painful moments in the film is Trude opening up about the guilt she feels about Mats\u2019 illness, because she is the carrier of the Duchenne gene. \u201cI still feel that sometimes,\u201d she admits today. \u201cI know it\u2019s wrong. I spoke to Mats about it. He told me, \u2018Don\u2019t say that mum. It\u2019s not your fault.\u2019\u201d Her eyes fill with tears. She gave up her job as an adviser to the parliament in Oslo to look after Mats for a decade. \u201cThe bond was very strong. We were so close.\u201d</p> <p>In the documentary, we also hear from Mats \u2013 his words, from the blog, are spoken by an actor. He is funny and insightful \u2013 and passionate about gaming: \u201cIt\u2019s not a screen \u2013 it\u2019s a gateway to wherever your heart desires.\u201d</p> <p>Then the film makes a complete swerve, suddenly switching to animation, plunging the audience into WoW. It\u2019s a move that will baffle some, but feel like a stroke of genius to others. Rees commissioned animators to reconstruct Mats\u2019 virtual life, with every line written by Mats and his role-player friends as they collaborate on the universe inside the game \u2013 culled from 42,000 pages of dialogue. \u201cIt almost feels as if they\u2019re writing a book in real time,\u201d says Rees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In Norway, most media coverage of gaming is negative. But this film is a celebration of online communities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We see Ibelin\u2019s first kiss with Rumour, the alter ego of a Dutch gamer called Lisette Roovers. Mats wrote about the kiss on his blog: \u201cIt was just a virtual kiss, but boy I could almost feel it.\u201d The moment is especially poignant because Mats also wrote about how relationships felt out of his reach: \u201cLove was always a tricky subject for me. It feels like it\u2019s not meant for me.\u201d</p> <p>Mats made close friends online and touched their lives. But for years he hid his illness in WoW, a place where he wasn\u2019t defined by disability. \u201cGames are my sanctuary,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am safe here, valued.\u201d But in the summer of 2013 he started the blog, which he did eventually share with some of his gaming friends.</p>    <p>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin arrives at a time when parents are agonising over how much screen-time to give their kids. In Norway there is a saying: \u201cGood people climb trees.\u201d But because of his disability, Trude and Robert let Mats spend more time gaming than other children. He was on his Game Boy during breaks at school while other kids played football. Looking back, Robert wishes he\u2019d made more of an effort to understand how important it was to Mats. \u201cHe invited us very often to come and sit by him to experience how this gaming world was going on,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I thought it was boring.\u201d</p> <p>Rees was keen to make a balanced portrait of gaming. \u201cIn Norway,\u201d he says, \u201cI would say 95% of the media is negative.

It\u2019s an acupressure mat that I got 15 years ago, and I use for napping or if my mind is busy at night and I can\u2019t switch off. It has this strange effect of getting you out of your head and back into your body. It also has therapeutic benefits, so I use it for any aches and pains. I pop it on my mattress, carefully lie my bare skin on top and cover myself with my duvet. <strong>Nerina Ramlakhan, physiologist and sleep therapist</strong></p> <p><strong>Shakti premium acupressure mat, \u00a3</strong><strong>74<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.shaktimat.co.uk/products/shakti-premium-acupressure-mat\"><sub>shaktimat.co.uk</sub></a><br></p> <h2><strong>SleepSound silicone earplugs</strong></h2>    <p>I have just been raving to a mate about some earplugs I have started using when I am sleeping in noisy environments. They are fully bespoke, fit my ears perfectly and are a bit of a gamechanger as I have never got on well with off-the-shelf earplugs, even expensive ones, as they feel uncomfortable when I sleep on my side. <strong>James Wilson, AKA The Sleep Geek, sleeping behaviour expert</strong></p> <p><strong>ACS Custom SleepSound earplugs, \u00a384</strong><br><a href=\"https://acscustom.com/uk/products/other-products/sleep-sound\"><sub>acscustom.com</sub></a><br></p> <h2><strong>Sleep Time tea</strong></h2>    <p>I always make myself a Clipper Organic Sleep Time Tea before bed.

Things are better now, in part, due to the paraphernalia that makes sleep more comfortable. I like to hermetically seal myself in with Loop Quiet earplugs, which block out all manner of noises, and I have a rotating collection of eye masks from Elizabeth Scarlett and This Is Silk, which block out light.

I now get outside as soon as possible first thing, to get sunlight into my eyes, which is great for sleep and mood. I also have a Sad lamp that I put next to my desk in the morning. I try to keep a 10pm bedtime, lights off by 10.30pm and I sleep well most evenings with a steady 6.30ish wake up. <strong>Anna-Louise, Northamptonshire</strong></p> <p><strong>Portable daylight therapy lamp, \u00a354.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/beurer-portable-daylight-therapy-lamp-tl30-60049843\"><sub>hollandandbarrett.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a344.79<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beurer-TL30UK-Ultra-Portable-Lamp/dp/B01515Y3T2/\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Sleep headphones</strong></h2>    <p>I struggle to go to sleep without listening to anything, as I keep myself awake with my thoughts. But I used to drive my partner up the wall playing podcasts he didn\u2019t like. I now use a Musicozy, which is a wireless headband with headphones, so I can listen quietly without disturbing him.

A few years ago, I was having a tough time emotionally, which was exacerbated by poor sleep. My brother had bought a Simba mattress for my niece a few months earlier and raved about it. I bought one in the sale, and I can honestly say it has been a revelation. I sleep soundly and usually wake up fully refreshed, which sets me up for the day. It has some sort of thermoregulation system, and I rarely struggle during hot weather. It\u2019s cured me of my lifelong habit of falling asleep on the sofa! <strong>Nadia, Reading</strong></p> <p><strong>Simba cool foam mattress, from \u00a3209 for a single<br></strong><a href=\"https://simbasleep.com/products/simba-cool-foam-mattress\"><sub>simbasleep.com</sub></a></p> <p><br></p> <h2><strong>CBD sleep drops</strong></h2>    <p>I had a bout of insomnia after losing my mum a couple of years ago, and I tried various things to help. OTO CBD sleep drops are the only thing I\u2019ve stuck with. They are expensive, but I take a few drops under my tongue last thing at night and they seem to send me off to sleep more quickly. <strong>Polly, London</strong></p> <p><strong>OTO CBD sleep drops, \u00a369 for 15ml<br></strong><a href=\"https://otowellbeing.com/products/oto-cbd-sleep-drops\"><sub>otowellbeing.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Audio books</strong></h2>    <p>I love an easy-listening audiobook. It makes my mind swim away to another world, away from the stresses of real life \u2013 45-year-old mum of one working three jobs! My go-to on Audible is always Harry Potter read by Stephen Fry. <strong>Claire, Hemel Hempstead</strong></p> <p><strong>Harry Potter audio books, \u00a317.99</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/series/Harry-Potter-Audiobooks/B0182T3A0C\"><sub>audible.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Mind games</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve finally got control of my racing brain by telling myself, \u201c3am is not the time to solve that problem.\u201d I then think of a series of random words to stop the thoughts popping back into my conscious mind. I started doing it as a variation on counting sheep as it occupies my brain just enough to keep the catastrophising thoughts out but not enough to keep me awake. <strong>Andreina, Bournemouth</strong></p> <h2><strong>Magnesium</strong></h2>    <p>Magnesium tablets a couple of hours before bed, then magnesium cream on my feet and legs, followed by 20 minutes on an acupressure mat does the trick for me. I come straight off my mat then into bed for a deep, restful sleep. I always used to sleep well until perimenopause and now menopause, which left me unable to get anywhere near a full night\u2019s sleep. With this routine, I\u2019m getting up to eight hours sleep again. <strong>Barbara</strong><strong>, Birmingham</strong></p> <p><strong>Magnesium tablets, \u00a35.79 for 60</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/vitabiotics-ultra-magnesium-60-tablets-10218180\"><sub>boots.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a35.95</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.vitabiotics.com/products/ultra-magnesium-tablets\"><sub>vitabiotics.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>White noise app</strong></h2> <p>I absolutely need my white noise app to get to sleep. I had bought a device that you get for babies, but the phone app works just as well and it\u2019s one less thing to charge. <strong>Jennifer, Brussels</strong></p> <p><strong>White noise app, 99p</strong><br><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/white-noise/id289894882\"><sub>apple.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Re:sleep programme</strong></h2>    <p>I had a chronic sleep problem and did the Re:Sleep programme (it used to be called the Sleepyhead programme), and it was brilliant. It\u2019s CBT for sleep, where you follow rules such as getting up at the same time every day and leaving the bedroom when you can\u2019t sleep. After that you do a thing called sleep scheduling, which tackles broken sleep by getting you to go to bed later and getting up earlier than you would normally, with no napping allowed. It\u2019s hard going but it absolutely works, and I now get seven hours of unbroken sleep a night. <strong>Fiona, Brighton</strong></p> <p><strong>Re:sleep sleep training, \u00a3299 for a</strong> <strong>six-month plan</strong><br><a href=\"https://re-sleep.com/\"><sub>re-sleep.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Sleepeaze</strong></h2>    <p>I occasionally use Sleepeaze, an antihistamine. I take one 50mg tablet 20 minutes before bed and it just gives me a deeper sleep, meaning I\u2019m more refreshed the following morning. <strong>Natalie, Manchester</strong></p> <p><strong>Boots Sleepeaze 50 mg, \u00a35.79</strong> <strong>for 20 tablets<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/boots-sleapeaze-tablets-50-mg---20-tablets-10263964\"><sub>boots.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Blue light-blocking glasses</strong></h2>    <p>Although my general sleep hygiene is good, I\u2019ve found these to be an absolute gamechanger, especially in winter. If I was doing computer work a few hours before bedtime I would struggle to sleep, but when I use these from dusk in winter or from about 8.30pm in summer it really makes a difference. Plus, they make me look more intelligent. <strong>Niki, Leeds</strong></p> <p><strong>Cyxus blue light blocking glasses, \u00a319.99</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyxus-Computer-Blocking-Headache-Eyeglasses/dp/B01GO25H6Y/\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Avena Sativa</strong></h2>    <p>I take 30 drops of the homeopathic Avena Sativa tincture in warm water before bed. It\u2019s essentially just diluted oats and it\u2019s very calming and soothing. <strong>Annette, Kuala Lumpur</strong></p> <p><strong>Baldwins Avena Sativa tincture, from \u00a37.35</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.baldwins.co.uk/baldwins-avena-sativa-tincture\"><sub>baldwins.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Alphabetical lists</strong></h2> <p>I started using a technique recommended to me that apparently is used in the army. You think of a letter of the alphabet, and then think of random things beginning with that letter. You may want to think of as many as possible or prefer to move on to another letter. It\u2019s said to be similar to the way the brain works in REM sleep and works a treat. <strong>Karina, </strong><strong>Sheffield</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contents\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/05/17/small-blue-link-embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

There will also be faulty panels thrown away that contain critical minerals \u2013 such as copper and silver necessary for the renewable energy transition \u2013 that could be recovered through recycling. McGregor\u2019s startup, Second Life Solar, has been working with the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority and the CSIRO to demonstrate the potential for reuse applications, recently completing a 100kW project at a recycling facility in Wagga Wagga, NSW, made up entirely of secondhand panels sent there for recycling. Reuse is supported by a mobile rapid test rig, developed in collaboration with CSIRO, that tests a solar panel\u2019s electrical and mechanical condition in under 60 seconds \u2013 and at a cost of just a few dollars. McGregor says reusing solar power that would otherwise go to landfill presents an opportunity for local councils and recycling facilities \u201cabout to be inundated with waste solar panels\u201d to recover their costs. \u201cThe value of that solar panel might be about $1 in terms of recycling commodities, by the time you process them,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I take that exact same 300-watt solar panel and put it out in the sun for a year, it generates $117 with electricity based on average electricity prices.\u201d The critical material shortage When solar panels arrive at Pan Pacific\u2019s pilot facility \u2013 part of the Smart Energy Council\u2019s solar stewardship program and supported by funding from the Queensland government \u2013 they are initially sorted for reuse, before broken and end-of-life panels are recycled. Hill has found markets for all the recovered materials \u2013 the glass, silicon and plastic along with the higher value copper, silver and aluminium \u2013 but even taking that into account, recycling still costs Pan Pacific between $10 and $15 a panel. The Smart Energy Council is calling for a mandatory national stewardship scheme \u2013 to maximise reuse and recycling, and to prevent replaced and discarded panels going to landfill. \u201cWe possibly didn\u2019t anticipate the decommissioning to move this fast,\u201d Cowie says. \u201cWe think that it\u2019s time for action now. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about ensuring that they don\u2019t end up in landfill. We are going to be facing a critical material shortage in the next 10 to 15 years.\u201d McGregor says: \u201cIt\u2019s also a good opportunity for Australia \u2026 At the moment, nearly all of our solar panels are imported from China and at the same time we\u2019re throwing away perfectly good panels \u2026 These panels have value and can actually contribute to the net zero target.\u201d",

This kind of tracking and time pressure isn\u2019t unique to the supermarket chain, but workers who are responsible for keeping shelves stocked claim they are increasingly being pushed to comply with unrealistic and risky standards.</p> \n<p>Late last year, the company introduced a new framework to enforce an efficiency rate for picking of 100%. Workers who weren\u2019t meeting the standard would be put into a coaching program. Some were directed to \u201cstop all time wasting and non-productive behaviors\u201d, according to warning letters seen by Guardian Australia.

But Australian warehouse workers have long been subject to this style of control. Engineered standards were introduced by Australian supermarket chains in the late 1980s and 1990s and were the target of industrial action.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy of total efficiency,\u201d Christopher O\u2019Neill, a research fellow at Deakin University who studies workplace automation, said of engineered standards. \u201cThe argument was: this was a \u2018scientific\u2019 way of rationalising work and eliminating wasted time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/01/coles-and-woolworths-have-leapfrogged-their-peers-in-profitability-these-charts-prove-it\">Profit margins at Coles and Woolworths were in line with major overseas supermarkets in 2008.

      "bodyText": "Tim* has worked in a Woolworths warehouse for more than a decade. He\u2019s helped load trucks and done other jobs, but mostly he \u201cpicks\u201d. When he arrives at work, he puts on a headset that tells him where to go, what items he needs to take from the shelves and pack and how long it should take him to do it. All the while, the company measures his productivity and pushes him to go faster. For years, the company has tracked almost every minute of his day. Take a long bathroom break and a team leader might ask where he\u2019s been. His performance percentage out of 100 appears on the screen when he clocks off, based on an algorithmic management system that predicts how long it should take to do each task. With a market capitalisation of about $40bn, Woolworths is one of Australia\u2019s largest companies. This kind of tracking and time pressure isn\u2019t unique to the supermarket chain, but workers who are responsible for keeping shelves stocked claim they are increasingly being pushed to comply with unrealistic and risky standards. Late last year, the company introduced a new framework to enforce an efficiency rate for picking of 100%. Workers who weren\u2019t meeting the standard would be put into a coaching program. Some were directed to \u201cstop all time wasting and non-productive behaviors\u201d, according to warning letters seen by Guardian Australia. Failure to improve could lead to disciplinary action and even loss of employment. One worker described it as a \u201cbullying\u201d tactic. Tim, who is over 60, said he was pushed to improve his rating. He got it to more than 80%, then 90%, then 100%, he said, but in his effort to work harder, faster, he was injured. \u201cYou might get someone that\u2019s \u2026 20 years old and goes to the gym every day. And someone like me. I\u2019m getting the average between him and me,\u201d Tim said. \u201cObviously, I can\u2019t keep up with him.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going down the same path as Amazon,\u201d said another worker, Ross*. \u201cWe\u2019re not robots, we\u2019re humans.\u201d A spokesperson for Primary Connect, Woolworths\u2019 supply chain arm, said its coaching framework helped \u201cto ensure a fair approach to the standards is applied to any personal circumstances or abilities\u201d. \u201cAs the country\u2019s largest private sector employer, we are committed to ensuring that our workplaces are safe and productive for our teams and customers,\u201d she said. Efficiency v reality Work in a Woolworths warehouse can be relentlessly physical: stacking products and boxes that can weigh up to 18kg on to pallets, wrapping them and getting it all into trucks. Much of this is timed. The amount of time workers have to complete a task is meant to reflect how long it would take \u201ca person with reasonable skill, applying reasonable effort\u201d, a baseline of performance known as \u201cengineered standards\u201d, according to a memo issued by Primary Connect. But Guardian Australia spoke to a dozen current and former workers for Woolworths and Primary Connect, who claim the standards are unfair and putting their safety at risk. All requested anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. As more people shop online, there\u2019s been growing attention to the treatment and tracking of workers in warehouses run by e-commerce conglomerates like Amazon. In June, the state of California fined the company for failing to properly disclose its productivity targets to workers \u2013 a decision the company is reportedly appealing. But Australian warehouse workers have long been subject to this style of control. Engineered standards were introduced by Australian supermarket chains in the late 1980s and 1990s and were the target of industrial action. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy of total efficiency,\u201d Christopher O\u2019Neill, a research fellow at Deakin University who studies workplace automation, said of engineered standards. \u201cThe argument was: this was a \u2018scientific\u2019 way of rationalising work and eliminating wasted time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a pseudoscientific veneer over this kind of fantasy of being able to control every second of every day.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email This year, Woolworths workers told the United Workers Union (UWU) that safety \u201ccould be jeopardised if pressure is placed on workers to work faster\u201d. According to the union\u2019s submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s supermarkets inquiry, the standards don\u2019t adequately take into account \u201cgap times\u201d \u2013 moments when a task cannot be completed because there is congestion in an aisle, a product is missing, or a spillage. One worker described a recent job to Guardian Australia where she was told it should take 14 minutes to pick 96 items from multiple locations, which she said was \u201cnot achievable\u201d. Others say the times don\u2019t adequately take into account the need for longer bathroom breaks, variations in physical ability or worker fatigue throughout the day. The rates are meant to be reviewed every two years to reflect changes in the warehouses. While 100% has long been the target, workers said this wasn\u2019t strictly enforced until recently, so long as they were consistent and not taking long breaks. Older workplace documents state that \u201c100% is our goal, not our minimum expectation\u201d. The new \u201cCoaching and Productivity Framework\u201d included \u201cGlidepath\u201d, a new \u201ctimeline\u201d to push workers to improve and reach 100% performance, according to documents seen by Guardian Australia. If they didn\u2019t meet the required targets and there were no mitigating factors, the worker would be \u201ccounselled and may be disciplined\u201d. After strong worker pushback, the framework was \u201cpaused\u201d before it was rolled out to all sites \u2013 but workers are concerned it will be reintroduced. According to the Primary Connect spokesperson, the standards that outline how long it should take to complete a task are based on a person \u201cworking at a safe and conscientious pace that can be maintained for the duration of a shift\u201d, while the framework helps provide a \u201cconsistent approach\u201d for its teams. They said the company has listened to feedback from workers and the union on the framework, \u201cand will engage our teams in the distribution centres in due course\u201d. Susannah* was picked for the program and warned after being told her performance was less than that of others on her team. She said she was told she would have to be retrained, despite working at the site for years, and was expected to climb to about 90% in just a few weeks. She said it was \u201chumiliating\u201d to be followed around the warehouse by a \u201ccoach\u201d, just as it causes daily embarrassment to have your efficiency score shown on the screen for anyone to see when you clock off for the day. The framework documents say that the engineered standards have not changed, but according to the UWU\u2019s research and policy officer Lauren Kelly it represents \u201ca sharp break\u201d from how they were enforced as recently as last year. \u201cMy worry, and the worry of the members, is that the response will be that we just need better data on how long it takes to do these tasks,\u201d Kelly said.

Instead of seeking single-origin nuance and bean-to-bar depth of flavour, I remembered how I felt as a kid reading about Charlie Bucket eating a chocolate bar once a year on his birthday, and how uncomplicated and overwhelmingly delicious it must have been. This was the closest to that feeling. The reviewers who agreed said it was well balanced and comforting. Others described it as malty, creamy and dense. \u201cHOW MILK CHOC SHOULD TASTE,\u201d wrote one taster \u2013 which says a lot about all the other chocolates we tasted.</p> <h2>The rest</h2>    <p><strong>Koko Black Moreish Milk, 90g, $12.99 ($14.43 per 100g), available at select supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 7.5/10</strong></p> <p>I would bet on Choceur to be liked by the most people but I\u2019d pick Koko Black if I needed to impress a snob. As a part-time snob, I can tell you we like to think we\u2019re experiencing something special or different. While this doesn\u2019t taste particularly special, it does taste different: it\u2019s light on cocoa and instead relies on a generous amount of \u201cnatural vanilla\u201d. One reviewer wrote it was like \u201cchoc-chip ice-cream, light on the tongue but powerful flavour\u201d; another said it was milky but with \u201can interesting range like dark choc, has some raisin notes\u201d. Where it really shines is the texture: it has the snap of fridge choc but without any compromise on meltiness.</p>    <p><strong>Ritter Sport Alpine Milk Chocolate, 100g, $4.69, available at select supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 7.5/10</strong></p> <p>This is in the Choceur school of crowd pleasers, but if Choceur is a friend who laughs at your jokes and smiles as you talk but never says much, then Ritter is the same friend 10 years down the track \u2013 they have a little more confidence and character. That character comes in the form of hazelnut paste, a delicious addition that almost made me rule out the chocolate \u2013 this is a plain milk chocolate taste test after all \u2013 until I noticed almost every other chocolate had other flavours added too. I\u2019d take a hint of hazelnut over imitation caramel any day of the week.</p>    <p><strong>Whittaker\u2019s 33% Cocoa Creamy Milk, 250g, $8 ($3.20 per 100g), available at major supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 7/10</strong></p> <p>When you\u2019ve consumed more than a dozen samples of chocolate, the smallest difference in flavour can feel like a chasm. When the tasters tried this, they wowed, yelled and looked at each other as if they\u2019d just come across a million dollars covered in boogers. They chewed in silence for a moment, until one reviewer said: \u201cIt tastes like the burnt underside of a choc-chip cookie.\u201d It was a divisive flavour: some disparaged the caramel flavour and bitter aftertaste and thought it was all a bit much. \u201cTrying to be pretentious/is pretentious,\u201d one wrote. But the majority loved it. As one reviewer wrote: \u201cCake for adults.\u201d</p>    <p><strong>Tony\u2019s Chocolonely Milk Chocolate, 180g, </strong><strong>$8.30 ($4.61 per 100g), available at major supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 7/10</strong></p> <p>This was the only chocolate of the day not to contain any extra flavours \u2013 it\u2019s just sugar, milk powder, cocoa (solids and butter) and lecithin (a common chocolate additive used to bind ingredients). But what does that combination taste like? Not far from what you\u2019d think \u2013 malty, milky, Milo-y and cocoa-y. If we scored only on taste this would have placed higher, but it was let down by the texture. \u201cGrippy and not that silky,\u201d described one reviewer; \u201clike biting into a candle,\u201d wrote another.</p>    <p><strong>Dairy Fine Milk Chocolate, 180g, $2.59 ($1.44 per 100g), available at Aldi</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 6.5/10</strong></p> <p>One taster described this as \u201cextremely hefty\u201d, and they weren\u2019t just talking about the weight. This chocolate is so pumped with sugar (of all the tested products, it has the highest sugar content per 100g), milk solids (unusually, there\u2019s almost as much milk solids as cocoa solids) and \u201cnatural flavour\u201d \u2013 which tastes like caramel \u2013 that it tastes more like a Fantale. Like one reviewer wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s not a whole block in front of (insert trash TV) kind of chocolate\u201d \u2013 but that\u2019s exactly what you want milk chocolate to be. The only times I\u2019ve eaten just a single square of chocolate were when it was rationed due to short supply. But after one piece of this, I was done.</p>    <p><strong>Moser Roth Finest Milk, 125g, $3.69 ($2.95 per 100g), available at Aldi</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 6/10</strong></p> <p>I think of most Aldi brands as imitators of famous brands, but like Choceur and Dairy Fine, this has its own character that is difficult to describe and appreciate, like the art produced in high schools \u2013 it\u2019s trying to be different and interesting but is executed with poor artistic vision. Some described it as hazelnutty or like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoa\">khoya</a> and other kinds of cooked milk. Others said it was like \u201castronaut choc\u201d or \u201csoy milk from 2002\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t say it was divisive \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a great range in scores \u2013 just confusingly average.</p>    <p><strong>Lindt Extra Creamy Milk, 100g, $6.50, available from major supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 6/10</strong></p> <p>When I was younger I would respond to any crush with overblown enthusiasm. When you lack confidence, you overcompensate. This chocolate is doing the same. \u201cEnliven your senses with the ultimate chocolate luxury,\u201d the packaging says. What is luxurious about it: the melty texture that tiptoes the line between creamy and oily, the jacked-up caramel flavour or the big whack of sweetness? One reviewer wrote: \u201cEverything I like in milk chocolate but just slightly too much volume on all counts.\u201d</p>    <p><strong>Godiva Milk Chocolate, 90g, </strong><strong>$9.50 ($10.56 per 100g), available at select supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 6/10</strong></p> <p>You probably don\u2019t expect a plain milk chocolate to be described as chewy, but here we are. I still don\u2019t know what to think of it (my scorecard has a \u201c?\u201d in the texture box) but others were damning. \u201cVery sticky and mouth coating. Almost rubbery,\u201d one wrote. The comments about the taste were all over the place \u2013 some said it was coconutty and others likened it to cereal. Confusingly, one reviewer gave it eight out of 10 and wrote that it was classic, with \u201cBelgian quality/vibes\u201d.</p>    <p><strong>Cadbury Dairy Milk Milk Chocolate, 180g, $6.00 ($3.33 per 100g), available at major supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 5/10</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m sure Cadbury used to be respectable, but sadly that era feels long gone. Eating this, all I can imagine are some poorly paid flavour engineers standing over a vat of melted chocolate who, having just been told by upper management they need to double the volume of production, start looking around for something, anything, they can add to the vat to bulk it out, but find only the family-size packet of banana lollies they ordered for the Christmas party. A \u201clolly hiding in a chocolate\u201d, reviewers wrote; \u201ctastes like yellow Clinkers\u201d. Cadbury\u2019s Velvet range fared slightly better (5.5 out of 10) but recommending that is like telling someone to search for luxury furniture on Temu.</p>    <p><strong>Sim\u00f3n Coll Xocolaters Xocolata Amb Llet, 85g, $7.99 ($9.40 per 100g), available at select supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 4/10</strong></p> <p>When the taste test was finished, the other reviewers took home most of the high-scoring brands, leaving me with a table of half-eaten packs of chocolate that I\u2019d just spent an hour criticising. My partner came home to that stack and instantly went for this brand. \u201cThose are the unwanted ones, you don\u2019t want to eat that,\u201d I told her, but she pointed at the packet and questioned how it could be so bad when it looked so beautiful. I don\u2019t know, Alice. I\u2019m unsure how a chocolate that costs double most of the others can have such minimal cocoa flavour and instead tastes like \u201cplasticine\u201d and \u201coil\u201d.</p>",

That\u2019s fine, I tell myself: I\u2019m a free-thinking, rational, analytical mind who can tune out any biases or marketing. Well, that\u2019s what I thought, until a taste test of 20 blocks of supermarket milk chocolate proved I\u2019m not only fickle but apparently heavily biased too. I was joined by 10 friends who, like me, scored the chocolates based on texture and taste. Because many supermarket chocolates have distinct shapes or names carved into them, the other reviewers closed their eyes when I gave out each sample \u2013 although I always knew the brand.

      "body": "<p>The fatal collision of two trains between Talerddig and Llanbrynmair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/21/two-trains-collide-in-wales-near-llanbrynmair-on-shrewsbury-service\">in rural Wales on Monday</a> evening is, in many respects, unique in Britain\u2019s recent rail experience. No head-on crash had been recorded this century, and there had only been one fatal passenger train crash since 2007 in the UK.</p> <p>Inspectors from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rail-accident-investigation-branch\">Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB)</a>, who arrived on the scene in Powys on Monday night and resumed in daylight, are likely to release an early report this week.</p> <p>While any conclusions drawn before the official investigation are speculative, reported witness testimony of a train unable to stop, the low speed and the time of year, all make leaf fall a likely line of inquiry, especially given the track was in a deeply wooded region of Powys.</p> <p>As Network Rail puts it, leaves on the line are the rail equivalent of black ice on roads. In autumn, specialist rail-head treatment trains run daily, or more when necessary, to blast leaves from the rails.</p> <p>The astonishing account from passengers of a driver running into the carriage warning them to brace for impact underlines the very low speed of the collision \u2013 seemingly less than 20mph \u2013 and the possibility that at least one train was out of control.</p> <p>The incident occurred about 900 metres (1,000 yards) beyond a passing loop where the Aberystwyth-bound train would have been expected to stop and wait for the other to pass, but somehow travelled right through to the point of impact.</p> <p>The last UK passenger train collision, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/01/salisbury-train-crash-detailed-and-forensic-investigation-begins\">in autumn 2021 in Salisbury</a>, was found by investigators to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/02/salisbury-train-crash-may-have-been-caused-by-leaves-on-line\">caused by leaves on the line</a>, when the driver\u2019s attempts at braking were insufficient to stop the train passing through a red light in strong wind and rain.</p> <p>There may also be another area of inquiry.

      "bodyText": "The fatal collision of two trains between Talerddig and Llanbrynmair in rural Wales on Monday evening is, in many respects, unique in Britain\u2019s recent rail experience. No head-on crash had been recorded this century, and there had only been one fatal passenger train crash since 2007 in the UK. Inspectors from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), who arrived on the scene in Powys on Monday night and resumed in daylight, are likely to release an early report this week. While any conclusions drawn before the official investigation are speculative, reported witness testimony of a train unable to stop, the low speed and the time of year, all make leaf fall a likely line of inquiry, especially given the track was in a deeply wooded region of Powys. As Network Rail puts it, leaves on the line are the rail equivalent of black ice on roads. In autumn, specialist rail-head treatment trains run daily, or more when necessary, to blast leaves from the rails. The astonishing account from passengers of a driver running into the carriage warning them to brace for impact underlines the very low speed of the collision \u2013 seemingly less than 20mph \u2013 and the possibility that at least one train was out of control. The incident occurred about 900 metres (1,000 yards) beyond a passing loop where the Aberystwyth-bound train would have been expected to stop and wait for the other to pass, but somehow travelled right through to the point of impact. The last UK passenger train collision, in autumn 2021 in Salisbury, was found by investigators to have been caused by leaves on the line, when the driver\u2019s attempts at braking were insufficient to stop the train passing through a red light in strong wind and rain. There may also be another area of inquiry. The Cambrian line where the two small Transport for Wales sprinter trains collided, despite being mostly single-tracked and running through some of the least-populated parts of Britain, benefits from some of the most hi-tech signalling. It was used as the pilot for the introduction of digital signalling and train control systems known as European rail traffic management system (ERTMS) and European train control system (ETCS), which are now being installed on part of the east coast mainline between London and Edinburgh a decade after being operational in mid-Wales. That means a crash is unlikely to be due to human error by signallers or drivers; a train should automatically brake should another train be ahead, even if the driver fails to do so. But the system itself has been the subject of previous RAIB reports: in October 2017, the loss of safety-critical data on the Cambrian line was investigated after temporary speed restrictions due to weather conditions were not relayed properly, meaning trains exceeded the safe speed limits. Whatever the cause is found to be, the collision represents another tragic blemish on the UK railway\u2019s comparatively strong safety record. The story of most of the last two decades, after a sequence of appalling crashes in the early days of privatisation under Railtrack from 1999-2002, has been a huge focus on safety and, for many years, zero passenger deaths. Rail remains by far the safest form of travel. Even as investigations resumed on the Welsh railway on Tuesday morning, the M6 motorway was closed again for another car crash. However, the latest incident comes only three years after the Salisbury collision, and if leaf fall proves to be the culprit, will put Network Rail\u2019s rigorous autumnal cleaning processes in the spotlight again. It also follows the Stonehaven crash in 2020, where heavy rainfall and a substandard drainage system ended up derailing a ScotRail train and killing three people, including the driver and a guard. That prompted warnings that Britain\u2019s railway would need more investment to protect from ever more extreme weather and a changing climate. Rail professionals will say they never took the proud safety record for granted, when more than a decade passed without a crash. Three collisions in four years starts to look like a more uneasy sequence. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 October 2024 to clarify that the European train control system is being installed on part of the east coast mainline between London and Edinburgh, not on all of the route.",

      "body": "<p>For a guy who has spent his entire life making \u201cI am very rich\u201d the keystone of his personal brand, there is something quite poignant about watching Donald Trump get financially cucked by Elon Musk on stage every night. Musk is much younger, much richer, and has had a much more successful series of hair transplants. But needs must, it seems.</p> <p>As you might be aware, Musk has recently decided to update the tired dystopian fiction trope in which impoverished citizens are forced to compete in deadly gameshows where the winner gets a life-changingly glittering prize, and the losers are killed for sport. In Elon\u2019s rebooted version, the richest man in the world is giving struggling voters the chance to win a million dollars if they sign a \u201cpetition\u201d in favour of free speech and the right to bear arms.</p> <p>You get $47 (\u00a336) just for signing up \u2013 $100 in Pennsylvania, for <em>some</em> reason! \u2013 and only registered voters can apply. As long as they leave their names \u2013 and addresses, for <em>some</em> reason! \u2013 they\u2019re all good to enter the lottery pit. Also, it\u2019s not fictional but real, and it\u2019s happening in swing states every single day from now until the election in two weeks\u2019 time. On Saturday, Musk presented his first state-of-the-art cardboard cheque for $1m to a man at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. On Sunday, it was the turn of a woman at a town hall in Pittsburgh. On Monday, his Pac (political action committee) launched a drive against election interference, because hey \u2013 above all, he\u2019s an ironist.</p> <p>Like so many of the previous new lows of this campaign, once this tactic manifests itself you immediately find yourself thinking: <em>of course</em>. Of course, of course. Of course Musk, 53, would become a dark mirror version of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgn8d04kdko\">MrBeast</a>, and use the YouTube giveaway playbook to go viral in the election endgame. It\u2019s at once completely shocking, and also an October not-even-a-surprise. Perhaps the only mirthless smile it can raise is when you consider the utter yesteryearing it represents for Hollywood.</p> <p>It felt quaint even at the time, but do recall George Clooney spouting off last year about how indispensable Hollywood could be to political campaigns. \u201cI always just say,\u201d George just said, \u201clook, everybody keeps coming into Hollywood for cash, and they don\u2019t come to us for the one thing we do better than anybody, which is tell stories.\u201d Mm. And yet here we are, with the dark stars of the election bypassing the gold-standard magic of a movie industry everyone can see is in crisis, and taking their inspo from YouTube, which isn\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/22/elon-musk-is-trying-to-buy-the-us-election-for-donald-trump-what-does-he-want-in-return\">Elon Musk is trying to buy the US election for Donald Trump. What does he want in return? | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyway, in scenes also some-way-past familiar: the old good-chap structures of political life are revealed as simply unable to cope with bad chaps who decline to play by the unwritten rules. In fact, even the written rules seem to be in doubt. Is Musk\u2019s stunt legal? Those scrambling to respond to this question are once again falling back on the old \u201cuncharted territory\u201d descriptor. Alas, if you were hoping we could get a couple of cartographers out of bed for this one \u2013 like, yesterday? \u2013 then prepare for disappointment. What we have instead are leisurely headlines such as \u201c<a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/20/elon-musk-donald-trump-rally-legal-scrutiny/75766213007/\">Elon Musk\u2019s pledge for daily $1 million giveaways draw legal questions</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, opined on Monday of the giveaways that \u201cI think it\u2019s something that law enforcement could take a look at\u201d. \u201cCould take a look at\u201d, questions being \u201cdrawn\u201d \u2013 I can\u2019t help feeling the vocabulary choices here indicate the sort of mid-tier to-do list priority that no doubt the relevant cops/jurisprudence professors will get around to solving in a few weeks\u2019 time. No particular reason you\u2019d want to rush this one. Is there?</p> <p>In the meantime, seemingly nightly, we have the world\u2019s richest man on stage in service of Donald Trump. Or will it turn out to be the other way round? Only time will show, but given Musk is being touted for some kind of anti-regulation role at the same time as his businesses are involved in <a href=\"https://www.legaldive.com/news/elon-musk-takes-campaign-against-the-regulatory-state-from-labor-to-aviatio/728337/\">multiple anti-regulation lawsuits</a> \u2026 let\u2019s just say this could go either way. In some ways, both parties could use a hand.</p> <p>And yet, neither is an underdog. However many years we are through the looking-glass now, I still boggle at the utter WTF-ery of Trump and Musk being able to present themselves as rank outsiders oppressed by the elites. \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019re having is, how do we get the public to know about this petition because the legacy media won\u2019t report on it,\u201d whined Musk at the weekend, in comments promptly reported by the legacy media. Also: you own a media platform, shithead \u2013 please don\u2019t try to \u201cmy struggle\u201d this one. Other looking-glass lunacies include Musk\u2019s regular assertions that Kamala Harris will end democracy, which he makes while appearing to buy votes in support of a man who has already sparked one insurrection and has explicitly promised to be \u201ca dictator\u201d on day one of his presidency.</p> <p>They say democracy dies in darkness, but it currently appears to be suffering serious breathing issues under full stage lights. In fact, watching Musk go all-out for Trump, it\u2019s hard not to get ominous circle-of-life vibes, and feel like you\u2019re watching the simultaneous live birth of an American oligarchy. There have been vested interests as long as there has been US politics, of course. But no robber baron of the Gilded Age was ever this relatively rich, or as artlessly open about what \u2013 and whom \u2013 a relatively tiny amount of money can buy.</p> <ul> <li><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p>A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.

      "bodyText": "For a guy who has spent his entire life making \u201cI am very rich\u201d the keystone of his personal brand, there is something quite poignant about watching Donald Trump get financially cucked by Elon Musk on stage every night. Musk is much younger, much richer, and has had a much more successful series of hair transplants. But needs must, it seems. As you might be aware, Musk has recently decided to update the tired dystopian fiction trope in which impoverished citizens are forced to compete in deadly gameshows where the winner gets a life-changingly glittering prize, and the losers are killed for sport. In Elon\u2019s rebooted version, the richest man in the world is giving struggling voters the chance to win a million dollars if they sign a \u201cpetition\u201d in favour of free speech and the right to bear arms. You get $47 (\u00a336) just for signing up \u2013 $100 in Pennsylvania, for some reason! \u2013 and only registered voters can apply. As long as they leave their names \u2013 and addresses, for some reason! \u2013 they\u2019re all good to enter the lottery pit. Also, it\u2019s not fictional but real, and it\u2019s happening in swing states every single day from now until the election in two weeks\u2019 time. On Saturday, Musk presented his first state-of-the-art cardboard cheque for $1m to a man at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. On Sunday, it was the turn of a woman at a town hall in Pittsburgh. On Monday, his Pac (political action committee) launched a drive against election interference, because hey \u2013 above all, he\u2019s an ironist. Like so many of the previous new lows of this campaign, once this tactic manifests itself you immediately find yourself thinking: of course. Of course, of course. Of course Musk, 53, would become a dark mirror version of MrBeast, and use the YouTube giveaway playbook to go viral in the election endgame. It\u2019s at once completely shocking, and also an October not-even-a-surprise. Perhaps the only mirthless smile it can raise is when you consider the utter yesteryearing it represents for Hollywood. It felt quaint even at the time, but do recall George Clooney spouting off last year about how indispensable Hollywood could be to political campaigns. \u201cI always just say,\u201d George just said, \u201clook, everybody keeps coming into Hollywood for cash, and they don\u2019t come to us for the one thing we do better than anybody, which is tell stories.\u201d Mm. And yet here we are, with the dark stars of the election bypassing the gold-standard magic of a movie industry everyone can see is in crisis, and taking their inspo from YouTube, which isn\u2019t. Anyway, in scenes also some-way-past familiar: the old good-chap structures of political life are revealed as simply unable to cope with bad chaps who decline to play by the unwritten rules. In fact, even the written rules seem to be in doubt. Is Musk\u2019s stunt legal? Those scrambling to respond to this question are once again falling back on the old \u201cuncharted territory\u201d descriptor. Alas, if you were hoping we could get a couple of cartographers out of bed for this one \u2013 like, yesterday? \u2013 then prepare for disappointment. What we have instead are leisurely headlines such as \u201cElon Musk\u2019s pledge for daily $1 million giveaways draw legal questions\u201d. The Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, opined on Monday of the giveaways that \u201cI think it\u2019s something that law enforcement could take a look at\u201d. \u201cCould take a look at\u201d, questions being \u201cdrawn\u201d \u2013 I can\u2019t help feeling the vocabulary choices here indicate the sort of mid-tier to-do list priority that no doubt the relevant cops/jurisprudence professors will get around to solving in a few weeks\u2019 time. No particular reason you\u2019d want to rush this one. Is there? In the meantime, seemingly nightly, we have the world\u2019s richest man on stage in service of Donald Trump. Or will it turn out to be the other way round? Only time will show, but given Musk is being touted for some kind of anti-regulation role at the same time as his businesses are involved in multiple anti-regulation lawsuits \u2026 let\u2019s just say this could go either way. In some ways, both parties could use a hand. And yet, neither is an underdog. However many years we are through the looking-glass now, I still boggle at the utter WTF-ery of Trump and Musk being able to present themselves as rank outsiders oppressed by the elites. \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019re having is, how do we get the public to know about this petition because the legacy media won\u2019t report on it,\u201d whined Musk at the weekend, in comments promptly reported by the legacy media. Also: you own a media platform, shithead \u2013 please don\u2019t try to \u201cmy struggle\u201d this one. Other looking-glass lunacies include Musk\u2019s regular assertions that Kamala Harris will end democracy, which he makes while appearing to buy votes in support of a man who has already sparked one insurrection and has explicitly promised to be \u201ca dictator\u201d on day one of his presidency. They say democracy dies in darkness, but it currently appears to be suffering serious breathing issues under full stage lights. In fact, watching Musk go all-out for Trump, it\u2019s hard not to get ominous circle-of-life vibes, and feel like you\u2019re watching the simultaneous live birth of an American oligarchy. There have been vested interests as long as there has been US politics, of course. But no robber baron of the Gilded Age was ever this relatively rich, or as artlessly open about what \u2013 and whom \u2013 a relatively tiny amount of money can buy.

Like most people in my liberal social circle, my reaction to the movie\u2019s existence was essentially: why? Why watch two hours of a de-handsomed (though still recognizable) Sebastian Stan as the young real estate mogul, and Jeremy Strong as his mentor Roy Cohn, go through events I already know \u2013 if not in exact detail, than certainly in spirit \u2013 in the life of a man I actively wish I knew less about?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/05/apprentice-trump-movie-ali-abbasi\">\u2018I\u2019m fine with people bashing us\u2019: inside the controversial Trump biopic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet I found the film, written by Vanity Fair\u2019s Trump chronicler Gabriel Sherman and directed by Iranian Danish film-maker Ali Abbasi, to be surprising. Not in material \u2013 even if you\u2019re not the most well read on Trump prior to his presidential campaign in 2015, his public character has long been consistent \u2013 but in its straightforward approach to depict the life of the former president. Though predictably dismissed by Republican figures and Trump himself as a hack job (or more specifically, \u201ca cheap, defamatory and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country\u201d, as Trump <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/donald-trump-the-apprentice-reaction-fake-classless-1236031493/\">wrote on Truth Social</a>), The Apprentice is an overall sincere movie, attempting to depict a highly contentious figure as close to the emotional truth as possible, while remaining entertaining. As Sherman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/05/apprentice-trump-movie-ali-abbasi\">told</a> me before its release: \u201cIt\u2019s such a universal story about the apprentice outstripping the master \u2026 I hope people can experience it on its own terms and not bring all their political baggage to it.\u201d</p> <p>A nice sentiment, which meant, unfortunately, that it was never going to go down well with highly polarized American audiences. I remember thinking, as I watched Stan do as decent a job as possible at playing a man whose tics are known by tens of millions, as Strong effectively conveyed Cohn\u2019s lizardly stare and calm ruthlessness, that it wouldn\u2019t really matter how well The Apprentice delivered on its self-appointed mission to dig into the character of Donald Trump. American audiences, most of whom are not keen to set aside political baggage this close to an election, wouldn\u2019t bite; this could only appeal to people outside the US, who either do not have to think about him every day or do not possess some native understanding of Trump\u2019s distinctly American celebrity.</p> <p>To wit: the film, following a protracted and difficult distribution search that nearly killed the movie, made just <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl655458305/weekend/\">$1.6m in 1,740 US theaters</a> during its opening weekend \u2013 a flop, particularly for a film with awards aspirations. Unsurprisingly, it found most of its viewers in large, urban liberal enclaves such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington DC. But The Apprentice has performed relatively well overseas \u2013 it <a href=\"https://www.screendaily.com/news/the-wild-robot-in-31m-debut-at-uk-ireland-box-office-the-apprentice-opens-third/5198352.article\">made $835,000</a> in its opening weekend in the UK, landing behind The Wild Robot and Smile 2 (the rule is usually to view it as representing a 10th of the US box office), and <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl655458305/weekend/\">over $623,000</a> in 319 theaters in France.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tXEN0WNJUg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0tXEN0WNJUg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Part of the film\u2019s domestic box office woes owe to business issues outside the film-makers\u2019 control. After a splashy premiere and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/donald-trump-movie-the-apprentice-cannes-standing-ovation-1235904113/\">positive critical reception</a> at the Cannes film festival in May, The Apprentice <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/the-apprentice-film-donald-trump-interview-1236026525/#recipient_hashed=dc68e911e0e159ea2be7d14e75501937a661c79bb7cb043f0285328fc25396f1&amp;recipient_salt=5fb4e1319ff3fed437d5b8912f36fca61ad1c1a9c8cb1fc7b07a808ee9fed6f8&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=Breaking%20News&amp;utm_content=557202_10-09-2024&amp;utm_term=9339546\">struggled to find distribution</a>, partly due to Trump\u2019s political influence and partly due to old-fashioned market timidity. Days after the premiere, reports emerged that the film\u2019s principal financier, Kinematics \u2013 founded by the son-in-law of billionaire Trump donor Dan Snyder \u2013 objected to a scene depicting Trump\u2019s alleged rape of his wife Ivana (Maria Bakalova). (The scene, as with everything in The Apprentice, is grounded in some historical record; Ivana recounted the event in a 1990 divorce deposition, under oath.) Simultaneously, Trump\u2019s legal team issued a cease and desist order, threatening to sue. The objections had their intended chilling effect \u2013 according to the film-makers, every major American distributor and streaming service passed.</p> <p>The Apprentice has only reached theaters thanks to a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/the-apprentice-movie-kickstarter-1235991544/\">Kickstarter campaign</a> (dubbed \u201cRelease the Apprentice\u201d), a last-minute buyout of Kinetics and an 11th-hour save by renegade indie outlet Briarcliff Entertainment. The machinations effectively gave Briarcliff only five weeks to market the film \u2013 a brief window further hampered by US networks <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/10/the-apprentice-ads-cbs-abc-donald-trump-1236105174/\">refusing to air spots</a> during political coverage, not to mention <a href=\"https://x.com/WriterPaulBond/status/1840596769157382214\">boycott calls</a> from Republicans such as Mike Huckabee.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/the-apprentice-review-cartoon-version-of-chump-in-chief-donald-trumps-early-years\">The Apprentice review \u2013 cartoon version of chump-in-chief Donald Trump\u2019s early years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the film is, ultimately, an outsiders\u2019 perspective of Donald Trump (most of the cast and crew hail from Europe or Canada) \u2013 perhaps crucial for handling recent American history fairly, though always a tough sell to US audiences \u2013 made with appeals to objectivity and curiosity that will only work on those outside the US context. The Apprentice is overall well made and well acted, and generally earnest in vivifying the extensive reporting done on arguably the most famous living American. It is not <em>not</em> worth watching, as a film about a student gradually eclipsing his teacher in a bankrupt New York, and yet also not particularly insightful on its subject.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I did not want to watch The Apprentice, the new film chronicling Donald Trump\u2019s ascendancy through 1970s and 80s New York. Like most people in my liberal social circle, my reaction to the movie\u2019s existence was essentially: why? Why watch two hours of a de-handsomed (though still recognizable) Sebastian Stan as the young real estate mogul, and Jeremy Strong as his mentor Roy Cohn, go through events I already know \u2013 if not in exact detail, than certainly in spirit \u2013 in the life of a man I actively wish I knew less about? And yet I found the film, written by Vanity Fair\u2019s Trump chronicler Gabriel Sherman and directed by Iranian Danish film-maker Ali Abbasi, to be surprising. Not in material \u2013 even if you\u2019re not the most well read on Trump prior to his presidential campaign in 2015, his public character has long been consistent \u2013 but in its straightforward approach to depict the life of the former president. Though predictably dismissed by Republican figures and Trump himself as a hack job (or more specifically, \u201ca cheap, defamatory and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country\u201d, as Trump wrote on Truth Social), The Apprentice is an overall sincere movie, attempting to depict a highly contentious figure as close to the emotional truth as possible, while remaining entertaining. As Sherman told me before its release: \u201cIt\u2019s such a universal story about the apprentice outstripping the master \u2026 I hope people can experience it on its own terms and not bring all their political baggage to it.\u201d A nice sentiment, which meant, unfortunately, that it was never going to go down well with highly polarized American audiences. I remember thinking, as I watched Stan do as decent a job as possible at playing a man whose tics are known by tens of millions, as Strong effectively conveyed Cohn\u2019s lizardly stare and calm ruthlessness, that it wouldn\u2019t really matter how well The Apprentice delivered on its self-appointed mission to dig into the character of Donald Trump. American audiences, most of whom are not keen to set aside political baggage this close to an election, wouldn\u2019t bite; this could only appeal to people outside the US, who either do not have to think about him every day or do not possess some native understanding of Trump\u2019s distinctly American celebrity. To wit: the film, following a protracted and difficult distribution search that nearly killed the movie, made just $1.6m in 1,740 US theaters during its opening weekend \u2013 a flop, particularly for a film with awards aspirations. Unsurprisingly, it found most of its viewers in large, urban liberal enclaves such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington DC. But The Apprentice has performed relatively well overseas \u2013 it made $835,000 in its opening weekend in the UK, landing behind The Wild Robot and Smile 2 (the rule is usually to view it as representing a 10th of the US box office), and over $623,000 in 319 theaters in France. Part of the film\u2019s domestic box office woes owe to business issues outside the film-makers\u2019 control. After a splashy premiere and positive critical reception at the Cannes film festival in May, The Apprentice struggled to find distribution, partly due to Trump\u2019s political influence and partly due to old-fashioned market timidity. Days after the premiere, reports emerged that the film\u2019s principal financier, Kinematics \u2013 founded by the son-in-law of billionaire Trump donor Dan Snyder \u2013 objected to a scene depicting Trump\u2019s alleged rape of his wife Ivana (Maria Bakalova). (The scene, as with everything in The Apprentice, is grounded in some historical record; Ivana recounted the event in a 1990 divorce deposition, under oath.) Simultaneously, Trump\u2019s legal team issued a cease and desist order, threatening to sue. The objections had their intended chilling effect \u2013 according to the film-makers, every major American distributor and streaming service passed. The Apprentice has only reached theaters thanks to a Kickstarter campaign (dubbed \u201cRelease the Apprentice\u201d), a last-minute buyout of Kinetics and an 11th-hour save by renegade indie outlet Briarcliff Entertainment. The machinations effectively gave Briarcliff only five weeks to market the film \u2013 a brief window further hampered by US networks refusing to air spots during political coverage, not to mention boycott calls from Republicans such as Mike Huckabee. But the film is, ultimately, an outsiders\u2019 perspective of Donald Trump (most of the cast and crew hail from Europe or Canada) \u2013 perhaps crucial for handling recent American history fairly, though always a tough sell to US audiences \u2013 made with appeals to objectivity and curiosity that will only work on those outside the US context. The Apprentice is overall well made and well acted, and generally earnest in vivifying the extensive reporting done on arguably the most famous living American. It is not not worth watching, as a film about a student gradually eclipsing his teacher in a bankrupt New York, and yet also not particularly insightful on its subject. Though to be fair, little is \u2013 despite Republicans\u2019 continued delusions of seriousness, Trump has been clearly who he is for a long, long time, and in the news on a daily basis for going on a decade. There is nothing to say that has not been said. Still, I agree, rationally, with the film-makers\u2019 pleas to give it a chance, to resist corporate censorship, to see the film as a chance to critique, as Abbasi put it, the \u201csocial Darwinism that is built-in in American society, that didn\u2019t come with Trump and will not end with Trump\u201d. To accept that, to paraphrase executive producer James Shani, it may not teach you anything new, but will make you feel something different. (Discomfort, for one, or the limitations of one\u2019s pre-existing exhaustion.) But I also understand why, all good and open-minded and artistic intentions aside, it is falling on deaf ears in this country.",

      "body": "<p>Hello, and welcome to TechScape. I\u2019m Blake Montgomery, technology news editor at the Guardian US. Today in TechScape I\u2019m deciphering Elon Musk\u2019s global political goals, a remarkable documentary filmed within World of Warcraft, polling on support for school phone bans, and cats on TikTok. Thank you for joining me. First, let\u2019s talk about Musk\u2019s global politics.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Musk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/elon-musk-promises-to-award-1m-every-day-to-voters-as-he-steps-up-campaigning-for-trump\">pledged to give away $1m a day</a> to registered voters in battleground states in the US who sign his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/feb/21/super-pacs-campaign-finance-explained\">Pac</a>\u2019s petition in support of the first and second amendments. He awarded the first prize, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/election-elon-musk-trump-pennsylvania\">a novelty check the size of a kitchen island</a>, at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday and the second on Sunday in Pittsburgh. He says he\u2019ll keep doing it until the election on 5 November. The stunt is potentially illegal, experts say.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p><strong>Why is Musk doing this? What does he want?</strong></p> <p>My colleagues Nick Robins-Early and Rachel Leingang <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/18/elon-musk-trump-election-influence\">published a piece</a> last week looking at Musk\u2019s inescapable influence on the US presidential election. The article dives into the past several months of Musk\u2019s political activities, but I was particularly fascinated by one question it posed: is deregulation the driving motivation behind Musk\u2019s political endeavors across the globe? Is all this spending and campaigning about cutting government departments?</p> <p>These constant fights with the full alphabet of regulatory agencies has coincided with Musk making numerous public statements in favor of deregulation, as well as calling for a full-scale audit of the federal government. That idea has found purchase with Trump, who announced in September that he would launch a Musk-led government efficiency commission that would audit federal agencies for places to cut. Musk wants to call it the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, invoking one of his favorite memes, an expressive shiba inu.</p>    <p>Although the plan is vague on details and fails to address the obvious conflict of interest in Musk auditing the regulators that oversee his companies, both Trump and Musk have repeatedly brought up the idea of Musk holding some role in a potential Trump administration. During an appearance on Fox News earlier this week, Trump said that he would create a new position called \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d and appoint Musk.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying to do this,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>Musk\u2019s fight for fewer government agencies is not limited to the US, though. Sometimes, his fights with \u201cthe regulators\u201d set him against other billionaires. In India, Musk is fighting with the government over the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/musk-reacts-ambani-lobbying-calls-any-india-move-auction-satellite-spectrum-2024-10-15/\">distribution of satellite broadband</a> and emerging victorious over Mukesh Ambani. Asia\u2019s richest man had sought terms more favorable to his own telecommunications empire.</p> <p>He has proclaimed himself a \u201cfree-speech absolutist\u201d and complained about the regulators of speech. When the UK was in the throes of violent race riots a month after its general election, Musk tweeted, \u201cCivil war is inevitable,\u201d and posted a cartoon showing a character in an electric chair, claiming that this would be the government\u2019s punishment for free speech in the UK by 2030. He has made similar critiques of the California government and Joe Biden\u2019s administration.</p> <p>His fight for deregulation regularly pits him against the judiciary. Last month, Brazil blocked access to X over its failure to comply with a judge\u2019s orders and then fined Starlink, a subsidiary of SpaceX, for its sister company\u2019s transgressions. Musk and X <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/08/musks-x-reinstated-in-brazil-after-complying-with-supreme-court-demands\">eventually complied</a>.</p> <p>Recently, some of the regulators have taken a new tack: they\u2019re starting to penalize one Musk company for what another Musk company (or Musk himself) does.</p> <p>Last week, Europe\u2019s regulators took a page out of Brazil\u2019s book, communicating to lawyers at X that the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-17/musk-s-empire-risks-being-targeted-by-eu-for-potential-x-fines?sref=fqqmZ8gi\">EU could levy fines</a> against the social media company for failing to comply with the Digital Services Act. Crucially, the regulators suggest calculating that tax not just based on X\u2019s revenues, but the total revenue of Musk\u2019s businesses. The penalty, presumably much higher, could financially hobble the social media platform.</p> <p>In California, a coastal commission cited Musk\u2019s propensity to tweet misinformation during a vote to reject a petition by SpaceX and the US air force to launch more rockets from a base on a Santa Barbara beach. Musk sued in response, alleging political bias and first amendment violations. He just wants to be left alone to launch rockets and tweet and spend tens of millions on the presidential election in peace.</p> <p>Read the full story on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/18/elon-musk-trump-election-influence\">Musk\u2019s omnipresent campaigning</a>.</p> <h2>A remarkable documentary makes the case for life online</h2>    <p><strong>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</strong> follows the legacy of Mats Steen, a Norwegian teenager who suffered from a degenerative disorder that consigned him to a wheelchair for much of his 25-year life.</p> <p>As Steen became more dependent on his wheelchair and breathing apparatus, he spent increasing amounts of time playing World of Warcraft and other games, sometimes 12 hours a day. The film takes place where he lived most of his life: online.</p> <p>Steen\u2019s parents worry about the negative effects of screen time on their son. They fear he will \u201cnever experience friendship, love, or to make a difference in other people\u2019s lives\u201d. But after his death, they come to find that the thing they despaired over provided him a lifeline, freeing him to do all the things they never thought he could. Steen\u2019s Warcraft character, Ibelin, led him to deep friendships, adventure and even digital romance. He left them his password when he died so they could discover his second life.</p>    <p>In a mirror to Steen\u2019s life, the film\u2019s action happens as much online as off. Shot on digital location in Azeroth, the setting of World of Warcraft, it follows recreations of Ibelin\u2019s conquests, conversations and relationships there. Closeup shots zoom in on avatars\u2019 expressions to simulate the presence and feelings of Steen and his friends, who speak about him as part of their Warcraft family. Each person recounts the profound positive effects of the in-game friendships they shared with Steen via Ibelin.</p> <p>Ibelin\u2019s scenes in Azeroth triumph in imbuing the actions of the fictional characters there with true significance. Ibelin shares a kiss at sunset with a date; he joins a family called Starlight; he lashes out at those closest to him in painful moments. These avatars comprise the entire emotional life of a group of friends. They offered hope to a boy whose own parents saw his life as truncated and lacking. Who is to say they aren\u2019t real?</p> <p>Anecdotal success stories of video games and social media are as old as the backlashes against both. What this documentary does differently, though, is situate the viewer within the screen alongside the subject. It is an immersive, empathetic approach, far superior to watching someone use a device from an isolating third-person perspective.</p> <p>The film arrives as parents the world over debate how much screen time is appropriate for children. Its argument that time spent digitally with friends carries palpable weight is made all the more compelling by its form. By relying on in-game cinematography, the film demonstrates the emotional heft of life online.</p> <p>The film comes to Netflix on 25 October.</p> <h2>On my iPhone</h2>    <p>This week, I\u2019m watching riveting videos of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTF96drPu/\">cats equipped with collar cameras</a>. The videos are marvels in camera stabilization technology as much as they are peeks into the secret lives of outdoor pets. A camera company has already <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTF9u1oJU/\">sponsored Mr Kitters</a>, who has become one of TikTok\u2019s main characters. Another feline star, the confrontational @max20499, is more of a villain. He loves to ambush an unsuspecting cat and tussle. To find him, the app suggests the search terms \u201cMaxwell the bully cat\u201d and \u201cMaxwell the bully cat met his match\u201d.</p> <h2>The UK banned students\u2019 phones from schools. Should US schools do the same?</h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/10/14/most-americans-back-cellphone-bans-during-class-but-fewer-support-all-day-restrictions/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=25-10-14%20Cellphone%20ban%20in%20schools%20short%20read&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=14865&amp;lea=3915490&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=a0DQm0000037FNBMA2\">Pew Research</a> published a poll last week surveying 5,110 US adults on cellphone bans in schools. The results might surprise you, as they did me. Quotes from the poll\u2019s findings:</p> <p>\u2022 68% of US adults say they support a ban on middle- and high-school students using cellphones during class.<br>\u2022 36% support banning middle- and high-school students from using cellphones during the school day.<br>\u2022 Younger adults are less supportive of cellphone bans, in class and for the entire school day. Fewer than half of adults under 30 (45%) say they support banning students from using cellphones during class. This share rises to 67% among those aged 30 to 49 and 80% among those aged 50 and older.<br>\u2022 Reasons why: among those who support a ban during class, almost all (98%) say a reason they back it is because students would have fewer distractions in class.<br>\u2022 Of those who oppose a ban, 86% say that parents should be able to reach their child when needed.</p> <h2>The wider TechScape</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/16/pushing-buttons-roblox-games-for-children\">With the safety of Roblox under scrutiny, how worried should parents be?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/first-edition-google-data-centres-environment\">What does Google\u2019s move into nuclear power mean for AI \u2013 and the world?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/17/ai-mediation-tool-may-help-reduce-culture-war-rifts-say-researchers\">How an AI meditation tool built by Google DeepMind may help reduce culture war rifts.</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/21/microsoft-launches-ai-employees-that-can-perform-some-business-tasks\">Microsoft has recruited \u2018AI employees\u2019 that can handle client queries.</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/08/techscape-silicon-valley-school-tech-fast-ai-training\">ICYMI: read a previous edition of TechScape about an elite Silicon Valley school testing a total fast from all tech.</a></p></li> </ul>",

He has made similar critiques of the California government and Joe Biden\u2019s administration. His fight for deregulation regularly pits him against the judiciary. Last month, Brazil blocked access to X over its failure to comply with a judge\u2019s orders and then fined Starlink, a subsidiary of SpaceX, for its sister company\u2019s transgressions. Musk and X eventually complied. Recently, some of the regulators have taken a new tack: they\u2019re starting to penalize one Musk company for what another Musk company (or Musk himself) does. Last week, Europe\u2019s regulators took a page out of Brazil\u2019s book, communicating to lawyers at X that the EU could levy fines against the social media company for failing to comply with the Digital Services Act. Crucially, the regulators suggest calculating that tax not just based on X\u2019s revenues, but the total revenue of Musk\u2019s businesses. The penalty, presumably much higher, could financially hobble the social media platform. In California, a coastal commission cited Musk\u2019s propensity to tweet misinformation during a vote to reject a petition by SpaceX and the US air force to launch more rockets from a base on a Santa Barbara beach. Musk sued in response, alleging political bias and first amendment violations. He just wants to be left alone to launch rockets and tweet and spend tens of millions on the presidential election in peace. Read the full story on Musk\u2019s omnipresent campaigning. A remarkable documentary makes the case for life online The Remarkable Life of Ibelin follows the legacy of Mats Steen, a Norwegian teenager who suffered from a degenerative disorder that consigned him to a wheelchair for much of his 25-year life. As Steen became more dependent on his wheelchair and breathing apparatus, he spent increasing amounts of time playing World of Warcraft and other games, sometimes 12 hours a day. The film takes place where he lived most of his life: online. Steen\u2019s parents worry about the negative effects of screen time on their son. They fear he will \u201cnever experience friendship, love, or to make a difference in other people\u2019s lives\u201d. But after his death, they come to find that the thing they despaired over provided him a lifeline, freeing him to do all the things they never thought he could. Steen\u2019s Warcraft character, Ibelin, led him to deep friendships, adventure and even digital romance. He left them his password when he died so they could discover his second life. In a mirror to Steen\u2019s life, the film\u2019s action happens as much online as off. Shot on digital location in Azeroth, the setting of World of Warcraft, it follows recreations of Ibelin\u2019s conquests, conversations and relationships there. Closeup shots zoom in on avatars\u2019 expressions to simulate the presence and feelings of Steen and his friends, who speak about him as part of their Warcraft family. Each person recounts the profound positive effects of the in-game friendships they shared with Steen via Ibelin. Ibelin\u2019s scenes in Azeroth triumph in imbuing the actions of the fictional characters there with true significance. Ibelin shares a kiss at sunset with a date; he joins a family called Starlight; he lashes out at those closest to him in painful moments. These avatars comprise the entire emotional life of a group of friends. They offered hope to a boy whose own parents saw his life as truncated and lacking. Who is to say they aren\u2019t real? Anecdotal success stories of video games and social media are as old as the backlashes against both. What this documentary does differently, though, is situate the viewer within the screen alongside the subject. It is an immersive, empathetic approach, far superior to watching someone use a device from an isolating third-person perspective. The film arrives as parents the world over debate how much screen time is appropriate for children. Its argument that time spent digitally with friends carries palpable weight is made all the more compelling by its form. By relying on in-game cinematography, the film demonstrates the emotional heft of life online. The film comes to Netflix on 25 October.

The UK banned students\u2019 phones from schools. Should US schools do the same? Pew Research published a poll last week surveying 5,110 US adults on cellphone bans in schools. The results might surprise you, as they did me. Quotes from the poll\u2019s findings: \u2022 68% of US adults say they support a ban on middle- and high-school students using cellphones during class. \u2022 36% support banning middle- and high-school students from using cellphones during the school day. \u2022 Younger adults are less supportive of cellphone bans, in class and for the entire school day. Fewer than half of adults under 30 (45%) say they support banning students from using cellphones during class. This share rises to 67% among those aged 30 to 49 and 80% among those aged 50 and older. \u2022 Reasons why: among those who support a ban during class, almost all (98%) say a reason they back it is because students would have fewer distractions in class. \u2022 Of those who oppose a ban, 86% say that parents should be able to reach their child when needed.

      "bodyText": "South Korea is considering directly supplying weapons to Ukraine as evidence increases that North Korean soldiers are preparing to assist Russia in its war against Ukraine. South Korea\u2019s spy agency (NIS) said last week that North Korea had shipped 1,500 special forces personnel to Russia\u2019s far east for training and acclimatising at local military bases for future combat alongside Moscow\u2019s troops in Ukraine. Local media, citing the NIS, said Pyongyang had decided to dispatch 12,000 troops, formed into four brigades, to Russia. A senior official at the office of South Korea\u2019s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, said on Tuesday that Seoul could consider providing defensive and lethal weapons to Ukraine depending on developments. \u201cWe would consider supplying weapons for defensive purposes as part of the step-by-step scenarios, and if it seems they are going too far, we might also consider offensive use,\u201d the presidential official told reporters, signalling Seoul\u2019s most proactive position towards arming Ukraine to date. The development underscores the potential for a divided Korean peninsula to become entangled in the conflict. The president\u2019s comment came after South Korea\u2019s national security council held an emergency meeting to explore its responses over North Korea\u2019s increasing military ties with Russia. South Korea, home to some of the world\u2019s largest stockpiles of artillery shells, has provided humanitarian aid and other support to Ukraine, while joining western-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But it has not directly provided arms to Kyiv, citing a longstanding policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Seoul\u2019s policy shift would be welcomed by Kyiv, which is facing a desperate shortage of munitions. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, earlier called for a \u201cstrong response\u201d from international partners to North Korea\u2019s involvement in the ongoing war. Meanwhile, a series of clips have surfaced over the past few days, reportedly showing North Korean soldiers training in Russia. On Sunday, the Ukrainian strategic communication and information security centre circulated a video appearing to show North Korean soldiers receiving uniforms and equipment at the Sergeevka training ground in the far east of Russia. Astra, an independent Russian outlet, published two clips on Tuesday of what appear to be North Korean soldiers standing outside a military base. The men are heard speaking in Korean, with an instructor telling soldiers to \u201ccome inside\u201d the building. Independent researchers have geolocated the clips to the Sergeevka training ground. The Kremlin has declined to directly answer a question on whether or not North Korean troops were going to fight in Ukraine but said that it was Moscow\u2019s sovereign right to develop ties with Pyongyang in all areas. North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who first met in 2019, have been seeking greater military and economic cooperation to counter their growing international isolation prompted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. In June, the two leaders signed a pact that includes a clause requiring the countries to come to each other\u2019s aid if either is attacked. The UK on Monday said that it \u201cassesses that it is highly likely North Korea has agreed to send troops to support Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine\u201d. \u201cIt seems that the harder Putin finds it to recruit Russians to be cannon fodder, the more willing he is to rely on the DPRK [North Korea] in his illegal war,\u201d Dame Barbara Woodward, the permanent UK representative to the United Nations, said while speaking in New York. \u201cPutin is clearly desperate.

      "body": "<p>\u201cPeople seem to find blind baking annoying because they think it\u2019s slightly pointless,\u201d says Gelf Alderson, culinary director at River Cottage and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/river-cottage-great-pies-9781526639172/\">Great Pies</a>. \u201cAfter all, lots of recipes say to blind bake for only 15-20 minutes, which is just not correct.\u201d Instead, he insists, you need to do so for at least 35-40 minutes, and at a low oven temperature, too \u2013 160C-170C (depending on your oven): \u201cIf someone has never blind baked for that length of time, they\u2019ll never have seen a really nice result, which is why it would feel a bit pointless.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re dealing with a wet, liquidy filling in an open tart (think custard or chocolate, or an eggy quiche), and you want a fine, crisp pastry case, you simply won\u2019t achieve this any other way, says Shaheen Peerbhai, chef-owner of <a href=\"https://mielbakery.co.uk/\">Miel Bakery</a> in London, adding that it\u2019s worth remembering that the crust is \u201cpart of the experience, and not just a case. It\u2019s important to respect that and give it its dues.\u201d</p> <p>You can save a bit of time by leaving an overhang before popping it in the oven, though: \u201cA good 2cm will keep the pastry from shrinking back in the case, and then you can avoid the chill time,\u201d Alderson says. Then, when it comes to trimming the cooked case, reach for a peeler: \u201cIt\u2019s far less harsh than a serrated knife, and you\u2019ll get a much smoother finish.\u201d</p> <p>Peerbhai does, however, have a strategy for dodging blind baking when it comes to the likes of jam tortes. \u201cYou need a barrier between the crust and the fruit, though, but that can come from an almond or other nut cream,\u201d she says, so, essentially, we\u2019re talking frangipane here. This will take the moisture from the fruit while ensuring that the crust is nice and crunchy. \u201cPlus, you get a third texture going on from the cream.\u201d</p> <p>Alternatively, blind-baking haters could throw caution to the wind and simply rely on a really hot oven, though, as Alderson points out, this tactic isn\u2019t foolproof: \u201cLeave a good overhang, then prick the base and sides with a fork \u2013 it\u2019s important to do this all the way through the pastry, so the steam doesn\u2019t get trapped underneath [and turn things soggy].\u201d Then shock it in a hot oven (about 200C-210C), where the high heat causes the pastry to set and dry rapidly. \u201cThis is a riskier way of blind baking,\u201d he warns, \u201cbut if you get it right, you\u2019ll have that requisite crisp finish.\u201d Be warned, however: the pastry might well rise in the middle as a result, or colour excessively around the edges.</p> <p>For this reason, if you really can\u2019t be doing with blind baking at all, Alderson says it\u2019s much safer to go for something such as a meat pie and be done with it: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got pastry on the bottom, then filling, and then pastry on the top, I wouldn\u2019t bother blind baking, because the pie bakes for so long that the pastry\u2019s going to soften anyway,\u201d he says. Plus, you\u2019re expecting \u2013 not to mention wanting \u2013 that softer finish, anyway, especially once it\u2019s been doused in gravy. </p> <ul> <li><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

      "bodyText": "\u201cPeople seem to find blind baking annoying because they think it\u2019s slightly pointless,\u201d says Gelf Alderson, culinary director at River Cottage and author of Great Pies. \u201cAfter all, lots of recipes say to blind bake for only 15-20 minutes, which is just not correct.\u201d Instead, he insists, you need to do so for at least 35-40 minutes, and at a low oven temperature, too \u2013 160C-170C (depending on your oven): \u201cIf someone has never blind baked for that length of time, they\u2019ll never have seen a really nice result, which is why it would feel a bit pointless.\u201d If you\u2019re dealing with a wet, liquidy filling in an open tart (think custard or chocolate, or an eggy quiche), and you want a fine, crisp pastry case, you simply won\u2019t achieve this any other way, says Shaheen Peerbhai, chef-owner of Miel Bakery in London, adding that it\u2019s worth remembering that the crust is \u201cpart of the experience, and not just a case. It\u2019s important to respect that and give it its dues.\u201d You can save a bit of time by leaving an overhang before popping it in the oven, though: \u201cA good 2cm will keep the pastry from shrinking back in the case, and then you can avoid the chill time,\u201d Alderson says. Then, when it comes to trimming the cooked case, reach for a peeler: \u201cIt\u2019s far less harsh than a serrated knife, and you\u2019ll get a much smoother finish.\u201d Peerbhai does, however, have a strategy for dodging blind baking when it comes to the likes of jam tortes. \u201cYou need a barrier between the crust and the fruit, though, but that can come from an almond or other nut cream,\u201d she says, so, essentially, we\u2019re talking frangipane here. This will take the moisture from the fruit while ensuring that the crust is nice and crunchy. \u201cPlus, you get a third texture going on from the cream.\u201d Alternatively, blind-baking haters could throw caution to the wind and simply rely on a really hot oven, though, as Alderson points out, this tactic isn\u2019t foolproof: \u201cLeave a good overhang, then prick the base and sides with a fork \u2013 it\u2019s important to do this all the way through the pastry, so the steam doesn\u2019t get trapped underneath [and turn things soggy].\u201d Then shock it in a hot oven (about 200C-210C), where the high heat causes the pastry to set and dry rapidly. \u201cThis is a riskier way of blind baking,\u201d he warns, \u201cbut if you get it right, you\u2019ll have that requisite crisp finish.\u201d Be warned, however: the pastry might well rise in the middle as a result, or colour excessively around the edges. For this reason, if you really can\u2019t be doing with blind baking at all, Alderson says it\u2019s much safer to go for something such as a meat pie and be done with it: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got pastry on the bottom, then filling, and then pastry on the top, I wouldn\u2019t bother blind baking, because the pie bakes for so long that the pastry\u2019s going to soften anyway,\u201d he says. Plus, you\u2019re expecting \u2013 not to mention wanting \u2013 that softer finish, anyway, especially once it\u2019s been doused in gravy. Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com",

Three hours later, a rogue driver plowed his car into mine and shattered my wrist in three places.</p> <p>Fifty-seven is relatively young for a Dexa \u2013 or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry \u2013 scan, which measures bone density, or the amount of calcium and minerals in your bones.

Strober had become alarmed by how many of their fiftysomething patients were finding that they had the bones of an octogenarian.</p> <p>The results of my Dexa scan arrived in my inbox a week after my car crash: I had full-blown osteoporosis.</p> <p>I was still recovering from multiple injuries, so the diagnosis took a back seat. I was also under the impression \u2013 because of my age, ignorance and the invisible, pain-free pathogenesis of osteoporosis \u2013 that loss of bone mass was less of an immediate threat to my health and wellbeing than my visible injuries. But, in fact, my osteoporosis had made me more susceptible to that broken wrist. Without intervention, osteoporotic bones simply deteriorate and grow increasingly more brittle with age. They also take longer to heal from fractures.</p> <p>I can attest to that: 15 months later, it still hurts to hold a pitcher of water.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/18/what-is-dmer-breastfeeding\">Why do I feel a wave of sadness before breastfeeding?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Osteoporosis comes from <em>osteo</em> (from <em>ost\u00e9on</em>, Greek for bone) and <em>poros</em> (Greek for pore or passage). It describes just that: a hollowing out and reduction of bone mass such that the tiny holes that naturally occur in our bones widen into a gaping, irregular lattice. Osteoporosis occurs predominantly in <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/arthritis-info/osteoporosis-info/#:~:text=Using%20the%20WHO%20definition%20of,or%20greater(ref%203).\">postmenopausal women</a>. A woman in her 50s has a <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/arthritis-info/osteoporosis-info/\">14% chance</a> of having it. By age 80, she has a 70% chance.</p> <p>It begins when the creation of new bone can no longer keep up with the loss of old bone. These hollowed-out bones are far more prone to breakage, particularly in the hip, spine and, yes, wrist. The survival rate for women, following a hip fracture, is <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jbmrplus/article/8/5/ziae022/7612067\">worse than most cancers</a>: half will be dead in five years. Yes, men get osteoporosis, too, but the percentages are much lower. A <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db405.htm#:~:text=Crude%20estimates%20are%2012.0%25%20for,%2C%20and%20both%20is%202.0%25.\">crude estimate</a> for men over 50 is 4.2%, and authorities <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/osteoporosis-screening\">don\u2019t recommend</a> routine bone density testing, either for men or for women my age.</p> <p>But if I\u2019ve learned anything over the course of my work reporting on women\u2019s health, it\u2019s that most of what we\u2019ve been told often turns out to be wrong, and none of it has been sufficiently studied, if at all. Unsurprisingly, trying to figure out how to treat my osteoporosis has only confirmed this.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I had several risk factors for osteoporosis: small body frame (5ft 2in, thin), family history (including a great aunt who died from a broken hip), ethnicity (white; Asians are also more prone) and a prior history of fractures. So my primary care provider had agreed it couldn\u2019t hurt to get a Dexa scan at 57 as a baseline. At my annual physical, my vitamin D levels were below normal \u2013 another red flag. My gynecologist also thought it a good idea and ordered the scan, which took three months to schedule.</p> <p>The resulting diagnosis of full-blown osteoporosis shocked me. I\u2019m an active woman in good shape for my age. I don\u2019t smoke or drink. I eat a balanced diet. I do yoga twice weekly, ride my bike and walk 10,000 steps every day. Yet my Dexa results were similar to those of an 80-year-old woman.</p>    <p>Dexa scan results include T-score numbers, which indicate how many standard deviation units below the mean the subject\u2019s bones have deteriorated in three key places for breakage: lumbar spine, femoral neck and hip. The mean is 0, for a healthy young person with strong bones. Any score between -1 and 0 is considered healthy. Scores from -1 to -2.5 point to osteopenia, which is less a clinical diagnosis and more an indication that bone mass loss has begun. Any score below -2.5 indicates osteoporosis.</p> <p>My hip T-score was -2, but my lumbar spine T-score was -3.2; my left femoral neck was -2.7. \u201cThe patient has Osteoporosis lumbar spine, left femoral neck,\u201d the radiologist wrote in my report. \u201cPatient fracture risk is elevated.\u201d</p> <p>After recovering from the crash, I set out in search of answers. But even I, a woman who writes about women\u2019s health, had no idea which specialist to contact. An orthopedist? A rheumatologist? An endocrinologist? A gerontologist? Some combination of all four?</p> <p>The consensus among friends, family and Google was to seek out an endocrinologist. Endocrinologists treat diseases of hormonal imbalance. Osteoporosis, I was surprised to learn, is a hormone-related disease \u2013 a drop in estrogen or an overactive thyroid, parathyroid or adrenal gland can all weaken bones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, \u2018Well Actually\u2019, then \u2018Read more on living a good life in a complex world,\u2019 then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say \u2018More from this section\u2019\u00a0\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But the sole endocrinologist in network for my insurance who was taking new patients did not have an appointment for another six months.</p> <p>While I waited, I scheduled a Zoom with <a href=\"https://deborahcopaken.substack.com/p/osteoporosis-is-the-silent-killer?utm_source=publication-search\">Dr Mary O\u2019Connor</a>, an orthopedic surgeon I\u2019d previously interviewed for the launch of her book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zoFNi4\">Taking Care of You: The Empowered Woman\u2019s Guide to Better Health</a>. At her urging, I added a daily 2000 IU Vitamin D3 supplement and upped my intake of calcium-rich foods. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have adequate vitamin D3,\u201d she explained, \u201cyou cannot absorb the calcium that you eat.\u201d She also suggested lifting weights, so I bought some dumbbells and found a 30-minute online workout I <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-vGcK_1glIk?si=qsw2F7ZP8AK-ovEA\">actually liked</a>.</p>    <p>While researching specialists, I noticed that many rheumatologists included osteoporosis as an area of expertise. They mostly treat connective tissue disorders, but I figured they could at least do the bloodwork I needed.</p> <p>Dr Lauren Wong, a rheumatologist from NYU Langone, one of those rare physicians who treats you as an equal, ordered a ton of that bloodwork. At my follow-up, she had some answers. \u201cYou have hyperparathyroidism,\u201d she told me: my PTH, or parathyroid hormone, levels had come back unnaturally high. Parathyroid hormone, she explained, regulates our calcium levels, and too much parathyroid hormone can contribute to osteoporosis by triggering the <a href=\"https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteoporosis/causes/hyperparathyroidism/#:~:text=If%20the%20parathyroid%20glands%20are,breakdown%20and%20renewal%20of%20bone).\">release of calcium</a> from bone stores. Wong agreed I needed to see an endocrinologist and possibly a parathyroid surgeon after that.</p> <p>\u201cHyperpara \u2026 what?\u201d I\u2019d never heard of this hard-to-pronounce disease.</p> <p>My endocrinology appointment was still several months away \u2013 God bless America \u2013 so I sought the advice of <a href=\"https://deborahcopaken.substack.com/p/an-ounce-of-prevention-part-i\">Dr Babak Larian</a>, a parathyroid surgeon in LA with an excellent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@LarianMD\">YouTube channel</a> about hyperparathyroidism. Over Zoom, Larian told me he thought it was absolutely ridiculous that women in this country are advised to get Dexa scans at 65, given that menopause begins in our late 40s or early 50s. \u201cI think 50 should be the standard,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Larian also explained that we have extremely poor statistics on the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism in the US. \u201cWe\u2019re so far off the mark,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I don\u2019t even know where to start the conversation.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cbecause this is a disease mainly of women, they are [often] not diagnosed\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/primary-hyperparathyroidism\">Endocrine Society</a> states that the incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in the US is somewhere between 0.1% and 0.7%; women and African Americans are more prone to it. However, a recent <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25059283/\">retroactive survey in Canada</a> found that 5% of Canada\u2019s population have some form of hyperparathyroidism. Larian believes hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by menopause, and thus that more than 5% of menopausal women have it. But they are completely unaware of this because its symptoms \u2013 such as fatigue, muscle weakness, depression, memory problems \u2013 mimic those of menopause, and primary care doctors don\u2019t routinely check women\u2019s blood for high levels of PTH.</p> <p>I redoubled my efforts to find an endocrinologist who could see me sooner and once again failed. But then I came down with another UTI \u2013 an annoyingly common event, thanks to genitourinary syndrome of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/17/millions-of-women-are-suffering-who-dont-have-to-why-its-time-to-end-the-misery-of-utis\">menopause</a>, though I have far fewer now thanks to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8058921/\">vaginal estrogen</a> \u2013 and my urologist just happened to know a young endocrinologist who was taking on new patients. A breakthrough!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/article/2024/jul/08/middle-age-knees-injury\">First my left knee, then my right: my middle-aged body\u2019s betrayal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The endocrinologist confirmed my hyperparathyroidism diagnosis. So she ordered more scans and tests and asked me to seek out a parathyroid surgeon or two to see if I had an adenoma \u2013 a non-cancerous growth on the parathyroid gland and the hallmark of primary hyperparathyroidism \u2013 which would then need to be removed.</p> <p>I consulted with two surgeons, neither of whom found an adenoma on a scan, so I didn\u2019t need surgery. Instead, they concluded that I had secondary hyperparathyroidism, brought on by a lack of vitamin D.</p> <p>Getting to the bottom of my osteoporosis was quickly becoming a full-time job. Never mind all the visits themselves \u2013 even finding the right doctors, who were in-network, could take hours upon hours of research. At this point, I\u2019d either seen in person or interviewed 10 doctors in total.</p> <p>***</p> <p>OK, great, I thought. I know <em>why</em> I have osteoporosis at 57. Now what do I do about it?</p> <p>Luckily, I was already on track. In 2022, I\u2019d started taking estrogen, which the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10009319/\">British Menopause Society</a> calls \u201cthe treatment of choice for osteoporosis prevention\u201d. The North American Menopause Society\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://menopause.org/wp-content/uploads/professional/nams-2022-hormone-therapy-position-statement.pdf\">2022 position paper</a> on hormone therapy also states that estrogen prevents bone loss and reduces fracture risk.</p> <p>In an ideal world, I\u2019d have been prescribed estrogen the minute I had my uterus removed in 2012 for another medical issue. But back then, HRT was not the standard of care for any woman, with or without a uterus, as it was still being <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37847875/\">falsely demonized</a> as causing breast cancer. Could the 10-year gap between my hysterectomy and commencement of hormone therapy have contributed to my osteoporosis? According to a number of doctors I consulted, quite possibly, yes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical industry offers no shortage of drugs for people with osteoporosis \u2013 as doctors, friends and relatives readily reminded me \u2013 but the deeper I dug into each one, the less I was sure I wanted any of them. Bisphosphonates like Fosomax, often the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2667901/\">first drug of choice</a> following an osteoporosis diagnosis, inhibit bone resorption and increase bone mass density. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10009319/pdf/10.1177_20533691221139902.pdf\">But there isn\u2019t much data</a> on <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10009319/pdf/10.1177_20533691221139902.pdf\">long-term use in younger patients like me</a>. Plus, in rare instances, they have been shown to <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24753-bisphosphonates\">cause</a> osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femur fractures \u2013 exactly the injury I was trying to avoid.</p> <p>Prolia injections target a specific molecule that bone-removing cells need in order to work, but they also make one more susceptible to infections. With my recurring UTIs and concomitant antibiotic resistance, this, too, was a no-go. Also, once you start with Prolia, you have to keep taking it twice a year, and the <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-prolia-cost#next-steps\">cost</a>, depending on one\u2019s insurance and eligibility for <a href=\"https://www.evenityproliahcp.com/access-and-support/prolia-copay-program\">coupons</a>, can be prohibitive. Forteo, an anabolic that is a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone, stimulates the formation of new bone and also boosts bone mineral density, but is contraindicated for people with hypercalcemic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism. Moreover, one of its side effects is dizziness, and I\u2019m a lifelong fainter with low blood pressure and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/orthostatic-hypotension/symptoms-causes/syc-20352548\">orthostatic hypotension</a> \u2013 so probably not a great idea if I wanted to avoid falling and breaking more bones.</p> <p>I told my endocrinologist I needed to think about all of this. In the meantime, I asked her to check my PTH levels again. Lo and behold, Dr O\u2019Connor\u2019s vitamin D3 regimen had worked! My PTH levels are now in the normal range, and my hyperparathyroidism is gone.</p> <p>What effect did this have on my skeleton? My endocrinologist thought it would be worthwhile to repeat the Dexa scan at the same office where I got the first one. Alas, their next appointment isn\u2019t until four months from now \u2013 a full 18 months after my first scan. In New York City, getting the healthcare I need should be easy. It is not.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t take anything?\u201d I said to my endocrinologist. \u201cWhat are my risks if I continue lifting weights to build strength and muscle, taking vitamin D and estrogen, eating calcium rich foods and exercising daily?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/mar/01/how-menopause-changes-brain-body\">Three things to know about your brain in menopause \u2013 and how to navigate the changes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether to take drugs, she said, was ultimately my choice, but my osteoporosis was serious. \u201cEven a sneeze,\u201d she said, \u201ccan break your spine.\u201d</p> <p>Great, I thought. I\u2019ll try to avoid sneezing.</p> <p>Utterly confused, I spoke with oncologist Dr Avrum Bluming, co-author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4et7sNA\">Estrogen Matters</a>. He calls osteoporosis a disease of decreased bone resilience: the ability of bone to stretch without breaking. Drugs like Fosomax and Prolia treat bone density, he said, but not bone resilience.</p> <p>Here, again, estrogen was key. \u201cBone mineral density is not a great test for osteoporosis, which is a lack of bone <em>elasticity</em>,\u201d he said. Bone mineral density \u201cdoes not correlate very well with risk of fracture. What we do know is estrogen does prolong the ability of bone collagen fibers to remain flexible or elastic, and it decreases the risk of serious fracture, especially hip fracture, by up to 50%.\u201d</p> <p>I still wasn\u2019t sure what to do about treatment or where to turn to find out. Should I try to find a different endocrinologist? I called my daughter, who\u2019s in her fourth year of med school, but she had no new insights from her studies.</p> <p>Then, this summer, I read a revelatory <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07634-3\">new study in Nature</a> co-authored by Dr Muriel Babey, an endocrinologist and researcher at UCSF. Its headline immediately caught my eye: \u201cA maternal brain hormone that builds bone.\u201d In the study, Babey and her colleagues finally answer the question that has been puzzling endocrinologists for over a century: how do the bones of breastfeeding women stay strong and resilient when they are losing so much calcium to milk production? In theory, a lactating mother should have severely osteoporotic bones. (In rare instances, called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10404404/\">pregnancy and lactation-associated osteoporosis</a> (PLO), they do.)</p> <p>The answer lies in a newly discovered hormone: CCN3, the so-called Maternal Brain Hormone, which the researchers found almost by accident by studying the hormones of female mice, a rare occurrence as male mice are the norm for most animal studies.</p> <p>When Babey\u2019s team gave CCN3 to female mice who were very old or lacking in estrogen, it doubled the mice\u2019s bone mass and, critically, their bones were more resilient and broke less easily. CCN3 has not yet been tested in humans, but if it works on women the way it works in female mice, Maternal Brain Hormone could be <em>the</em> missing magic bullet in terms of osteoporosis treatment.</p> <p>I contacted Babey to ask if and when the hormone might come to market. \u201cFor pharmaceutical application,\u201d she said, \u201cthe timeline is usually around five to 10 years\u201d. Too late for me, alas, but it does give me hope that my daughter might have better options if she is diagnosed.</p> <p>I gave Babey a brief history of my osteoporosis journey and the various treatments I\u2019d considered. \u201cWhat if I do nothing?\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cI would definitely get another baseline first before even deciding if anabolic treatment will be necessary,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "On 16 June 2023, I got my first Dexa scan. I was 57. Three hours later, a rogue driver plowed his car into mine and shattered my wrist in three places. Fifty-seven is relatively young for a Dexa \u2013 or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry \u2013 scan, which measures bone density, or the amount of calcium and minerals in your bones. The CDC recommends them for women 65 and over, but while interviewing Joanna Strober, CEO of Midi Health, a virtual care clinic for those in perimenopause and menopause, she had urged me to get one sooner. Strober had become alarmed by how many of their fiftysomething patients were finding that they had the bones of an octogenarian. The results of my Dexa scan arrived in my inbox a week after my car crash: I had full-blown osteoporosis. I was still recovering from multiple injuries, so the diagnosis took a back seat. I was also under the impression \u2013 because of my age, ignorance and the invisible, pain-free pathogenesis of osteoporosis \u2013 that loss of bone mass was less of an immediate threat to my health and wellbeing than my visible injuries. But, in fact, my osteoporosis had made me more susceptible to that broken wrist. Without intervention, osteoporotic bones simply deteriorate and grow increasingly more brittle with age. They also take longer to heal from fractures. I can attest to that: 15 months later, it still hurts to hold a pitcher of water. Osteoporosis comes from osteo (from ost\u00e9on, Greek for bone) and poros (Greek for pore or passage). It describes just that: a hollowing out and reduction of bone mass such that the tiny holes that naturally occur in our bones widen into a gaping, irregular lattice. Osteoporosis occurs predominantly in postmenopausal women. A woman in her 50s has a 14% chance of having it. By age 80, she has a 70% chance. It begins when the creation of new bone can no longer keep up with the loss of old bone. These hollowed-out bones are far more prone to breakage, particularly in the hip, spine and, yes, wrist. The survival rate for women, following a hip fracture, is worse than most cancers: half will be dead in five years. Yes, men get osteoporosis, too, but the percentages are much lower. A crude estimate for men over 50 is 4.2%, and authorities don\u2019t recommend routine bone density testing, either for men or for women my age. But if I\u2019ve learned anything over the course of my work reporting on women\u2019s health, it\u2019s that most of what we\u2019ve been told often turns out to be wrong, and none of it has been sufficiently studied, if at all. Unsurprisingly, trying to figure out how to treat my osteoporosis has only confirmed this. *** I had several risk factors for osteoporosis: small body frame (5ft 2in, thin), family history (including a great aunt who died from a broken hip), ethnicity (white; Asians are also more prone) and a prior history of fractures. So my primary care provider had agreed it couldn\u2019t hurt to get a Dexa scan at 57 as a baseline. At my annual physical, my vitamin D levels were below normal \u2013 another red flag. My gynecologist also thought it a good idea and ordered the scan, which took three months to schedule. The resulting diagnosis of full-blown osteoporosis shocked me. I\u2019m an active woman in good shape for my age. I don\u2019t smoke or drink. I eat a balanced diet. I do yoga twice weekly, ride my bike and walk 10,000 steps every day. Yet my Dexa results were similar to those of an 80-year-old woman. Dexa scan results include T-score numbers, which indicate how many standard deviation units below the mean the subject\u2019s bones have deteriorated in three key places for breakage: lumbar spine, femoral neck and hip. The mean is 0, for a healthy young person with strong bones. Any score between -1 and 0 is considered healthy. Scores from -1 to -2.5 point to osteopenia, which is less a clinical diagnosis and more an indication that bone mass loss has begun. Any score below -2.5 indicates osteoporosis. My hip T-score was -2, but my lumbar spine T-score was -3.2; my left femoral neck was -2.7. \u201cThe patient has Osteoporosis lumbar spine, left femoral neck,\u201d the radiologist wrote in my report. \u201cPatient fracture risk is elevated.\u201d After recovering from the crash, I set out in search of answers. But even I, a woman who writes about women\u2019s health, had no idea which specialist to contact. An orthopedist? A rheumatologist? An endocrinologist? A gerontologist? Some combination of all four? The consensus among friends, family and Google was to seek out an endocrinologist. Endocrinologists treat diseases of hormonal imbalance. Osteoporosis, I was surprised to learn, is a hormone-related disease \u2013 a drop in estrogen or an overactive thyroid, parathyroid or adrenal gland can all weaken bones. But the sole endocrinologist in network for my insurance who was taking new patients did not have an appointment for another six months. While I waited, I scheduled a Zoom with Dr Mary O\u2019Connor, an orthopedic surgeon I\u2019d previously interviewed for the launch of her book, Taking Care of You: The Empowered Woman\u2019s Guide to Better Health. At her urging, I added a daily 2000 IU Vitamin D3 supplement and upped my intake of calcium-rich foods. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have adequate vitamin D3,\u201d she explained, \u201cyou cannot absorb the calcium that you eat.\u201d She also suggested lifting weights, so I bought some dumbbells and found a 30-minute online workout I actually liked. While researching specialists, I noticed that many rheumatologists included osteoporosis as an area of expertise. They mostly treat connective tissue disorders, but I figured they could at least do the bloodwork I needed. Dr Lauren Wong, a rheumatologist from NYU Langone, one of those rare physicians who treats you as an equal, ordered a ton of that bloodwork. At my follow-up, she had some answers. \u201cYou have hyperparathyroidism,\u201d she told me: my PTH, or parathyroid hormone, levels had come back unnaturally high. Parathyroid hormone, she explained, regulates our calcium levels, and too much parathyroid hormone can contribute to osteoporosis by triggering the release of calcium from bone stores. Wong agreed I needed to see an endocrinologist and possibly a parathyroid surgeon after that. \u201cHyperpara \u2026 what?\u201d I\u2019d never heard of this hard-to-pronounce disease. My endocrinology appointment was still several months away \u2013 God bless America \u2013 so I sought the advice of Dr Babak Larian, a parathyroid surgeon in LA with an excellent YouTube channel about hyperparathyroidism. Over Zoom, Larian told me he thought it was absolutely ridiculous that women in this country are advised to get Dexa scans at 65, given that menopause begins in our late 40s or early 50s. \u201cI think 50 should be the standard,\u201d he said. Larian also explained that we have extremely poor statistics on the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism in the US. \u201cWe\u2019re so far off the mark,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I don\u2019t even know where to start the conversation.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cbecause this is a disease mainly of women, they are [often] not diagnosed\u201d. The Endocrine Society states that the incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in the US is somewhere between 0.1% and 0.7%; women and African Americans are more prone to it. However, a recent retroactive survey in Canada found that 5% of Canada\u2019s population have some form of hyperparathyroidism. Larian believes hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by menopause, and thus that more than 5% of menopausal women have it. But they are completely unaware of this because its symptoms \u2013 such as fatigue, muscle weakness, depression, memory problems \u2013 mimic those of menopause, and primary care doctors don\u2019t routinely check women\u2019s blood for high levels of PTH. I redoubled my efforts to find an endocrinologist who could see me sooner and once again failed. But then I came down with another UTI \u2013 an annoyingly common event, thanks to genitourinary syndrome of menopause, though I have far fewer now thanks to vaginal estrogen \u2013 and my urologist just happened to know a young endocrinologist who was taking on new patients. A breakthrough! The endocrinologist confirmed my hyperparathyroidism diagnosis. So she ordered more scans and tests and asked me to seek out a parathyroid surgeon or two to see if I had an adenoma \u2013 a non-cancerous growth on the parathyroid gland and the hallmark of primary hyperparathyroidism \u2013 which would then need to be removed. I consulted with two surgeons, neither of whom found an adenoma on a scan, so I didn\u2019t need surgery. Instead, they concluded that I had secondary hyperparathyroidism, brought on by a lack of vitamin D. Getting to the bottom of my osteoporosis was quickly becoming a full-time job. Never mind all the visits themselves \u2013 even finding the right doctors, who were in-network, could take hours upon hours of research. At this point, I\u2019d either seen in person or interviewed 10 doctors in total. *** OK, great, I thought. I know why I have osteoporosis at 57. Now what do I do about it? Luckily, I was already on track. In 2022, I\u2019d started taking estrogen, which the British Menopause Society calls \u201cthe treatment of choice for osteoporosis prevention\u201d. The North American Menopause Society\u2019s recent 2022 position paper on hormone therapy also states that estrogen prevents bone loss and reduces fracture risk. In an ideal world, I\u2019d have been prescribed estrogen the minute I had my uterus removed in 2012 for another medical issue. But back then, HRT was not the standard of care for any woman, with or without a uterus, as it was still being falsely demonized as causing breast cancer. Could the 10-year gap between my hysterectomy and commencement of hormone therapy have contributed to my osteoporosis? According to a number of doctors I consulted, quite possibly, yes. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical industry offers no shortage of drugs for people with osteoporosis \u2013 as doctors, friends and relatives readily reminded me \u2013 but the deeper I dug into each one, the less I was sure I wanted any of them. Bisphosphonates like Fosomax, often the first drug of choice following an osteoporosis diagnosis, inhibit bone resorption and increase bone mass density. But there isn\u2019t much data on long-term use in younger patients like me. Plus, in rare instances, they have been shown to cause osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femur fractures \u2013 exactly the injury I was trying to avoid. Prolia injections target a specific molecule that bone-removing cells need in order to work, but they also make one more susceptible to infections. With my recurring UTIs and concomitant antibiotic resistance, this, too, was a no-go. Also, once you start with Prolia, you have to keep taking it twice a year, and the cost, depending on one\u2019s insurance and eligibility for coupons, can be prohibitive. Forteo, an anabolic that is a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone, stimulates the formation of new bone and also boosts bone mineral density, but is contraindicated for people with hypercalcemic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism. Moreover, one of its side effects is dizziness, and I\u2019m a lifelong fainter with low blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension \u2013 so probably not a great idea if I wanted to avoid falling and breaking more bones. I told my endocrinologist I needed to think about all of this. In the meantime, I asked her to check my PTH levels again. Lo and behold, Dr O\u2019Connor\u2019s vitamin D3 regimen had worked! My PTH levels are now in the normal range, and my hyperparathyroidism is gone. What effect did this have on my skeleton? My endocrinologist thought it would be worthwhile to repeat the Dexa scan at the same office where I got the first one. Alas, their next appointment isn\u2019t until four months from now \u2013 a full 18 months after my first scan. In New York City, getting the healthcare I need should be easy. It is not. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t take anything?\u201d I said to my endocrinologist. \u201cWhat are my risks if I continue lifting weights to build strength and muscle, taking vitamin D and estrogen, eating calcium rich foods and exercising daily?\u201d Whether to take drugs, she said, was ultimately my choice, but my osteoporosis was serious. \u201cEven a sneeze,\u201d she said, \u201ccan break your spine.\u201d Great, I thought. I\u2019ll try to avoid sneezing. Utterly confused, I spoke with oncologist Dr Avrum Bluming, co-author of Estrogen Matters. He calls osteoporosis a disease of decreased bone resilience: the ability of bone to stretch without breaking. Drugs like Fosomax and Prolia treat bone density, he said, but not bone resilience. Here, again, estrogen was key. \u201cBone mineral density is not a great test for osteoporosis, which is a lack of bone elasticity,\u201d he said. Bone mineral density \u201cdoes not correlate very well with risk of fracture. What we do know is estrogen does prolong the ability of bone collagen fibers to remain flexible or elastic, and it decreases the risk of serious fracture, especially hip fracture, by up to 50%.\u201d I still wasn\u2019t sure what to do about treatment or where to turn to find out. Should I try to find a different endocrinologist? I called my daughter, who\u2019s in her fourth year of med school, but she had no new insights from her studies. Then, this summer, I read a revelatory new study in Nature co-authored by Dr Muriel Babey, an endocrinologist and researcher at UCSF. Its headline immediately caught my eye: \u201cA maternal brain hormone that builds bone.\u201d In the study, Babey and her colleagues finally answer the question that has been puzzling endocrinologists for over a century: how do the bones of breastfeeding women stay strong and resilient when they are losing so much calcium to milk production? In theory, a lactating mother should have severely osteoporotic bones. (In rare instances, called pregnancy and lactation-associated osteoporosis (PLO), they do.) The answer lies in a newly discovered hormone: CCN3, the so-called Maternal Brain Hormone, which the researchers found almost by accident by studying the hormones of female mice, a rare occurrence as male mice are the norm for most animal studies. When Babey\u2019s team gave CCN3 to female mice who were very old or lacking in estrogen, it doubled the mice\u2019s bone mass and, critically, their bones were more resilient and broke less easily. CCN3 has not yet been tested in humans, but if it works on women the way it works in female mice, Maternal Brain Hormone could be the missing magic bullet in terms of osteoporosis treatment. I contacted Babey to ask if and when the hormone might come to market. \u201cFor pharmaceutical application,\u201d she said, \u201cthe timeline is usually around five to 10 years\u201d. Too late for me, alas, but it does give me hope that my daughter might have better options if she is diagnosed. I gave Babey a brief history of my osteoporosis journey and the various treatments I\u2019d considered. \u201cWhat if I do nothing?\u201d I said. \u201cI would definitely get another baseline first before even deciding if anabolic treatment will be necessary,\u201d she said. She also suggested I get a mini-trampoline to build balance and strength, and to try exercise programs designed for people with osteoporosis. There is extremely limited data, she stressed, on the benefits of so-called rebound exercise, but one study did show an increase in bone mass in premenopausal women. Reader, I bought a mini-trampoline. It can\u2019t hurt. Meanwhile, I\u2019m still taking estrogen and incessantly calling my radiologist\u2019s office to get an earlier appointment. Until then, I will hold off on drugs, and I will try not to sneeze or get in any more car accidents. \u201cJust don\u2019t fall!\u201d an older friend recently advised me with a shrug and a smile, when I asked how she manages her osteoporosis. As I made my way through the large stack of medical bills on my desk from this 15-month odyssey, wondering which to pay now and which to try to push off until later, this seemed as good as advice as any.

      "bodyText": "A leading Uyghur activist has accused the Labour government of \u201cfalling behind\u201d its allies in failing to stand up to China, after ministers backtracked on plans to push for formal recognition of the country\u2019s treatment of the minority group as genocide. Speaking after David Lammy\u2019s first visit to China as UK foreign secretary, the human rights activist Rahima Mahmut, who has lived in exile in the UK since 2000, said she had hoped there would be a shift in UK policy once the party came into power, including following the US in declaring a continuing genocide in Xinjiang. \u201cThe Conservative governments all those years [had] big words but very little action,\u201d said Mahmut, who is the UK director of the World Uyghur Congress. She has long campaigned against the crackdown on Uyghurs, which several governments and human rights bodies have described as a genocide. \u201cBut, sadly, after Labour came into power I didn\u2019t even hear big words,\u201d she added. \u201cI am very, very disappointed, the community is very disappointed.\u201d Since 2017, China has swept an estimated 1 million Uyghurs and other minority groups into internment camps, which it called training centres. Hundreds of thousands are believed to still be incarcerated, and in many cases families have no idea about the fate of relatives who had been detained. Lammy held high-level meetings in Beijing and Shanghai last week during his first visit to China as foreign secretary, as ministers seek to improve engagement and build closer economic ties. Before the visit, the foreign secretary was under pressure to take a tough line with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on a range of human rights issues. A statement after the meeting said Lammy discussed the mistreatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, in China\u2019s far west. In opposition, Labour backed a Commons motion that declared China\u2019s conduct genocide and urged the government to seek formal recognition of this through the UN. But a government source told the Guardian last week that \u201cgenocide is a determination for competent international courts to decide\u201d. Mahmut, who has been unable to return to her homeland, speak to family members and whose brother was held in a camp for two years, said the government needed to take action. She called on the UK to follow the US in labelling China\u2019s actions as genocide and stopping the import of goods made through forced labour in the region. In 2021, an independent and unofficial tribunal led by Sir Geoffrey Nice KC said Uyghurs had been subjected to genocide by China, while the UN concluded the following year that China\u2019s actions could constitute crimes against humanity. Last week, the European parliament passed an emergency resolution censuring China\u2019s repression of the Uyghurs and calling for the release of detainees. \u201cAt the moment [the] UK is falling behind,\u201d said Mahmut. Lammy\u2019s visit comes days after the UK housing secretary took control over a stalled planning decision for a new Chinese embassy in central London that was initially rejected. Beijing bought the Royal Mint Court site for a new embassy in 2018 for \u00a3255m, but has so far failed to gain planning permission. In 2022, Tower Hamlets council voted unanimously to reject a proposed development to move the existing Chinese embassy to a site opposite the Tower of London on security grounds, adding that the planned size of the embassy was inappropriate for the area. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government wrote to Tower Hamlets council on Monday announcing that Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, was calling in the applications rather than letting the local authority decide. The letter also says Rayner will hold a local inquiry into the matter, in line with government policy. Mahmut, who has campaigned against the proposed embassy site alongside local residents and those in exile in Hong Kong, over surveillance concerns, said she was uncertain about what course of action the government would take. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to predict,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we will fight until the end.\u201d Simon Cheng, the founder of Hongkongers in Britain and a former Hong Kong consulate worker who sought asylum in the UK, also felt uncertain about the government\u2019s intervention, particularly as it seeks to improve economic ties with China. Trade between the two countries is worth \u00a3110bn a year. \u201cIt\u2019s still a bit uncertain, it\u2019s good to know the central government has stepped in,\u201d said Cheng. \u201cI\u2019m just a little bit unsure about what this really means \u2013 either they plan to hold the application \u2026 or they might plan to approve it.\u201d In 2022, China\u2019s consul general in Manchester and five other diplomats returned to China after a pro-Hong Kong democracy demonstrator was beaten up outside the consulate. Fearing for their safety at the time, Hong Kong migrants who fled repression by China called on the then Conservative government to take a bolder stance. \u201cThe exiled community members have very legit concerns about this, and if the UK government approves this project it would give a very wrong and damaging message to Beijing,\u201d said Cheng, who fears the new embassy could result in increased surveillance. \u201cWe need to urge the new government to stand tough.\u201d The housing ministry said a decision would be made in due course. The Foreign Office has been approached for comment.",

To be sure, its flagship World Economic Outlook (WEO) report shows the global economy stuck in a relatively low-growth pattern. But given how things stood two years ago, when inflation was at its highest for four decades and Russian troops had just invaded Ukraine, it could have been a lot worse. As the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, rightly pointed out, the fight against high inflation is all but over, and the battle has been won without triggering the deep recession some feared when energy prices were soaring in 2022. While that\u2019s clearly good news, the IMF is aware that there are more downside than upside risks to its forecasts that global growth will be 3.2% in 2024 and 2025. Three main threats are identified. First, there\u2019s a risk that central banks will be too slow in reducing borrowing costs, leading to slower growth and a reassessment by financial markets of their Goldilocks scenario for the global economy. Markets have bought heavily into the idea that central banks will get policy just right, engineering a return of inflation to targets without a recession. That may be true in the US, it looks less clearcut for the eurozone. The second risk is that the war in the Middle East escalates and leads to a sharp increase in oil prices. So far, commodity markets have been relaxed about the heightened tension because they see no immediate danger of crude supplies being cut off, but that could rapidly change. Gourinchas said: \u201cAn escalation in regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, could pose serious risks for commodity markets.\u201d It is a warning worth heeding.

As far as the IMF is concerned, imposing trade barriers and subsidising domestic industry provides a sugar rush but the measures often lead to retaliation and fail to improve living standards in the longer term. Trump is unlikely to take any notice of the IMF\u2019s concerns and has floated the idea of 20% tariffs on all imports into the US and a 60% levy on Chinese goods.

      "bodyText": "Pink cocaine, a drug cocktail that can contain ketamine, ecstasy, meth and crack, has gained notoriety as a party drug. With some media reports citing former One Direction singer Liam Payne had pink cocaine in his system when he fell to his death, there are growing calls for greater awareness of the danger it poses to users. What is pink cocaine? Pink cocaine is a cocktail of drugs that usually does not include cocaine. The mixture, which owes its colour to the addition of food dye and sometimes strawberry flavouring, usually contains at least one stimulant drug and one depressant. The drugs most commonly found in pink cocaine include methamphetamine; ketamine, a dissociative anaesthetic with hallucinogenic effects; and MDMA (ecstasy), as well as benzodiazepines, crack and caffeine. Pink cocaine is usually either taken as a pill form or snorted as a powder. It is rarely injected. It is most commonly used on the club scene. What other names does it have? The drug cocktail\u2019s other street names include tusi or tuci, cocaina rosada, tucibi, pink powder, Eros and Venus. Tusi was named after the psychedelic compound 2-CB, which was first synthesised by Alexander Shulgin, the so-called godfather of ecstasy. However, 2-CB, is now rarely found in pink cocaine, according to law enforcement officials. Why is pink cocaine in the news? According to some news reports, former One Direction singer Liam Payne had pink cocaine in his system when he fell to his death from a hotel balcony in Argentina last week. ABC News and TMZ both reported that the drug cocktail had been found during a partial autopsy, citing anonymous sources familiar with the preliminary tests. What does pink cocaine do? People use the drug on the club scene to experience euphoria and enhanced sensory perception. UK Addiction Treatment Centres said it could cause \u201challucinations\u201d. On its website, it states: \u201cPink cocaine also has hallucinogenic properties, unlike the purely stimulant effects of traditional cocaine. Users of pink cocaine report both euphoric and psychedelic experiences, including altered sensory perception and mood swings. \u201cWhen compared to other stimulants like methamphetamine or synthetic drugs like ecstasy (MDMA), pink cocaine offers a unique combination of stimulant and hallucinogenic effects.\u201d It is an easy drug to overdose on, the treatment centres added. Long-term use can also cause heart attacks, high blood pressure, increased risk of stroke, as well as behavioural changes, addiction, persistent anxiety, depression and psychosis. What are the origins of pink cocaine? The drug first appeared on Colombia\u2019s streets in about 2010, and its use has since spread though the Latin American club scene, including in Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Chile and Panama, according to Vice. It has also gained popularity among clubbers in the US and in Europe, particularly in Spain. According to a UN drugs report published in 2022, pink cocaine has been found in the UK, Austria, Switzerland, Canada and south-east Asia.",

Across the country, schools, parks and public buildings have been marked with thousands of memorial plaques in what is framed as the ultimate sacrifice for the homeland. The Russian president has also tried to couple the conflict to the second world war, galvanising nationalist sentiments and framing the military actions as a continuation of historical struggles. Some observers interpret Russia\u2019s subdued reaction to mass casualties as rooted in a longstanding tradition, further reinforced under Putin\u2019s leadership, where the value of individual life is diminished. This perspective draws on historical reference points, including the many who perished during the second world war, the mass purges under Stalin, and most recently the Covid death toll, believed to be one of the highest in the world. \u201cUnder Putin, the value of life has further diminished, while he simultaneously cultivated a cult of death,\u201d said Dina Khapaeva, a Russian professor at Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, who focuses her research on historical memory.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s ground game in Arizona and Nevada may be undermined by canvassers working for America Pac using GPS spoofing to pretend they have knocked on doors when they haven\u2019t, according to multiple people familiar with the practice and a leaked how-to-fake-location video. The ramifications for Trump may be far reaching, given America Pac has taken on the bulk of the Trump campaign\u2019s ground game in the battleground states, and the election increasingly appears set to be decided by turnout. A bootleg how-to-spoof video, made by an America Pac canvasser in Nevada and obtained by the Guardian, shows the apparent ease with which locations can be changed to fake door knocks, calling into question how many Trump voters have actually been reached by the field operation. The video, shared with a few hundred canvassers, walks through the setup: a user downloads a GPS-spoofing app to falsely place themself at the door of a Trump voter, fakes responses to the survey and takes steps to cover up the fraud by varying the survey responses to make it believable. The scope of the GPS-spoofing practice is unclear because it is difficult to catch cheaters without cross-referencing data with another tracker. It is also not a problem limited to America Pac; GPS spoofing has been a problem for years and it has become increasingly resource-intensive to catch cheaters. In response to the reporting, America Pac issued to a joint statement by its vendors Blitz, Patriot Grassroots, Echo Canyon and the Synapse Group. \u201cEvery door that is marked leaves unique fingerprints, and the fingerprints of a door marked with a spoofing app leave these fingerprints in neon colors. We have tech-enabled auditing and fraud prevention tools to identify and dismiss the bad apples, the Pac doesn\u2019t pay a dime, and the door gets knocked by the next canvasser,\u201d it said. Blitz \u2013 the vendor in Arizona and Nevada \u2013 has its canvassers clock in and clock out using the QuickBooks Workforce app, which continually tracks locations and has some geofence features, according to two people directly familiar with the situation. But the geolocation data stored on the Workforce app can be manipulated by turning off location services \u2013 and one former Blitz auditor said they would typically only review the secondary location data if something first appeared amiss on the canvassing app Campaign Sidekick itself. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts The video comes as America Pac has struggled to grapple with 24% of the door knocks in Arizona and 25% of the door knocks done in Nevada last week \u2013 by less sophisticated cheaters working for Blitz \u2013 being flagged internally as potentially faked or fraudulent, according to data obtained by the Guardian. Faking surveys In the how-to-spoof video, the canvasser opens up a door-knocking route for America Pac in Nevada \u2013 apparently for the benefit of his colleagues \u2013 and explains the method he uses to change his location so that it appears as though he is visiting every house he is supposed to. The canvasser first pulls up the location changer app and zooms in so that the map there mirrors the map on the Campaign Sidekick app that shows the houses supposed to be knocked with orange dots. He then memorizes the position of the target Trump voter\u2019s house on the Campaign Sidekick app, navigates back to the location changer app, and taps the same house to spoof his location as supposedly being in the driveway. \u201cThese houses down here look the same way on the app, so you know, you just move that shit over there \u2013 or you can type the address in but this is way faster \u2013 so I just change my location right there,\u201d the canvasser explains. The canvasser then explains how to falsify survey responses so that the activity does not appear suspicious and invite an internal audit of the doors that could result in firing or being referred by the canvassing company for prosecution. \u201cSo here\u2019s the part that matters: you click the house, you want to do \u2018not home\u2019 for about five houses so you click the \u2018not home\u2019 shit, \u2018left literature\u2019, boom, and then you want to put a survey in,\u201d the canvasser says. \u201cSo this is the survey. You click available for survey. This is what I do. I click \u2018definitely yes\u2019, \u2018Donald Trump\u2019, \u2018early vote\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018end survey\u2019. So it\u2019s pretty much that simple. So then you keep bouncing between houses. And you don\u2019t want to go too fast, you want to make it look realistic.\u201d After this story was published, an America Pac official said their review of the video showed it was made by a canvasser working for the September Group, which lost the contract for Arizona and Nevada in mid-September. Blitz Canvassing took over the operation days later. The canvasser in question worked for the September Group until he was fired for GPS spoofing. But when Blitz took over, he re-applied and was re-hired to knock doors in Nevada, where he promptly started GPS spoofing once more, according to two people familiar with the matter. The canvasser was fired by Blitz two weeks later. It remains unclear how often Blitz\u2019s auditors are reviewing the roughly 400-450 canvassers. If audits are done every few days \u2013 a person familiar with the matter said it was at least every five days \u2013 and canvassers are together frauding several hundred doors a day, that could quickly add up. The problem of suspicious doors in the America Pac field operation underscores the risk of outsourcing a ground-game program, where paid canvassers are typically not as invested in their candidate\u2019s victory compared with traditional volunteers or campaign staff. Musk has so far donated $75m to America Pac in the three months of its existence. Roughly $30m has been spent on the ground-game operation to drive the Trump vote, with the rest put towards digital and mail advertising for the former president, as well as for down-ballot Republican candidates.",

They have so far identified at least 49 others which they say share similar characteristics to the initial \u201cGerman case\u201d. None of the organisations or individuals under investigation have yet been publicly named. \u201cThe incident that led to the initiation of the case is not isolated,\u201d federal prosecutor Mar\u00eda Alejandra M\u00e1ngano said in a statement. \u201cOn the contrary, it was revealed that it was a business scheme, developed at a national and international level.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 November 2024. An earlier version said that in Britain \u201cintended parents are vetted by social workers\u201d; this should have referred specifically to those intended parents who apply for a parental order.",

      "body": "<p>In the second year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, a young lawyer with crisply shorn blond hair approached the podium at a gathering for Texas members of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-_5bPKuIRg\">Federalist Society</a>, a conservative legal group that wields immense power in the US judicial system. As vice-president of the group\u2019s Fort Worth chapter, Matthew Kacsmaryk had the honor of presenting the first speaker.</p> <p>\u201cWe are blessed to have Judge Edith Jones,\u201d Kacsmaryk announced. Jones, a longtime judge on the US fifth circuit court of appeals, stepped on stage to introduce the evening\u2019s guest, her friend, the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. In her introduction, Jones also hailed the four new conservative judges Trump had appointed to join her on the appeals court.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve raised the bar for the fifth circuit since I got on,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s thanks to the Federalist Society, to Leonard.\u201d</p> <p>Leonard Leo needed no last name in his introduction to this crowd as he took his seat in a black leather chair across from Thomas. The justice was the featured speaker but Leo may have been the most important person in the American legal system in that room \u2013 a conservative activist who had built the Federalist Society into a political powerhouse and helped Trump create the supreme court majority that, in 2022, erased federal protections for abortion.</p> <p>His influence continues to be on display now in one of the most consequential cases moving through the American legal system \u2013 one that seeks to strike another blow to abortion rights and could possibly bankrupt Planned Parenthood, one of the nation\u2019s leading providers of healthcare for women. It\u2019s a lawsuit that has been filed by an anti-abortion activist tied to Leo and heard by judges \u2013 from the lower courts to the fifth circuit appeals court \u2013 who are also linked<strong> </strong>to Leo.</p>    <p>Three of the people on the stage at the Federalist Society event in Fort Worth in 2018 \u2013 Kacsmaryk, Jones and Leo \u2013 have all played key roles in the case. Though the stakes in this case couldn\u2019t be higher for one of the nation\u2019s oldest healthcare providers, it is about more than abortion or healthcare. The lawsuit is a parable about Leo\u2019s power amid a presidential election season whose outcome will probably determine to what extent Leo will continue to reshape the makeup and ideology of the nation\u2019s courts.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>The case was filed in February 2021 by an anti-abortion activist who had conducted what he described as an \u201cextensive undercover investigation\u201d of the organization. He accuses Planned Parenthood of fraud \u2013 claiming that it owes $1.8bn in fines, fees and reimbursements to the Medicaid program. It\u2019s an amount that could force the 108-year-old non-profit healthcare provider to shutter clinics across the country.</p> <p>The lawsuit is titled USA v Planned Parenthood because it was filed under a federal whistleblower law that allows citizens to sue on behalf of the US government over allegations that federal programs have been defrauded. It is the latest in a series of legal actions that started in 2015 after Texas\u2019s health officials used footage from the activist\u2019s hidden-camera recordings as a basis to expel Planned Parenthood from the state\u2019s Medicaid program.</p> <p>The activist and his allies claimed the videos showed Planned Parenthood was illegally selling fetal tissue and endangering pregnant people\u2019s health.</p> <p>Planned Parenthood repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Investigations in multiple states triggered by the video resulted in no disciplinary action against the healthcare provider.</p> <p>The US government \u2013 the source of 90% of the Medicaid funds paid to Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas \u2013 disputes that Planned Parenthood owes the federal government money. Federal officials say in a court filing that they found no evidence that Planned Parenthood had improperly billed for its services and that they found no reason Planned Parenthood should have been removed from Medicaid. Experts in healthcare law expected the case to be dismissed quickly.</p> <p>Yet none of these facts are as important to understanding the significance of this case as knowing where it was filed: in the federal courthouse in Amarillo, Texas \u2013 home to zero Planned Parenthood clinics.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t an accident.</p> <p>The US district court in Amarillo is under the purview of the US fifth circuit court of appeals, making it likely that any upward appeals in Planned Parenthood\u2019s case would be heard in the hard-right appeals court, including by judges appointed by Trump or other conservative stalwarts like Jones. And by the time the Planned Parenthood case was filed, Kacsmaryk \u2013 that young attorney on stage making introductions at the Federalist Society event in Texas \u2013 had been serving as the federal district court judge for Amarillo for nearly two years. Kacsmaryk had been appointed by Trump, who had famously consulted Leo in picking judges for federal appointments.</p>    <p>Kacsmaryk was the only judge in the Amarillo court district, and all but guaranteed to hear the Planned Parenthood case.</p> <p>Hundreds of court files, tax records and judges\u2019 financial disclosure forms reviewed by the Guardian<em> </em>show that Kacsmaryk and most of the other key players in the case to topple Planned Parenthood are tied to Leo via a vast network of non-profit and for-profit organizations involved in the fight against abortion or other conservative causes.</p> <p>Tax records analyzed by the Guardian show that a conservative legal non-profit where Kacsmaryk worked before he was appointed to the bench made at least three payments totaling more than $350,000 to a public relations firm, CRC Advisors, that Leo acquired in early 2020.</p> <p>That conservative legal group, First Liberty Institute, made a payment of $137,000 before Kacsmaryk was confirmed as a judge in mid-2019 and before Leo took over the PR firm, tax records show. The next two payments \u2013 totaling more than $230,000 \u2013 were made after Kacsmaryk was sworn in as a district judge, the records show. At least one of those payments was made after Leo had taken over the PR firm, according to First Liberty\u2019s tax filings for 2020 and 2021.</p> <p>First Liberty\u2019s general counsel Hiram Sasser said his organization has worked with CRC Advisors at least dating back to 2015, long before Leo took over the company. Sasser told the Guardian he had never worked with Leo and that Leo\u2019s business partner, Greg Mueller, was the organization\u2019s point of contact.</p> <p>Records also revealed that First Liberty had <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/751403169/202421149349301027/full\">paid</a> the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys who filed USA v Planned Parenthood, Heather Hacker and Andrew Stephens, more than $500,000 in 2023 in consulting fees. First Liberty\u2019s Sasser said the payment was for the attorneys\u2019 work in another, unrelated case.</p> <p>In other words, Kacsmaryk is ruling in a case in which the attorneys arguing in front of him have received substantial payments from his former employer. First Liberty also employs the spouse of one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.</p> <p>Hacker and Stephens did not respond to multiple attempts to reach them for comment.</p> <p>Some legal ethicists and court watchdog organizations contacted by the Guardian say that this case is another example of the ambiguities of the judiciary\u2019s rules about conflict of interest and recusal rules.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/455\">rules</a> require that a judge \u201cshall disqualify himself in any <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=28-USC-408818804-1019605827&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=\">proceeding</a> in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d. But it is unclear whether any of the connections between First Liberty, Leo and the attorneys on this case meet that threshold.</p> <p>This case \u201craises the shortcomings in the recusal law when the ties that exist in this case seem fairly obviously to impugn and implicate the bias of the judge who\u2019s hearing the case\u201d, said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for increased transparency and accountability within the court system.</p> <p>Kacsmaryk did not respond to a detailed list of questions provided to him through a court spokesperson. Leo did not reply to most questions sent to him by the Guardian but a spokesperson for him said: \u201cMr Leo has not spoken to Matthew Kacsmaryk since a public encounter in 2019.\u201d</p> <p>Records also show that Leo, a lawyer, provided key legal advice to the anti-abortion activist suing Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>Through generous grants he has provided to law schools and legal organizations, Leo has also helped to underwrite luxury trips to judicial conferences for judges on the fifth circuit court of appeals who have ruled on the Planned Parenthood case.</p> <p>When nearly every person on one side of a legal case and the judge are connected politically or ideologically, it is called court capture \u2013 a term some legal scholars use to describe USA v Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>In a captured court, specific judges, lawyers and even plaintiffs align to produce a specific outcome of a case \u2013 often an outcome that supports beliefs or preferences that tie each of these legal actors together.</p> <p>The shared ideology in this case is ending abortion.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a lawsuit that has no merit, but somehow it\u2019s progressing anyway,\u201d said Nicole Huberfeld, the chair of the health law program at Boston University and the co-director of the university\u2019s program on reproductive justice. \u201cIt seems to me an attempt to try to limit the activities of Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas and Louisiana by any means possible.\u201d</p> <p>The presidential election in November will determine who will nominate the next generation of judges to the federal courts: the former president Donald Trump, whose nominees to the supreme court played a key role in overturning Roe v Wade \u2013 or the vice-president, Kamala Harris, who has staked much of her presidential campaign on restoring abortion rights nationwide.</p> <p>There are currently 44 federal <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/future-judicial-vacancies\">judgeships vacant</a>, with another 23 judges announcing their plans to step down from the bench.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>Lena Zwarensteyn, the fair courts campaign director for the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, describes court capture as a \u201cmanufactured and coordinated effort determined to produce specific outcomes\u201d.</p> <p>Those manufactured efforts, she said, are \u201cjeopardizing the health of pregnant people, jeopardizing even access to contraception, jeopardizing the government\u2019s ability to set forth and enforce civil and human rights protection for access to clean air and water\u201d.</p> <p>Zwarensteyn said the right\u2019s focus on the courts was a reaction to major wins by the civil rights movement in the 1960s and early 70s, including victories expanding voting rights.</p> <p>Groups like the Federalist Society \u2013 an organization dedicated to reforming the court \u201cto place a premium on individual liberty, traditional values, and the rule of law\u201d \u2013 created a pipeline of legal talent ready to fill federal judgeships. In 1986, as a young law student at Cornell Law School, Leo founded a chapter of the group. He eventually ascended the ranks of the organization to become co-chair of its board of directors and build a network of conservative lawyers and law students throughout the country who could be candidates for judgeships throughout the federal system.</p> <p>After Trump was elected president in 2016, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/23/leonard-leo-us-judiciary-wisconsin-north-carolina\">leaned</a> on a list of judicial nominees provided by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/23/leonard-leo-us-judiciary-wisconsin-north-carolina\">Leo</a> to fill vacancies, stacking the courts with conservative judges from the district level, to the appellate courts and the supreme court. Trump named <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/apptsbypres.pdf\">245 federal judges</a> to the bench in his one term, compared with 334 over Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office. Trump ultimately appointed six hard-right judges to the fifth circuit appeals court along with appointing 28 judges to district courts in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi that are under the fifth circuit\u2019s umbrella.</p>    <p>The six circuit court appointments helped create an appeals court that is even more Maga than the US supreme court, which itself has been widely condemned for destroying federal protections for abortion rights and other decisions favored by Trump and his supporters. In its most recent term, the supreme court overruled eight of the 11 fifth circuit decisions it took up for consideration \u2013 including reversing rulings by the district judge Kacsmaryk and the fifth circuit appeals court that sought to limit access to mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortions. The fifth circuit\u2019s reversals by the high court were the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/07/how-fifth-circuit-won-losing/678918/\">most for any circuit</a> for the second year in a row.</p> <p>While much public attention is focused on the nominations of supreme court justices and the 100 to 150 cases the high court takes up each year, the workings of the fifth circuit \u2013 and the roughly 5,000 cases it decides each year \u2013 get far less scrutiny.</p> <p>The John Minor Wisdom courthouse in downtown New Orleans where the the fifth circuit is headquartered has become the preferred venue for much of the conservative movement \u2013 so much so that businesses and advocates outside the fifth circuit\u2019s jurisdiction have filed paperwork to incorporate an organization in Texas that only exists on paper or recruited plaintiffs who are tangential to a case but reside within the court\u2019s boundaries.</p> <p>One Trump-appointed district court judge, frustrated by the US chamber of commerce filing a case in Texas by recruiting a Texas bank as a plaintiff even though most of the major players in the suit were in Washington DC, wrote that the \u201cvenue is not a continental breakfast; you cannot pick and choose on a Plaintiff\u2019s whim where and how a lawsuit is filed\u201d.</p> <p>District and appeals court judges in the fifth circuit are well known to big businesses trying to skirt financial and environmental regulations, political operatives looking to dilute the voting power of marginalized communities, anti-immigration advocates looking to undercut asylum law and anti-abortion activists seeking to limit legal access to reproductive care \u2013 as in the case in Amarillo that attempts to force Planned Parenthood to pay out more than $1.8bn.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>The origins of USA v Planned Parenthood trace back to a conservative activist from California named David Daleiden who described his anti-abortion positions as his birthright. In media <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/us/with-planned-parenthood-videos-activist-ignites-abortion-issue.html\">interviews</a> he <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?403139-4/planned-parenthood-videos\">described himself</a> as a \u201cchild of a crisis pregnancy\u201d and said \u201cthere were people who said I should be aborted\u201d.</p> <p>Daleiden formed an anti-abortion group at his high school. In college he co-authored an article about the emotional toll of abortions on physicians performing them.</p> <p>By 2013, when was in his mid-20s, he founded a non-profit called the Center for Medical Progress with the mission of using undercover journalism to \u201cactively oppose the exploitation of any class of human beings, whether born or unborn\u201d, according to its tax filings.</p> <p>In a draft proposal for a hidden-camera investigation of Planned Parenthood, Daleiden crafted a plan for a \u201ccutting edge expos\u00e9 of the commercial exploitation of aborted fetuses\u201d using \u201cgotcha undercover videos\u201d that would show doctors \u201ccannibalizing the young and playing God\u201d.</p> <p>By 2014, he was secretly recording healthcare providers discussing fetal tissue procedures at abortion conferences in California and Maryland.</p>    <p>Though the Center for Medical Progress listed Daleiden as its only employee on its tax forms, he had help from Leo and other conservative activists during his undercover investigation in 2014 and 2015. In an affidavit, Daleiden said he consulted Leo \u201cabout how to ensure successful prosecutions of various entities illegally profiting from the sale of fetal tissue\u201d.</p> <p>To handle public relations for his group, Daleiden hired Leo\u2019s business partner, Mueller, a political consultant and messaging specialist.</p> <p>Daleiden did not reply to multiple emails and phone messages seeking comment for this story.</p> <p>In April 2015, Daleiden talked his way into a tour of a Planned Parenthood office in Houston. He and another activist posed as representatives of a company that specialized in procuring fetal tissue for researchers. Scientists use the tissue to try to develop cures for diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. The advocates surreptitiously recorded their conversations with Melissa Farrell, a Planned Parenthood research coordinator, and a physician with the clinic.</p> <p>Daleiden asked Farrell about how the tissue would be treated and preserved. Farrell gave a rambling, sometimes confusing answer, telling Daleiden the Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast affiliate had extensive experience in working with researchers to meet their needs.</p> <p>At one point, she told Daleiden that in meeting the needs of researchers, there were times when \u201cwe deviate from our standards\u201d.</p> <p>Daleiden saw that phrase and other parts of the recordings as evidence that Planned Parenthood was violating federal laws governing the collection of fetal tissue.</p> <p>Farrell later explained in a sworn statement that she meant clinic procedures \u2013 not medical procedures \u2013 could be altered to minimize disruption at the clinic and \u201cwould never be done in a way that involves suboptimal care for patients\u201d.</p> <p>In July and August 2015, Daleiden shared the videos with state officials in Texas and released them publicly. He went on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzMx4ieyF64\">Fox News</a> to accuse Planned Parenthood of \u201charvesting and selling\u201d baby parts.</p> <p>The officials who received the videos included Ken Paxton, the state attorney general, and <a href=\"https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/results/leadership/bios/bowens.html\">Stuart Bowen</a>, the then inspector general for the state\u2019s health and human services department. Bowen was a longtime Republican operative in Texas who had worked for George W Bush when Bush was governor and later president.</p>    <p>Bowen later testified that he watched the roughly eight hours of video Daleiden provided five times. He determined that Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast did not follow mandatory safety requirements for handling fetal tissue and that the clinic violated medical standards by agreeing to alter the method or timing of an abortion in order to obtain fetal tissue.</p> <p>Federal law prohibits changing the time or manner of an abortion for the purposes of collecting fetal tissue. The idea behind these provisions is to ensure the pregnant person\u2019s wellbeing is prioritized over the researcher\u2019s interest in getting tissue samples.</p> <p>Bowen sought a second opinion from his agency\u2019s chief medical officer \u2013 an orthopedic surgeon who admitted he was not familiar with abortion procedures \u2013 before concluding that the state\u2019s Planned Parenthood clinics were \u201cno longer capable of performing medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical manner\u201d.</p> <p>Bowen\u2019s office sent a letter in October 2015 terminating the Planned Parenthood clinic in Houston, where the video was filmed, from receiving funds though the Texas Medicaid program. The same termination letter also went to Planned Parenthood chapters based in Dallas and San Antonio \u2013 which oversee dozens of clinics across the state that had not been included in the undercover videos and were not involved in fetal tissue donations.</p> <p>Bowen\u2019s decision meant that roughly 11,000 Texas women enrolled in Medicaid would have to seek care somewhere other than Planned Parenthood \u2013 not only for abortions but also for breast cancer screenings, wellness exams and other services provided by the clinics.</p> <p>The clinics with headquarters in Houston, Dallas and San Antonio operate under the Planned Parenthood name and follow marketing, legal and safety requirements set by the national federation, but say they are separate entities, each with its own board of directors and leadership teams.</p> <p>Bowen did not return multiple messages seeking comment.</p> <p>The Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas, with help from lawyers from the national federation, responded to Bowen\u2019s edict by filing a lawsuit in federal court based in Austin. Along with the affiliates, the suit listed 11 Jane Doe patients as plaintiffs. The suit \u2013 Planned Parenthood v Smith \u2013 charged that these Medicaid patients were being denied the right, under federal law, to choose a qualified medical provider.</p> <p>In January 2017, the US district court judge Sam Sparks convened a hearing to determine whether Planned Parenthood should be allowed to remain in the Medicaid program while the case was pending.</p> <p>Sparks, a Republican appointed to the bench in 1991 by George HW Bush, listened to three days of testimony from Bowen, Planned Parenthood employees and other witnesses.</p> <p>In a 42-page opinion, Sparks wrote that the secretly recorded videos and aliases used by the film-makers gave the case the feel of a \u201cbest-selling novel rather than a case involving the interplay of federal and state authority through the Medicaid program. Yet rather than a villain plotting to take over the world, the subject of this case is the State of Texas\u2019s efforts to expel a group of health care providers from a social health care program for families and individuals with limited resources.\u201d</p> <p>He summarized Daleiden\u2019s video as \u201cnothing more than confused and ambiguous dialogue\u201d. The Planned Parenthood employee who commented about deviating from the organization\u2019s standard shifted between talking about administrative and medical processes, making the comments \u201copen to interpretation\u201d, the judge wrote.</p> <p>All that was certain, according to Sparks, was that Bowen and his department did not have \u201ceven a scintilla of evidence\u201d to prove Planned Parenthood had done anything wrong.</p>    <p>Sparks granted Planned Parenthood an injunction that allowed the Texas clinics to continue providing care to Medicaid patients \u2013 at least until the entire case could be heard.</p> <p>Lawyers for the state of Texas did not give Sparks a chance to hold a full hearing of the case.</p> <p>Instead, they pushed the case to a higher authority: the fifth circuit court of appeals.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>In June 2019, about a year after the fifth circuit judge Edith Jones took the microphone to introduce Leo and the supreme court justice Thomas at the Federalist Society event in Fort Worth, she and two other appeals judges took the bench to hear the state of Texas argue that Sparks was wrong in granting Planned Parenthood an injunction.</p> <p>Jones, who had been appointed to the fifth circuit by Ronald Reagan in 1985, had stirred some controversies during her more than three decades on the court. In 2013, attendees at a talk she gave at a Federalist Society event in Pennsylvania alleged she told the crowd that Black and Latino people were more \u201cprone\u201d to commit acts of violence.</p> <p>An investigation led by the future US attorney general Merrick Garland determined there was insufficient evidence to establish whether Jones had violated any rules or substantiate what she had told the crowd.</p> <p>Hacker, who at the time was serving as a lawyer for the state attorney general\u2019s office, told the three judges that Sparks had erred in determining that there wasn\u2019t evidence that Planned Parenthood had ever sold any fetal tissue or broken any laws in obtaining it. He should have looked at the case strictly from an administrative perspective and how the policies and procedures allow the state of Texas to control its Medicaid program, Hacker said.</p> <p>As Planned Parenthood\u2019s attorney, Jennifer Sandman, tried to lay out why Sparks\u2019s ruling was sound, Jones interrupted her with an example that seemed far afield from the dispute over fetal tissue and Medicaid payments.</p> <p>She brought up a Philadelphia doctor convicted of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/15/philadelphia-abortion-doctor-kermit-gosnell-sentenced-life\">first-degree murder </a>for killing three babies born alive by stabbing them with scissors.</p> <p>Using the Philadelphia doctor as an example, Jones asked if a state could ever be allowed to make a judgment to expel a provider.</p> <p>Then she switched gears and described a Planned Parenthood provider on one of the undercover videos who \u201cgiggled\u201d as she discussed procuring fetal tissues.</p> <p>\u201cYour honor, I would deeply disagree with that characterization,\u201d Sandman said.</p> <p>\u201cShe definitely smirked,\u201d Jones shot back.</p> <p>Six months after the hearing, the panel issued its ruling. The decision, written by Jones, acknowledged that Judge Sparks had not found any evidence of wrongdoing by the Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast employees captured on video, but complained that the judge had accepted \u201cself-serving\u201d testimony from Planned Parenthood\u2019s witnesses while \u201crefusing to consider\u201d evidence from Bowen\u2019s office.</p>    <p>The case wasn\u2019t about abortion, she wrote, \u201cdespite being litigated with the trappings of the abortion debate, this is fundamentally a statutory construction case, not an abortion case\u201d. Twenty-six pages earlier in her opinion, she included a screengrab from Daleiden\u2019s video that showed fetal parts \u2013 with a tiny finger and partial limb visible swimming in a clear, glass baking dish.</p> <p>Through a court spokesperson, Jones declined to comment for this story.</p> <p>Jones and the other two judges on the panel voted 3-0 to vacate the injunction that allowed Planned Parenthood to remain in Medicaid. Jones\u2019s opinion also called for the entire fifth circuit \u2013 not just a three-judge panel \u2013 to consider an issue that Texas\u2019s attorney, Hacker, had raised in her argument. Did the women receiving care at Planned Parenthood even have a right to sue over the state\u2019s decision to block the healthcare provider from Medicaid?</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>By 2020, Trump, with help from Leo, has pushed the fifth circuit court of appeals from a conservative court to a far-right bastion. All six of the judges that Trump appointed to the appeals court had claimed membership in Leo\u2019s Federalist Society.</p> <p>One of them, James Ho, wrote on a questionnaire during his confirmation process that he had not missed the group\u2019s annual conference in 20 years and had met his future wife at a gathering of the group.</p> <p>Four of the Trump appointees also accepted trips to legal conferences underwritten by the law school at George Mason University, to which Leo was a regular and generous contributor.</p> <p>Most of the judges appointed to the fifth circuit by Trump also had ties to conservative politics or politicians. Ho served in the George W Bush White House in the Office of Legal Counsel and as solicitor general of Texas, a post in which he fought against same-sex marriage. Stuart Kyle Duncan had also come out of the Texas solicitor general\u2019s office known as a laboratory in which to test ultra conservative legal strategies in cases involving transgender rights, voting rights, and same-sex marriage. Don Willett worked on the 2000 Bush-Cheney presidential campaign and transition team before landing on the Texas state supreme court.</p> <p>All six came to the court with avowed anti-abortion stances.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>Appeals from district court cases to federal circuit courts generally are decided by a three-judge panel selected from the larger pool of appellate judges within the circuit court \u2013 like the panel led by Jones in 2019 that ended Planned Parenthood\u2019s bid to remain in the Medicaid program while the case was pending. But rulings by these three-judge panels can be reviewed by the full contingent of appellate judges in that circuit.</p> <p>In November 2020, four of the Trump-appointed judges were among the 16 fifth circuit jurists who addressed Jones\u2019s request that the full circuit court determine whether Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients had the right to sue in federal court to challenge Texas authorities\u2019 decision to banish the healthcare provider from Medicaid.</p> <p>The lawyers arguing the Medicaid recipients\u2019 claims had a large body of law supporting their position. Six federal circuit courts had previously ruled that Medicaid beneficiaries have a right to sue if they had been denied access to their medical providers \u2013 including a ruling three years earlier by a three-judge panel within the fifth circuit. Only one circuit court had ruled in the other direction.</p> <p>The fifth circuit ruled that the Jane Doe plaintiffs did not have standing to sue in federal court, saying that most other circuits\u2019 reasoning on the issue was \u201cdemonstrably incorrect\u201d. That majority ruling was supported in whole or in part by 14 judges, swamping the two judges who voted against the decision.</p> <p>Planned Parenthood\u2019s appeals to remain in Texas\u2019s Medicaid program were over.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>For Daleiden, the anti-abortion activist, the appeals court ruling was the first victory after a string of defeats in other venues.</p> <p>Investigations inspired by his videos in at least 13 states did not produce actions against Planned Parenthood affiliates in their jurisdictions. Probes by the Texas Rangers and the Harris county district attorney\u2019s office \u2013 whose jurisdiction includes Houston \u2013 also found no wrongdoing by the clinics.</p> <p>Daleiden also suffered repercussions in his home state. In 2016, Kamala Harris, then the California attorney general, sent investigators to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/california-investigators-search-daleidens-home-221604\">raid</a> Daleiden\u2019s home. That probe provided the evidence used by Harris\u2019s successor, Xavier Becerra, to file a 15-count criminal complaint against Daleiden accusing him of illegal eavesdropping and recording people without their consent. His <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/antiabortion-activists-face-criminal-trial-top-17867476.php\">criminal trial </a>is slated for December. Daleiden has pleaded not guilty.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, a federal judge in San Francisco hit Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress with a $2m judgment in a civil case filed by the National Abortion Federation, ruling he had violated the law by secretly recording Planned Parenthood employees and other attendees at conferences organized by the NAF around the country.</p> <p>But as the defeats piled up, two members of the Federalist Society advanced a new strategy that tested the strength of the captured courts Leo had spent over two decades building \u2013 and pushed forward Daleiden\u2019s campaign against Planned Parenthood on a new legal front.</p> <p>Hacker, the attorney who had once represented Texas \u2013 arguing in front of Judge Jones that the Jane Doe patients of Planned Parenthood did not have the standing to sue \u2013 had left the attorney general\u2019s office and entered private practice.</p> <p>She and another former attorney in the attorney general\u2019s office, Stephens, had formed their own private firm. Both were members of the Federalist Society, and have represented organizations that have received funding from Leo\u2019s non-profit network.</p> <p>Through a spokesperson, Leo said he had never met Hacker or Stephens.</p> <p>In 2021, Hacker and Stephens used the US False Claims Act to file a suit in Kacsmaryk\u2019s federal district court in the Texas Panhandle alleging Planned Parenthood owes more than $1.8bn to the government for the payments it received from the time Planned Parenthood clinics were first given notice of their termination in 2015 until the fifth circuit ended Sparks\u2019s injunction in 2020.</p> <p>In court records, the person initiating the case is identified by a pseudonym, Alex Doe. But the details described in the lawsuit and other court documents \u2013 including the undercover video sting \u2013 make it clear that Alex Doe is Daleiden.</p> <p>By filing in Amarillo, the lawyers landed Daleiden\u2019s case in a courtroom presided over by a judge who embraces a family legacy of staunch anti-abortion beliefs \u2013 Kacsmaryk\u2019s mother worked at crisis pregnancy centers that pushed alternatives to abortions, and his wife <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/08/abortion-pill-ruling-judge-matthew-kacsmaryk/\">once posted </a>a photo online of one of their children in a T-shirt that read \u201cI survived Roe v Wade.\u201d</p> <p>Hacker and Stephens\u2019s former boss, Paxton, a member of the Republican Attorneys General Association that receives funding from Leo\u2019s organizations and had appointed Leo to his transition team after taking office, signed on to the lawsuit.</p> <p>Experts interviewed by the Guardian struggled to come up with other examples of when a court ordered an organization to pay back funds it had collected during an injunction.</p> <p>Lawyers for Planned Parenthood have pointed out that the US government has repeatedly asserted in court records that Planned Parenthood should not have been disqualified from the program.</p>    <p>The False Claims Act usually applies when healthcare providers bill for services they did not provide.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just not an appropriate False Claims Act case,\u201d said Dr Abigail R Moncrieff, a professor of health and constitutional law at Cleveland State University. \u201cIf Texas and Louisiana wanted their money back, they should just ask for their money back. But they didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole concept of a whistleblower is that it\u2019s supposed to reveal secret information that the state didn\u2019t know about, and the states here knew about it, and they have not asked for their money back,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Kacsmaryk seems unconvinced. In October 2023 he declined to dismiss the case, writing that Planned Parenthood clinics \u201cwere not entitled to the payments and were obligated to return them at least within 60 days\u201d of their expulsion, he wrote. \u201cNo other argument advanced by Defendants convinces the Court otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Kacsmaryk reached back to a 1919 supreme court decision about injunctions to support his reasoning. That case predated women\u2019s right to vote by nearly a year.</p> <p>The case is on hold in Kacsmaryk\u2019s court as the Planned Parenthood Federation of America \u2013 the administrative headquarters rather than medical providers \u2013 fights Kacsmaryk\u2019s refusal to dismiss the federation from the lawsuit. Since the federation in New York does not provide procedures or bill Medicaid, it should not be subject to Daleiden\u2019s suit, the national group has argued.</p> <p>The appeals court\u2019s decision could come any day. Then the larger questions about whether Planned Parenthood should have to repay Medicaid will resume in Kacsmaryk\u2019s courtroom. If Kacsmaryk finds in Daleiden\u2019s favor, the activist can collect as much as 30% of the fees and fines imposed on Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>On the other side, legal fees keep mounting for the clinics. </p> <p>\u201cEvery dollar, every moment, spent on anything but our mission to provide \u2026 care is a distraction,\u201d said Laura Terrill, Planned Parenthood South Texas\u2019s chief executive officer.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as Planned Parenthood\u2019s fate depends on the courts, the teen birth rate in Texas rose in 2022 for the first time in 15 years. Infant deaths have increased nearly 13%, compared with a 2% jump nationwide. Researchers from the University of Texas found that terminating Planned Parenthood from Medicaid \u201cadversely affected low-income residents\u2019 access to essential reproductive health services, resulting in delayed care and increases in births\u201d, many of which researchers identified as \u201clikely unintended\u201d.</p> <p>Should Planned Parenthood lose the case in Kacsmaryk\u2019s court, it would find itself in familiar territory again: appealing in front of the fifth circuit court.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the second year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, a young lawyer with crisply shorn blond hair approached the podium at a gathering for Texas members of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group that wields immense power in the US judicial system. As vice-president of the group\u2019s Fort Worth chapter, Matthew Kacsmaryk had the honor of presenting the first speaker. \u201cWe are blessed to have Judge Edith Jones,\u201d Kacsmaryk announced. Jones, a longtime judge on the US fifth circuit court of appeals, stepped on stage to introduce the evening\u2019s guest, her friend, the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. In her introduction, Jones also hailed the four new conservative judges Trump had appointed to join her on the appeals court. \u201cThey\u2019ve raised the bar for the fifth circuit since I got on,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s thanks to the Federalist Society, to Leonard.\u201d Leonard Leo needed no last name in his introduction to this crowd as he took his seat in a black leather chair across from Thomas. The justice was the featured speaker but Leo may have been the most important person in the American legal system in that room \u2013 a conservative activist who had built the Federalist Society into a political powerhouse and helped Trump create the supreme court majority that, in 2022, erased federal protections for abortion. His influence continues to be on display now in one of the most consequential cases moving through the American legal system \u2013 one that seeks to strike another blow to abortion rights and could possibly bankrupt Planned Parenthood, one of the nation\u2019s leading providers of healthcare for women. It\u2019s a lawsuit that has been filed by an anti-abortion activist tied to Leo and heard by judges \u2013 from the lower courts to the fifth circuit appeals court \u2013 who are also linked to Leo. Three of the people on the stage at the Federalist Society event in Fort Worth in 2018 \u2013 Kacsmaryk, Jones and Leo \u2013 have all played key roles in the case. Though the stakes in this case couldn\u2019t be higher for one of the nation\u2019s oldest healthcare providers, it is about more than abortion or healthcare. The lawsuit is a parable about Leo\u2019s power amid a presidential election season whose outcome will probably determine to what extent Leo will continue to reshape the makeup and ideology of the nation\u2019s courts. *** The case was filed in February 2021 by an anti-abortion activist who had conducted what he described as an \u201cextensive undercover investigation\u201d of the organization. He accuses Planned Parenthood of fraud \u2013 claiming that it owes $1.8bn in fines, fees and reimbursements to the Medicaid program. It\u2019s an amount that could force the 108-year-old non-profit healthcare provider to shutter clinics across the country. The lawsuit is titled USA v Planned Parenthood because it was filed under a federal whistleblower law that allows citizens to sue on behalf of the US government over allegations that federal programs have been defrauded. It is the latest in a series of legal actions that started in 2015 after Texas\u2019s health officials used footage from the activist\u2019s hidden-camera recordings as a basis to expel Planned Parenthood from the state\u2019s Medicaid program. The activist and his allies claimed the videos showed Planned Parenthood was illegally selling fetal tissue and endangering pregnant people\u2019s health. Planned Parenthood repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Investigations in multiple states triggered by the video resulted in no disciplinary action against the healthcare provider. The US government \u2013 the source of 90% of the Medicaid funds paid to Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas \u2013 disputes that Planned Parenthood owes the federal government money. Federal officials say in a court filing that they found no evidence that Planned Parenthood had improperly billed for its services and that they found no reason Planned Parenthood should have been removed from Medicaid. Experts in healthcare law expected the case to be dismissed quickly. Yet none of these facts are as important to understanding the significance of this case as knowing where it was filed: in the federal courthouse in Amarillo, Texas \u2013 home to zero Planned Parenthood clinics. This wasn\u2019t an accident. The US district court in Amarillo is under the purview of the US fifth circuit court of appeals, making it likely that any upward appeals in Planned Parenthood\u2019s case would be heard in the hard-right appeals court, including by judges appointed by Trump or other conservative stalwarts like Jones. And by the time the Planned Parenthood case was filed, Kacsmaryk \u2013 that young attorney on stage making introductions at the Federalist Society event in Texas \u2013 had been serving as the federal district court judge for Amarillo for nearly two years. Kacsmaryk had been appointed by Trump, who had famously consulted Leo in picking judges for federal appointments. Kacsmaryk was the only judge in the Amarillo court district, and all but guaranteed to hear the Planned Parenthood case. Hundreds of court files, tax records and judges\u2019 financial disclosure forms reviewed by the Guardian show that Kacsmaryk and most of the other key players in the case to topple Planned Parenthood are tied to Leo via a vast network of non-profit and for-profit organizations involved in the fight against abortion or other conservative causes. Tax records analyzed by the Guardian show that a conservative legal non-profit where Kacsmaryk worked before he was appointed to the bench made at least three payments totaling more than $350,000 to a public relations firm, CRC Advisors, that Leo acquired in early 2020. That conservative legal group, First Liberty Institute, made a payment of $137,000 before Kacsmaryk was confirmed as a judge in mid-2019 and before Leo took over the PR firm, tax records show. The next two payments \u2013 totaling more than $230,000 \u2013 were made after Kacsmaryk was sworn in as a district judge, the records show. At least one of those payments was made after Leo had taken over the PR firm, according to First Liberty\u2019s tax filings for 2020 and 2021. First Liberty\u2019s general counsel Hiram Sasser said his organization has worked with CRC Advisors at least dating back to 2015, long before Leo took over the company. Sasser told the Guardian he had never worked with Leo and that Leo\u2019s business partner, Greg Mueller, was the organization\u2019s point of contact. Records also revealed that First Liberty had paid the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys who filed USA v Planned Parenthood, Heather Hacker and Andrew Stephens, more than $500,000 in 2023 in consulting fees. First Liberty\u2019s Sasser said the payment was for the attorneys\u2019 work in another, unrelated case. In other words, Kacsmaryk is ruling in a case in which the attorneys arguing in front of him have received substantial payments from his former employer. First Liberty also employs the spouse of one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. Hacker and Stephens did not respond to multiple attempts to reach them for comment. Some legal ethicists and court watchdog organizations contacted by the Guardian say that this case is another example of the ambiguities of the judiciary\u2019s rules about conflict of interest and recusal rules. The rules require that a judge \u201cshall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d. But it is unclear whether any of the connections between First Liberty, Leo and the attorneys on this case meet that threshold. This case \u201craises the shortcomings in the recusal law when the ties that exist in this case seem fairly obviously to impugn and implicate the bias of the judge who\u2019s hearing the case\u201d, said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for increased transparency and accountability within the court system. Kacsmaryk did not respond to a detailed list of questions provided to him through a court spokesperson. Leo did not reply to most questions sent to him by the Guardian but a spokesperson for him said: \u201cMr Leo has not spoken to Matthew Kacsmaryk since a public encounter in 2019.\u201d Records also show that Leo, a lawyer, provided key legal advice to the anti-abortion activist suing Planned Parenthood. Through generous grants he has provided to law schools and legal organizations, Leo has also helped to underwrite luxury trips to judicial conferences for judges on the fifth circuit court of appeals who have ruled on the Planned Parenthood case. When nearly every person on one side of a legal case and the judge are connected politically or ideologically, it is called court capture \u2013 a term some legal scholars use to describe USA v Planned Parenthood. In a captured court, specific judges, lawyers and even plaintiffs align to produce a specific outcome of a case \u2013 often an outcome that supports beliefs or preferences that tie each of these legal actors together. The shared ideology in this case is ending abortion. \u201cThis is a lawsuit that has no merit, but somehow it\u2019s progressing anyway,\u201d said Nicole Huberfeld, the chair of the health law program at Boston University and the co-director of the university\u2019s program on reproductive justice. \u201cIt seems to me an attempt to try to limit the activities of Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas and Louisiana by any means possible.\u201d The presidential election in November will determine who will nominate the next generation of judges to the federal courts: the former president Donald Trump, whose nominees to the supreme court played a key role in overturning Roe v Wade \u2013 or the vice-president, Kamala Harris, who has staked much of her presidential campaign on restoring abortion rights nationwide. There are currently 44 federal judgeships vacant, with another 23 judges announcing their plans to step down from the bench. *** Lena Zwarensteyn, the fair courts campaign director for the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, describes court capture as a \u201cmanufactured and coordinated effort determined to produce specific outcomes\u201d. Those manufactured efforts, she said, are \u201cjeopardizing the health of pregnant people, jeopardizing even access to contraception, jeopardizing the government\u2019s ability to set forth and enforce civil and human rights protection for access to clean air and water\u201d. Zwarensteyn said the right\u2019s focus on the courts was a reaction to major wins by the civil rights movement in the 1960s and early 70s, including victories expanding voting rights. Groups like the Federalist Society \u2013 an organization dedicated to reforming the court \u201cto place a premium on individual liberty, traditional values, and the rule of law\u201d \u2013 created a pipeline of legal talent ready to fill federal judgeships. In 1986, as a young law student at Cornell Law School, Leo founded a chapter of the group. He eventually ascended the ranks of the organization to become co-chair of its board of directors and build a network of conservative lawyers and law students throughout the country who could be candidates for judgeships throughout the federal system. After Trump was elected president in 2016, he leaned on a list of judicial nominees provided by Leo to fill vacancies, stacking the courts with conservative judges from the district level, to the appellate courts and the supreme court. Trump named 245 federal judges to the bench in his one term, compared with 334 over Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office. Trump ultimately appointed six hard-right judges to the fifth circuit appeals court along with appointing 28 judges to district courts in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi that are under the fifth circuit\u2019s umbrella. The six circuit court appointments helped create an appeals court that is even more Maga than the US supreme court, which itself has been widely condemned for destroying federal protections for abortion rights and other decisions favored by Trump and his supporters. In its most recent term, the supreme court overruled eight of the 11 fifth circuit decisions it took up for consideration \u2013 including reversing rulings by the district judge Kacsmaryk and the fifth circuit appeals court that sought to limit access to mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortions. The fifth circuit\u2019s reversals by the high court were the most for any circuit for the second year in a row. While much public attention is focused on the nominations of supreme court justices and the 100 to 150 cases the high court takes up each year, the workings of the fifth circuit \u2013 and the roughly 5,000 cases it decides each year \u2013 get far less scrutiny. The John Minor Wisdom courthouse in downtown New Orleans where the the fifth circuit is headquartered has become the preferred venue for much of the conservative movement \u2013 so much so that businesses and advocates outside the fifth circuit\u2019s jurisdiction have filed paperwork to incorporate an organization in Texas that only exists on paper or recruited plaintiffs who are tangential to a case but reside within the court\u2019s boundaries. One Trump-appointed district court judge, frustrated by the US chamber of commerce filing a case in Texas by recruiting a Texas bank as a plaintiff even though most of the major players in the suit were in Washington DC, wrote that the \u201cvenue is not a continental breakfast; you cannot pick and choose on a Plaintiff\u2019s whim where and how a lawsuit is filed\u201d. District and appeals court judges in the fifth circuit are well known to big businesses trying to skirt financial and environmental regulations, political operatives looking to dilute the voting power of marginalized communities, anti-immigration advocates looking to undercut asylum law and anti-abortion activists seeking to limit legal access to reproductive care \u2013 as in the case in Amarillo that attempts to force Planned Parenthood to pay out more than $1.8bn. *** The origins of USA v Planned Parenthood trace back to a conservative activist from California named David Daleiden who described his anti-abortion positions as his birthright. In media interviews he described himself as a \u201cchild of a crisis pregnancy\u201d and said \u201cthere were people who said I should be aborted\u201d. Daleiden formed an anti-abortion group at his high school. In college he co-authored an article about the emotional toll of abortions on physicians performing them. By 2013, when was in his mid-20s, he founded a non-profit called the Center for Medical Progress with the mission of using undercover journalism to \u201cactively oppose the exploitation of any class of human beings, whether born or unborn\u201d, according to its tax filings. In a draft proposal for a hidden-camera investigation of Planned Parenthood, Daleiden crafted a plan for a \u201ccutting edge expos\u00e9 of the commercial exploitation of aborted fetuses\u201d using \u201cgotcha undercover videos\u201d that would show doctors \u201ccannibalizing the young and playing God\u201d. By 2014, he was secretly recording healthcare providers discussing fetal tissue procedures at abortion conferences in California and Maryland. Though the Center for Medical Progress listed Daleiden as its only employee on its tax forms, he had help from Leo and other conservative activists during his undercover investigation in 2014 and 2015. In an affidavit, Daleiden said he consulted Leo \u201cabout how to ensure successful prosecutions of various entities illegally profiting from the sale of fetal tissue\u201d. To handle public relations for his group, Daleiden hired Leo\u2019s business partner, Mueller, a political consultant and messaging specialist. Daleiden did not reply to multiple emails and phone messages seeking comment for this story. In April 2015, Daleiden talked his way into a tour of a Planned Parenthood office in Houston. He and another activist posed as representatives of a company that specialized in procuring fetal tissue for researchers. Scientists use the tissue to try to develop cures for diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. The advocates surreptitiously recorded their conversations with Melissa Farrell, a Planned Parenthood research coordinator, and a physician with the clinic. Daleiden asked Farrell about how the tissue would be treated and preserved. Farrell gave a rambling, sometimes confusing answer, telling Daleiden the Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast affiliate had extensive experience in working with researchers to meet their needs. At one point, she told Daleiden that in meeting the needs of researchers, there were times when \u201cwe deviate from our standards\u201d. Daleiden saw that phrase and other parts of the recordings as evidence that Planned Parenthood was violating federal laws governing the collection of fetal tissue. Farrell later explained in a sworn statement that she meant clinic procedures \u2013 not medical procedures \u2013 could be altered to minimize disruption at the clinic and \u201cwould never be done in a way that involves suboptimal care for patients\u201d. In July and August 2015, Daleiden shared the videos with state officials in Texas and released them publicly. He went on Fox News to accuse Planned Parenthood of \u201charvesting and selling\u201d baby parts. The officials who received the videos included Ken Paxton, the state attorney general, and Stuart Bowen, the then inspector general for the state\u2019s health and human services department. Bowen was a longtime Republican operative in Texas who had worked for George W Bush when Bush was governor and later president. Bowen later testified that he watched the roughly eight hours of video Daleiden provided five times. He determined that Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast did not follow mandatory safety requirements for handling fetal tissue and that the clinic violated medical standards by agreeing to alter the method or timing of an abortion in order to obtain fetal tissue. Federal law prohibits changing the time or manner of an abortion for the purposes of collecting fetal tissue. The idea behind these provisions is to ensure the pregnant person\u2019s wellbeing is prioritized over the researcher\u2019s interest in getting tissue samples. Bowen sought a second opinion from his agency\u2019s chief medical officer \u2013 an orthopedic surgeon who admitted he was not familiar with abortion procedures \u2013 before concluding that the state\u2019s Planned Parenthood clinics were \u201cno longer capable of performing medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical manner\u201d. Bowen\u2019s office sent a letter in October 2015 terminating the Planned Parenthood clinic in Houston, where the video was filmed, from receiving funds though the Texas Medicaid program. The same termination letter also went to Planned Parenthood chapters based in Dallas and San Antonio \u2013 which oversee dozens of clinics across the state that had not been included in the undercover videos and were not involved in fetal tissue donations. Bowen\u2019s decision meant that roughly 11,000 Texas women enrolled in Medicaid would have to seek care somewhere other than Planned Parenthood \u2013 not only for abortions but also for breast cancer screenings, wellness exams and other services provided by the clinics. The clinics with headquarters in Houston, Dallas and San Antonio operate under the Planned Parenthood name and follow marketing, legal and safety requirements set by the national federation, but say they are separate entities, each with its own board of directors and leadership teams. Bowen did not return multiple messages seeking comment. The Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas, with help from lawyers from the national federation, responded to Bowen\u2019s edict by filing a lawsuit in federal court based in Austin. Along with the affiliates, the suit listed 11 Jane Doe patients as plaintiffs. The suit \u2013 Planned Parenthood v Smith \u2013 charged that these Medicaid patients were being denied the right, under federal law, to choose a qualified medical provider. In January 2017, the US district court judge Sam Sparks convened a hearing to determine whether Planned Parenthood should be allowed to remain in the Medicaid program while the case was pending. Sparks, a Republican appointed to the bench in 1991 by George HW Bush, listened to three days of testimony from Bowen, Planned Parenthood employees and other witnesses. In a 42-page opinion, Sparks wrote that the secretly recorded videos and aliases used by the film-makers gave the case the feel of a \u201cbest-selling novel rather than a case involving the interplay of federal and state authority through the Medicaid program. Yet rather than a villain plotting to take over the world, the subject of this case is the State of Texas\u2019s efforts to expel a group of health care providers from a social health care program for families and individuals with limited resources.\u201d He summarized Daleiden\u2019s video as \u201cnothing more than confused and ambiguous dialogue\u201d. The Planned Parenthood employee who commented about deviating from the organization\u2019s standard shifted between talking about administrative and medical processes, making the comments \u201copen to interpretation\u201d, the judge wrote. All that was certain, according to Sparks, was that Bowen and his department did not have \u201ceven a scintilla of evidence\u201d to prove Planned Parenthood had done anything wrong. Sparks granted Planned Parenthood an injunction that allowed the Texas clinics to continue providing care to Medicaid patients \u2013 at least until the entire case could be heard. Lawyers for the state of Texas did not give Sparks a chance to hold a full hearing of the case. Instead, they pushed the case to a higher authority: the fifth circuit court of appeals. *** In June 2019, about a year after the fifth circuit judge Edith Jones took the microphone to introduce Leo and the supreme court justice Thomas at the Federalist Society event in Fort Worth, she and two other appeals judges took the bench to hear the state of Texas argue that Sparks was wrong in granting Planned Parenthood an injunction. Jones, who had been appointed to the fifth circuit by Ronald Reagan in 1985, had stirred some controversies during her more than three decades on the court. In 2013, attendees at a talk she gave at a Federalist Society event in Pennsylvania alleged she told the crowd that Black and Latino people were more \u201cprone\u201d to commit acts of violence. An investigation led by the future US attorney general Merrick Garland determined there was insufficient evidence to establish whether Jones had violated any rules or substantiate what she had told the crowd. Hacker, who at the time was serving as a lawyer for the state attorney general\u2019s office, told the three judges that Sparks had erred in determining that there wasn\u2019t evidence that Planned Parenthood had ever sold any fetal tissue or broken any laws in obtaining it. He should have looked at the case strictly from an administrative perspective and how the policies and procedures allow the state of Texas to control its Medicaid program, Hacker said. As Planned Parenthood\u2019s attorney, Jennifer Sandman, tried to lay out why Sparks\u2019s ruling was sound, Jones interrupted her with an example that seemed far afield from the dispute over fetal tissue and Medicaid payments. She brought up a Philadelphia doctor convicted of first-degree murder for killing three babies born alive by stabbing them with scissors. Using the Philadelphia doctor as an example, Jones asked if a state could ever be allowed to make a judgment to expel a provider. Then she switched gears and described a Planned Parenthood provider on one of the undercover videos who \u201cgiggled\u201d as she discussed procuring fetal tissues. \u201cYour honor, I would deeply disagree with that characterization,\u201d Sandman said. \u201cShe definitely smirked,\u201d Jones shot back. Six months after the hearing, the panel issued its ruling. The decision, written by Jones, acknowledged that Judge Sparks had not found any evidence of wrongdoing by the Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast employees captured on video, but complained that the judge had accepted \u201cself-serving\u201d testimony from Planned Parenthood\u2019s witnesses while \u201crefusing to consider\u201d evidence from Bowen\u2019s office. The case wasn\u2019t about abortion, she wrote, \u201cdespite being litigated with the trappings of the abortion debate, this is fundamentally a statutory construction case, not an abortion case\u201d. Twenty-six pages earlier in her opinion, she included a screengrab from Daleiden\u2019s video that showed fetal parts \u2013 with a tiny finger and partial limb visible swimming in a clear, glass baking dish. Through a court spokesperson, Jones declined to comment for this story. Jones and the other two judges on the panel voted 3-0 to vacate the injunction that allowed Planned Parenthood to remain in Medicaid. Jones\u2019s opinion also called for the entire fifth circuit \u2013 not just a three-judge panel \u2013 to consider an issue that Texas\u2019s attorney, Hacker, had raised in her argument. Did the women receiving care at Planned Parenthood even have a right to sue over the state\u2019s decision to block the healthcare provider from Medicaid? *** By 2020, Trump, with help from Leo, has pushed the fifth circuit court of appeals from a conservative court to a far-right bastion. All six of the judges that Trump appointed to the appeals court had claimed membership in Leo\u2019s Federalist Society. One of them, James Ho, wrote on a questionnaire during his confirmation process that he had not missed the group\u2019s annual conference in 20 years and had met his future wife at a gathering of the group. Four of the Trump appointees also accepted trips to legal conferences underwritten by the law school at George Mason University, to which Leo was a regular and generous contributor. Most of the judges appointed to the fifth circuit by Trump also had ties to conservative politics or politicians. Ho served in the George W Bush White House in the Office of Legal Counsel and as solicitor general of Texas, a post in which he fought against same-sex marriage. Stuart Kyle Duncan had also come out of the Texas solicitor general\u2019s office known as a laboratory in which to test ultra conservative legal strategies in cases involving transgender rights, voting rights, and same-sex marriage. Don Willett worked on the 2000 Bush-Cheney presidential campaign and transition team before landing on the Texas state supreme court. All six came to the court with avowed anti-abortion stances. *** Appeals from district court cases to federal circuit courts generally are decided by a three-judge panel selected from the larger pool of appellate judges within the circuit court \u2013 like the panel led by Jones in 2019 that ended Planned Parenthood\u2019s bid to remain in the Medicaid program while the case was pending. But rulings by these three-judge panels can be reviewed by the full contingent of appellate judges in that circuit. In November 2020, four of the Trump-appointed judges were among the 16 fifth circuit jurists who addressed Jones\u2019s request that the full circuit court determine whether Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients had the right to sue in federal court to challenge Texas authorities\u2019 decision to banish the healthcare provider from Medicaid. The lawyers arguing the Medicaid recipients\u2019 claims had a large body of law supporting their position. Six federal circuit courts had previously ruled that Medicaid beneficiaries have a right to sue if they had been denied access to their medical providers \u2013 including a ruling three years earlier by a three-judge panel within the fifth circuit. Only one circuit court had ruled in the other direction. The fifth circuit ruled that the Jane Doe plaintiffs did not have standing to sue in federal court, saying that most other circuits\u2019 reasoning on the issue was \u201cdemonstrably incorrect\u201d. That majority ruling was supported in whole or in part by 14 judges, swamping the two judges who voted against the decision. Planned Parenthood\u2019s appeals to remain in Texas\u2019s Medicaid program were over. *** For Daleiden, the anti-abortion activist, the appeals court ruling was the first victory after a string of defeats in other venues. Investigations inspired by his videos in at least 13 states did not produce actions against Planned Parenthood affiliates in their jurisdictions. Probes by the Texas Rangers and the Harris county district attorney\u2019s office \u2013 whose jurisdiction includes Houston \u2013 also found no wrongdoing by the clinics. Daleiden also suffered repercussions in his home state. In 2016, Kamala Harris, then the California attorney general, sent investigators to raid Daleiden\u2019s home. That probe provided the evidence used by Harris\u2019s successor, Xavier Becerra, to file a 15-count criminal complaint against Daleiden accusing him of illegal eavesdropping and recording people without their consent. His criminal trial is slated for December. Daleiden has pleaded not guilty. Meanwhile, a federal judge in San Francisco hit Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress with a $2m judgment in a civil case filed by the National Abortion Federation, ruling he had violated the law by secretly recording Planned Parenthood employees and other attendees at conferences organized by the NAF around the country. But as the defeats piled up, two members of the Federalist Society advanced a new strategy that tested the strength of the captured courts Leo had spent over two decades building \u2013 and pushed forward Daleiden\u2019s campaign against Planned Parenthood on a new legal front. Hacker, the attorney who had once represented Texas \u2013 arguing in front of Judge Jones that the Jane Doe patients of Planned Parenthood did not have the standing to sue \u2013 had left the attorney general\u2019s office and entered private practice. She and another former attorney in the attorney general\u2019s office, Stephens, had formed their own private firm. Both were members of the Federalist Society, and have represented organizations that have received funding from Leo\u2019s non-profit network. Through a spokesperson, Leo said he had never met Hacker or Stephens. In 2021, Hacker and Stephens used the US False Claims Act to file a suit in Kacsmaryk\u2019s federal district court in the Texas Panhandle alleging Planned Parenthood owes more than $1.8bn to the government for the payments it received from the time Planned Parenthood clinics were first given notice of their termination in 2015 until the fifth circuit ended Sparks\u2019s injunction in 2020. In court records, the person initiating the case is identified by a pseudonym, Alex Doe. But the details described in the lawsuit and other court documents \u2013 including the undercover video sting \u2013 make it clear that Alex Doe is Daleiden. By filing in Amarillo, the lawyers landed Daleiden\u2019s case in a courtroom presided over by a judge who embraces a family legacy of staunch anti-abortion beliefs \u2013 Kacsmaryk\u2019s mother worked at crisis pregnancy centers that pushed alternatives to abortions, and his wife once posted a photo online of one of their children in a T-shirt that read \u201cI survived Roe v Wade.\u201d Hacker and Stephens\u2019s former boss, Paxton, a member of the Republican Attorneys General Association that receives funding from Leo\u2019s organizations and had appointed Leo to his transition team after taking office, signed on to the lawsuit. Experts interviewed by the Guardian struggled to come up with other examples of when a court ordered an organization to pay back funds it had collected during an injunction. Lawyers for Planned Parenthood have pointed out that the US government has repeatedly asserted in court records that Planned Parenthood should not have been disqualified from the program. The False Claims Act usually applies when healthcare providers bill for services they did not provide. \u201cThis is just not an appropriate False Claims Act case,\u201d said Dr Abigail R Moncrieff, a professor of health and constitutional law at Cleveland State University. \u201cIf Texas and Louisiana wanted their money back, they should just ask for their money back. But they didn\u2019t. \u201cThe whole concept of a whistleblower is that it\u2019s supposed to reveal secret information that the state didn\u2019t know about, and the states here knew about it, and they have not asked for their money back,\u201d she said. Kacsmaryk seems unconvinced. In October 2023 he declined to dismiss the case, writing that Planned Parenthood clinics \u201cwere not entitled to the payments and were obligated to return them at least within 60 days\u201d of their expulsion, he wrote. \u201cNo other argument advanced by Defendants convinces the Court otherwise.\u201d Kacsmaryk reached back to a 1919 supreme court decision about injunctions to support his reasoning. That case predated women\u2019s right to vote by nearly a year. The case is on hold in Kacsmaryk\u2019s court as the Planned Parenthood Federation of America \u2013 the administrative headquarters rather than medical providers \u2013 fights Kacsmaryk\u2019s refusal to dismiss the federation from the lawsuit. Since the federation in New York does not provide procedures or bill Medicaid, it should not be subject to Daleiden\u2019s suit, the national group has argued. The appeals court\u2019s decision could come any day. Then the larger questions about whether Planned Parenthood should have to repay Medicaid will resume in Kacsmaryk\u2019s courtroom. If Kacsmaryk finds in Daleiden\u2019s favor, the activist can collect as much as 30% of the fees and fines imposed on Planned Parenthood. On the other side, legal fees keep mounting for the clinics. \u201cEvery dollar, every moment, spent on anything but our mission to provide \u2026 care is a distraction,\u201d said Laura Terrill, Planned Parenthood South Texas\u2019s chief executive officer. Meanwhile, as Planned Parenthood\u2019s fate depends on the courts, the teen birth rate in Texas rose in 2022 for the first time in 15 years.

As the institute has made its hard-right, pro-Trump drift in recent years, Klingenstein has continued to publicly describe US politics with extremist rhetoric, calling it a \u201ccold civil war\u201d, and has encouraged rightwingers to join the fight to defeat what he calls \u201cthe woke regime\u201d.</p> <p>His spending puts him at the forefront of a class of donors who are explicitly supporting more extreme and polarizing politics in Trump\u2019s Republican party.</p> <p>The largesse has already dwarfed his contributions in previous election seasons.

In documents pitching the idea of the site during late 2021, Yenor wrote that the site\u2019s goal was to \u201ctranslate anti-critical-race-theory (anti-CRT) movement and anti-lockdown movements into a durable political movement to radicalize political opinion in Idaho and shape the primaries to the advantage of conservatives\u201d. Yenor used the now defunct website and an associated account on Twitter/X to make rightwing attacks on Idaho politicians and activists, including Republicans. Last August, the Guardian reported on Klingenstein\u2019s growing largesse including his donations to his own Pac, American Firebrand, whose funds were spent in part on producing a series of videos that showcased Klingenstein\u2019s apocalyptic vision of US politics.

They backed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/16/san-francisco-school-board-recall\">recall</a> of several discredited members of the San Francisco school board. They threw their weight behind centrist candidates for board of supervisors seats. They weren\u2019t always united in all their causes, but together, \u201cthey are spending insane amounts of money on local elections,\u201d and they are \u201cout to bring the hyper-progressive elements in San Francisco government down\u201d, said McBride.</p>    <h2><strong>Several challengers, similar policies</strong></h2> <p>Breed, too, has embraced law-and-order policies as a way out of the emergency. She supported the recall of Boudin \u2013 replacing him with a political ally \u2013 as well as the recall of the school board members.</p> <p>This spring, she boosted ballot measures that gave the police department more power to use surveillance tools and that instituted drug tests for local welfare recipients. On her campaign website, she touts among her successes doubling drug arrests in 2023, and said she hopes to expand a program in which city officials buy homeless people bus tickets out of town, with a target of \u201c1,000 people per year\u201d.</p> <p>Many observers say that Breed\u2019s leading mayoral challengers are not suggesting substantially different policies \u2013 with all of them promising to clear away the unhoused people sleeping in tents on streets and in public parks, expand the number of city police officers and put an end to public drug use.</p> <p>\u201cThe current mayor, and all of the prospective mayors, their aim right now is not to solve homelessness or fix homelessness or even shelter homeless people, it\u2019s just to get them out of sight,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cWe\u2019re back in the 90s. Wide leg pants are in, Birkenstocks are in and so is law and order and mass incarceration.\u201d</p>    <p>The number of people who are being evicted or losing access to shelter in San Francisco is constantly overwhelming the city\u2019s ability to house them, Sparks said. An honest reckoning with California\u2019s housing shortage, a massive problem that was decades in the making, would probably require both statewide and federal action, he argued.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just tech billionaires who want a quicker fix, he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s the average San Francisco voter that is really demanding that they don\u2019t want to see people living on the streets.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about critics who said Breed\u2019s law-and-order approach marked a return to 1990s policies, Joe Arellano, a Breed campaign spokesperson, said in a statement that \u201cSan Francisco is a city that believes in and offers second chances, but it is also a city of accountability\u201d. He also noted that Breed had been endorsed by the San Francisco police union.</p> <p>The conservative media\u2019s depiction of San Francisco as a bastion of far-left policies has always been a fiction, said Jason McDaniel, a political scientist at San Francisco State University. Just look at the national politicians who have emerged from San Francisco: Dianne Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, Gavin Newsom, and Kamala Harris, people \u201cpretty close to the center of the Democratic party\u201d, he said.</p> <p>The city\u2019s current debate is still \u201cfirmly liberal\u201d, he argued. \u201cSan Francisco voters are still compassionate. They\u2019re willing to spend a lot of money on government services,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conservative approach, which is, \u2018Let\u2019s not \u201cwaste\u201d money on people who don\u2019t deserve it.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re back in the 90s.

Critics point at a crippling bureaucracy, inefficient local government and several corruption scandals.</p> <h2><strong> Measured success and divided donors</strong></h2> <p>Breed\u2019s chances of re-election may have slightly improved over the past year, as she has appeared to make progress in some of her goals.</p> <p>A recent analysis from the Associated Press found that many streets in San Francisco were now empty of tents and other makeshift encampments. The number of people sleeping outdoors dropped to under 3,000 in January, the lowest the city has recorded in a decade, according to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/homelessness-increase-rent-hud-covid-60bd88687e1aef1b02d25425798bd3b1\">a federal count</a>. The number has likely dropped even lower as a result of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/san-francisco-mayor-california-homeless-encampments-3f8b79c8446bb60b5168711f8b06695c\">ramped up enforcement</a> of anti-camping laws following the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-homeless-camping-bans-506ac68dc069e3bf456c10fcedfa6bee\">supreme court</a> decision in August, the AP said.</p> <p>But even as tents have disappeared, the total number of unhoused people in San Francisco has grown by 7%, according to the same federal count.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>People living on the street are feeling embattled.

The Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has donated hundreds of thousands to Breed\u2019s re-election campaign. The billionaire William Oberndorf gave $500,000 to Farrell\u2019s campaign, and the former supervisor has won the backing of several other figures from the real estate and finance sectors. Lurie, the Levi Strauss heir, has poured more than $8m of his own money into his mayoral campaign. His mother also spent $1m to back his campaign.</p>    <p>As the race for that role enters its final weeks, allegations of improper financial behavior are shadowing both Breed and Farrell. A city official who led Breed\u2019s \u201cDream Keepers Initiative\u201d initiative went on leave in September, after investigations by the San Francisco Chronicle and the SF Standard <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/sf-department-head-leave-absence-investigation-19761527.php\">raised questions about the official\u2019s spending</a>, including <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2024/09/12/san-francisco-dream-keeper-initiative-sheryl-davis-james-spingola-nonprofit/\">$1.5m in contracts</a> she approved for a non-profit run by a man with whom she shared an address. It wasn\u2019t the first time that close associates of the mayor have run into ethics problems: Breed was for a time in a relationship with the city\u2019s former director of public works, who later pleaded guilty to fraud and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-san-francisco-public-works-director-admits-string-briberies-and-corruption\">public corruption charges</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Farrell is facing accusations that his campaign is using a fund ostensibly dedicated to supporting a local ballot initiative to improperly funnel money to his mayoral campaign and dodge campaign finance limits.</p> <p>None of the three leading campaigns made their candidates available for a phone interview with the Guardian, and Farrell\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions.</p> <p>Arellano, Breed\u2019s campaign spokesperson, said in a statement that the mayor had led \u201cthe biggest anti-corruption clean-up in our city\u2019s history\u201d and that \u201cnearly all the recent examples in the news were identified because of the process she initiated to root out waste, fraud and abuse\u201d.</p> <p>Breed had acted swiftly in response to the news about the \u201cunfortunate events\u201d at the Dream Keepers Initiative, including asking the director to resign, and \u201cremains committed to the program\u201d, he said.</p> <p>In the wake of the investigation into Farrell and the Dream Keepers Initiative, the Chronicle\u2019s editorial board announced that though Breed was a \u201csafe choice\u201d for mayor, it was endorsing Lurie as <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/mark-farrell-loan-disclosure-house-19808908.php\">someone who could bring much-needed change</a> to the city government.</p> <p>The Chronicle\u2019s endorsement was blunt: \u201cIs Lurie\u2019s inexperience concerning? Absolutely \u2026 We won\u2019t sugarcoat the reality that supporting Lurie is a risk.\u201d</p> <p>Though Lurie\u2019s plans offered \u201ca welcome balance of compassion and toughness\u201d, some of his promises for addressing the homelessness crisis were \u201chyperbolic\u201d or even, frankly, \u201ca fantasy\u201d, the paper noted.</p> <p>But the Chronicle argued that Lurie\u2019s measured demeanour and extensive, if \u201cunearned\u201d, family connections, would likely enable him to hire and manage an impressive staff of city employees, who might be able to do a better job on day-to-day governance issues than Breed had done.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>They are telling themselves because they are successful in technology they know ... government or crime or housing or homelessness</p> <footer> <cite>Eric Jaye</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lurie has been running a \u201cvery outsider, populist campaign\u201d, arguing that his lack of experience in city hall \u201cis a good thing, from his point of view\u201d, McDaniel, the political scientist, said. That kind of message, from a \u201cvery rich person\u201d who has spent more on his own campaign than all the other candidates combined, is not one that McDaniel expected would resonate with San Francisco voters. But, he said, Lurie \u201chas done better than I thought, and he could still win\u201d.</p> <p>San Franciscans will use a ranked-choice voting process to select a mayor in November, meaning that candidates can pick up second and third-choice votes in the race from supporters of other candidates. Voters who support Peskin, the underdog progressive candidate, will probably be one of the key second choice vote swing groups. So far, influential local progressives have divided on who to endorse as their second choice, with some choosing Lurie, and others, Breed, McBride, the politics professor, said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all just messy,\u201d she said. The Chronicle\u2019s latest poll, from mid-October, showed Lurie <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/sf-mayor-poll-result-19827236.php\">surging to first place.</a></p> <p>Breed\u2019s spokesperson accused Lurie and his family of trying to \u201cbuy the election\u201d, and said: \u201cLurie would be at 1% if he wasn\u2019t spending an unprecedented amount of money to cover up the fact that he has no experience to be mayor.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Lurie\u2019s campaign responded that Breed and Farrell also had billionaire backers: \u201cTheir attempts to cry foul about a resource disadvantage are the result of bad strategy and tactical blunders \u2013 not an actual lack of resources.\u201d</p> <p>Jaye, the longtime Democratic consultant, said that he believed that some of the city\u2019s ascendant tech donors are \u201cwell-meaning, but arrogant and naive\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey are telling themselves because they are successful in technology that they know a lot about government or crime or housing or homelessness.\u201d</p> <p>Their involvement has sometimes turned up the temperature of the campaign, with inflammatory late night tweets upping the ante. Elon Musk, whose political donations are playing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/18/elon-musk-trump-election-influence\">outsized role</a> in the presidential race, has <a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2023/10/elon-musk-calls-for-jailing-san-francisco-supervisor-again/\">repeatedly tweeted</a> that progressive city officials in San Francisco should be put in prison. Garry Tan, the CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator and a prominent political donor, sparked a police investigation after he tweeted the names of seven city supervisors, including Peskin, saying they should \u201c<a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2024/01/garry-tan-death-wish-sf-supervisors/\">die slow motherfuckers</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Local tech leaders have also been working for years to \u201cremake\u201d the city \u201cso it\u2019s their San Francisco, not the San Francisco of the people who live here now\u201d, Jaye argued.</p> <p>While Musk announced this summer that he would be moving the headquarters of X, his struggling social media platform, out of San Francisco, new, more ascendant tech startups are moving in. OpenAI, a major player in artificial intelligence, reportedly leased a <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/realestate/article/sf-openai-office-lease-19476729.php\">second office space</a> in San Francisco in September, part of a reported <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2024/08/29/measuring-ai-growth-in-sf-through-office-space/\">boom in AI businesses</a> renting office space in the city.</p> <p>You have to \u201cfollow the money\u201d, Jaye said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably five times more than has ever been spent in an election cycle in San Francisco, and we\u2019re not done.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the supreme court\u2019s conservative majority ruled this summer that cities could fine and jail unhoused people for sleeping on the streets, London Breed, the Democratic mayor of famously liberal San Francisco, greeted the decision as a victory. With more than 8,000 people in the city unhoused, Breed has increasingly embraced law-and-order policies. The supreme court\u2019s ruling would \u201chelp cities like San Francisco manage our public spaces more effectively and efficiently\u201d, she argued. Homelessness has been an enduring challenge for San Francisco\u2019s leaders, including for Breed. The relentless emergency is one of the top issues in this year\u2019s elections in the city, and Breed\u2019s re-election is uncertain. She\u2019s facing a host of Democratic challengers \u2013 the most prominent of whom are echoing her law-and-order rhetoric. Mark Farrell, a venture capitalist, former interim mayor and former member of the board of supervisors, has said he wants to call in armed national guard troops to deal with the city\u2019s fentanyl crisis and would embrace \u201czero tolerance\u201d and abstinence-focused responses to addiction as mayor. Daniel Lurie, a former non-profit executive and an heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, whose billionaire mother is backing his campaign, has proposed using ankle monitors and geolocation technology to ban people arrested for drug dealing from returning to certain city neighborhoods. \u201cIt\u2019s basically Find My iPhone for drug dealers,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is time to end the perception that lawlessness is an acceptable part of life in San Francisco,\u201d Lurie pledged on his campaign website. The only progressive in the mayor\u2019s race, the longtime city supervisor Aaron Peskin, was polling so far behind over the summer that the Los Angeles Times ran a story on it. His ratings have increased slightly since then, but he is still expected to lose the race. The tough-on-crime mayoral rhetoric has fueled national headlines about San Francisco voters moving to the right. But local political experts point out that the city\u2019s leadership has long been more centrist than its international reputation might suggest. Local residents and business owners have described a tension between wanting to fix the humanitarian crisis they see playing out around them, and worrying about the optics of the crisis for themselves and for the city, which has long been dependent on tourist dollars. \u201cPeople in San Francisco don\u2019t like to see poverty. They can be very liberal at a distance,\u201d said Tony Sparks, an urban policy expert at San Francisco State University. The city is built on \u201ca very boom and bust economy, and during the boom times, people don\u2019t want to see the leftovers of the bust times\u201d. What is new is the growing political engagement of a generation of tech executives and investors in the region, many of whom have come to believe that progressive policies that guided the city during the pandemic and in the wake of the 2020 George Floyd uprising have set the city on the wrong track. They\u2019re using their wealth and their public social media platforms \u2013 both sizable \u2013 in an effort to reshape the city\u2019s politics, spending millions on local races. Money has always played a role in the city\u2019s politics, but the mayor\u2019s race is expected to be the most expensive in San Francisco history. Slow pandemic recovery and flexing of money Breed was elected in 2018 as the first Black woman to become mayor of San Francisco. She brought personal experience to many of the city\u2019s struggles: she grew up in public housing, lost a younger sister to a drug overdose, and has a brother who is incarcerated. A longtime community activist, she was known as a centrist, one with significant support from the city\u2019s business and tech elite. She has long argued that her approach to the homelessness and addiction crises is shaped not by rich donors, but by the views of San Francisco\u2019s middle-class and working-class residents. Since the pandemic, those dual crises seem to only have grown, while yet others have appeared on the horizon. Most US cities bounced back quickly after the early pandemic: San Francisco did not. The transition to remote work turned its downtown business district into a shadow of itself. The much emptier streets made homelessness and public drug use \u2013 including more than 3,000 people living unsheltered on the streets or in tents \u2013 more visible and more unsettling, giving way to a national debate over whether the city was caught in a \u201cdoom loop\u201d, in which the struggling downtown area would never be able to attract back the office workers, shoppers, and tourists it desperately needed to survive. The city\u2019s public schools\u2019 pandemic closures lasted much longer than in other parts of the country, sparking frustration among some parents. Accidental drug overdose deaths have claimed between 600 and 810 lives a year since 2020. Concerns about safety in the city were never supported by violent crime statistics, which have continued to show that San Francisco is relatively safe among large American cities. But they were confirmed by people\u2019s visual experiences downtown, said Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who has worked in San Francisco politics for decades. People are unlikely to feel safe when they see people injecting drugs on the street or living in tents in public spaces. San Francisco\u2019s pandemic-related crisis were a regular laughingstock on Fox News, where Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson railed that California\u2019s ultra-left politicians were reaping what they sowed. And while a caricature, the argument that progressive government was at least partly to blame for some of the problems resonated with many tech leaders and venture capitalists in the region, said Keally McBride, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. Funneling money through a network of locally-focused \u201cgrey money\u201d groups, tech, real estate and venture capitalist leaders bankrolled the successful recall of Chesa Boudin, San Francisco\u2019s young, progressive district attorney. They backed the recall of several discredited members of the San Francisco school board. They threw their weight behind centrist candidates for board of supervisors seats. They weren\u2019t always united in all their causes, but together, \u201cthey are spending insane amounts of money on local elections,\u201d and they are \u201cout to bring the hyper-progressive elements in San Francisco government down\u201d, said McBride. Several challengers, similar policies Breed, too, has embraced law-and-order policies as a way out of the emergency. She supported the recall of Boudin \u2013 replacing him with a political ally \u2013 as well as the recall of the school board members. This spring, she boosted ballot measures that gave the police department more power to use surveillance tools and that instituted drug tests for local welfare recipients. On her campaign website, she touts among her successes doubling drug arrests in 2023, and said she hopes to expand a program in which city officials buy homeless people bus tickets out of town, with a target of \u201c1,000 people per year\u201d. Many observers say that Breed\u2019s leading mayoral challengers are not suggesting substantially different policies \u2013 with all of them promising to clear away the unhoused people sleeping in tents on streets and in public parks, expand the number of city police officers and put an end to public drug use. \u201cThe current mayor, and all of the prospective mayors, their aim right now is not to solve homelessness or fix homelessness or even shelter homeless people, it\u2019s just to get them out of sight,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cWe\u2019re back in the 90s. Wide leg pants are in, Birkenstocks are in and so is law and order and mass incarceration.\u201d The number of people who are being evicted or losing access to shelter in San Francisco is constantly overwhelming the city\u2019s ability to house them, Sparks said. An honest reckoning with California\u2019s housing shortage, a massive problem that was decades in the making, would probably require both statewide and federal action, he argued. But it\u2019s not just tech billionaires who want a quicker fix, he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s the average San Francisco voter that is really demanding that they don\u2019t want to see people living on the streets.\u201d Asked about critics who said Breed\u2019s law-and-order approach marked a return to 1990s policies, Joe Arellano, a Breed campaign spokesperson, said in a statement that \u201cSan Francisco is a city that believes in and offers second chances, but it is also a city of accountability\u201d. He also noted that Breed had been endorsed by the San Francisco police union. The conservative media\u2019s depiction of San Francisco as a bastion of far-left policies has always been a fiction, said Jason McDaniel, a political scientist at San Francisco State University. Just look at the national politicians who have emerged from San Francisco: Dianne Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, Gavin Newsom, and Kamala Harris, people \u201cpretty close to the center of the Democratic party\u201d, he said. The city\u2019s current debate is still \u201cfirmly liberal\u201d, he argued. \u201cSan Francisco voters are still compassionate. They\u2019re willing to spend a lot of money on government services,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conservative approach, which is, \u2018Let\u2019s not \u201cwaste\u201d money on people who don\u2019t deserve it.\u2019\u201d But having invested public money in city services for addiction, mental health treatment and other issues, many liberal voters are upset to still see so much public disorder in the streets, McDaniel said. \u201cPoliticians are saying part of the problem is people are rejecting those services \u2013 not going to homeless shelters,\u201d for instance. Critics point at a crippling bureaucracy, inefficient local government and several corruption scandals. Measured success and divided donors Breed\u2019s chances of re-election may have slightly improved over the past year, as she has appeared to make progress in some of her goals. A recent analysis from the Associated Press found that many streets in San Francisco were now empty of tents and other makeshift encampments. The number of people sleeping outdoors dropped to under 3,000 in January, the lowest the city has recorded in a decade, according to a federal count. The number has likely dropped even lower as a result of ramped up enforcement of anti-camping laws following the supreme court decision in August, the AP said. But even as tents have disappeared, the total number of unhoused people in San Francisco has grown by 7%, according to the same federal count. Steven Burcell, who is living in a tiny cabin provided by the city, told the AP that unhoused friends of his had all of their possessions taken by the city in one of the encampment \u201csweeps\u201d. \u201cNow they have nothing. They don\u2019t have any shelter at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just kind of wander around and take buses, like a lot of people do.\u201d The increased enforcement and intense political rhetoric about homelessness are taking a toll on the people at the heart of the debate, Sparks said. \u201cPeople living on the street are feeling embattled. They\u2019re stressed. They\u2019re having to constantly be on the move and on the lookout,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen sweeps go up, people hide.\u201d The tech donors are divided over who they want to see as mayor. The Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has donated hundreds of thousands to Breed\u2019s re-election campaign. The billionaire William Oberndorf gave $500,000 to Farrell\u2019s campaign, and the former supervisor has won the backing of several other figures from the real estate and finance sectors. Lurie, the Levi Strauss heir, has poured more than $8m of his own money into his mayoral campaign. His mother also spent $1m to back his campaign. As the race for that role enters its final weeks, allegations of improper financial behavior are shadowing both Breed and Farrell. A city official who led Breed\u2019s \u201cDream Keepers Initiative\u201d initiative went on leave in September, after investigations by the San Francisco Chronicle and the SF Standard raised questions about the official\u2019s spending, including $1.5m in contracts she approved for a non-profit run by a man with whom she shared an address. It wasn\u2019t the first time that close associates of the mayor have run into ethics problems: Breed was for a time in a relationship with the city\u2019s former director of public works, who later pleaded guilty to fraud and public corruption charges. Meanwhile, Farrell is facing accusations that his campaign is using a fund ostensibly dedicated to supporting a local ballot initiative to improperly funnel money to his mayoral campaign and dodge campaign finance limits. None of the three leading campaigns made their candidates available for a phone interview with the Guardian, and Farrell\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions. Arellano, Breed\u2019s campaign spokesperson, said in a statement that the mayor had led \u201cthe biggest anti-corruption clean-up in our city\u2019s history\u201d and that \u201cnearly all the recent examples in the news were identified because of the process she initiated to root out waste, fraud and abuse\u201d. Breed had acted swiftly in response to the news about the \u201cunfortunate events\u201d at the Dream Keepers Initiative, including asking the director to resign, and \u201cremains committed to the program\u201d, he said. In the wake of the investigation into Farrell and the Dream Keepers Initiative, the Chronicle\u2019s editorial board announced that though Breed was a \u201csafe choice\u201d for mayor, it was endorsing Lurie as someone who could bring much-needed change to the city government. The Chronicle\u2019s endorsement was blunt: \u201cIs Lurie\u2019s inexperience concerning? Absolutely \u2026 We won\u2019t sugarcoat the reality that supporting Lurie is a risk.\u201d Though Lurie\u2019s plans offered \u201ca welcome balance of compassion and toughness\u201d, some of his promises for addressing the homelessness crisis were \u201chyperbolic\u201d or even, frankly, \u201ca fantasy\u201d, the paper noted. But the Chronicle argued that Lurie\u2019s measured demeanour and extensive, if \u201cunearned\u201d, family connections, would likely enable him to hire and manage an impressive staff of city employees, who might be able to do a better job on day-to-day governance issues than Breed had done. Lurie has been running a \u201cvery outsider, populist campaign\u201d, arguing that his lack of experience in city hall \u201cis a good thing, from his point of view\u201d, McDaniel, the political scientist, said. That kind of message, from a \u201cvery rich person\u201d who has spent more on his own campaign than all the other candidates combined, is not one that McDaniel expected would resonate with San Francisco voters. But, he said, Lurie \u201chas done better than I thought, and he could still win\u201d. San Franciscans will use a ranked-choice voting process to select a mayor in November, meaning that candidates can pick up second and third-choice votes in the race from supporters of other candidates. Voters who support Peskin, the underdog progressive candidate, will probably be one of the key second choice vote swing groups. So far, influential local progressives have divided on who to endorse as their second choice, with some choosing Lurie, and others, Breed, McBride, the politics professor, said. \u201cIt\u2019s all just messy,\u201d she said. The Chronicle\u2019s latest poll, from mid-October, showed Lurie surging to first place. Breed\u2019s spokesperson accused Lurie and his family of trying to \u201cbuy the election\u201d, and said: \u201cLurie would be at 1% if he wasn\u2019t spending an unprecedented amount of money to cover up the fact that he has no experience to be mayor.\u201d A spokesperson for Lurie\u2019s campaign responded that Breed and Farrell also had billionaire backers: \u201cTheir attempts to cry foul about a resource disadvantage are the result of bad strategy and tactical blunders \u2013 not an actual lack of resources.\u201d Jaye, the longtime Democratic consultant, said that he believed that some of the city\u2019s ascendant tech donors are \u201cwell-meaning, but arrogant and naive\u201d. \u201cThey are telling themselves because they are successful in technology that they know a lot about government or crime or housing or homelessness.\u201d Their involvement has sometimes turned up the temperature of the campaign, with inflammatory late night tweets upping the ante. Elon Musk, whose political donations are playing an outsized role in the presidential race, has repeatedly tweeted that progressive city officials in San Francisco should be put in prison. Garry Tan, the CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator and a prominent political donor, sparked a police investigation after he tweeted the names of seven city supervisors, including Peskin, saying they should \u201cdie slow motherfuckers\u201d. Local tech leaders have also been working for years to \u201cremake\u201d the city \u201cso it\u2019s their San Francisco, not the San Francisco of the people who live here now\u201d, Jaye argued. While Musk announced this summer that he would be moving the headquarters of X, his struggling social media platform, out of San Francisco, new, more ascendant tech startups are moving in. OpenAI, a major player in artificial intelligence, reportedly leased a second office space in San Francisco in September, part of a reported boom in AI businesses renting office space in the city. You have to \u201cfollow the money\u201d, Jaye said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably five times more than has ever been spent in an election cycle in San Francisco, and we\u2019re not done.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Within weeks of taking the helm at the Treasury, Rachel Reeves began shelving major infrastructure projects. The termination of a road tunnel planned to run next to Stonehenge was quickly followed by the axing of an \u00a3800m donation towards Edinburgh university\u2019s planned supercomputer. A more upbeat chancellor is expected to stand at the dispatch box on 30 October to promote a budget packed with initiatives to drag the economy out of the doldrums. Reeves will say the UK needs rail, water and energy schemes to support a growing economy and the move to net zero, all supported by rewriting the fiscal rules that govern how the UK accounts for debt. Here we look at some of the big infrastructure projects that remain in the pipeline. Lower Thames Crossing A tunnel under the Thames east of the Dartford Crossing that would create a relief road for the M25 is at the top of the agenda for National Highways, England\u2019s road-building agency. Officially it has a \u00a39bn price tag, but that was before the recent inflationary surge and without taking into account the cost of measures necessary to win over objectors affected by the long and arduous building programme. The final cost could be more than a third higher. Reeves has asked officials to investigate bringing in private cash on the promise funders will get a slice of the tolls. Like many other projects, it will be handed to the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (Nista), a new arm\u2019s-length body that was created by merging two existing organisations and will oversee the strategy and delivery of major works. HS2 to Euston/extra Birmingham-Manchester rail capacity After the previous government jettisoned the second leg of HS2 from Birmingham to Manchester, northern mayors clubbed together to push for an alternative, described in places as HS2 lite \u2013 another rail line heading north. An extension from the current \u201cend of the line\u201d at Old Oak Common in west London to Euston, where HS2 was originally going to terminate, has also been revived in recent weeks. The idea has gained momentum in recent months and is likely to feature prominently in the budget. Northern Powerhouse Rail A review of NPR puts the final bill at \u00a330.6bn, including connections to Sheffield, Hull and Bradford, which is supposed to get a new station. These add-ons were promised by the previous government and Reeves may ultimately decide they are unaffordable. There is also the longstanding hope that Leeds station, which cannot cope with the current demand, will get an expensive makeover and the government agrees to fund the West Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin\u2019s mass-transit system for the region. The NPR project is expected to survive budget cuts after receiving the green light to spend \u00a354m developing the scheme from Liverpool to Hull in this financial year. Brabin\u2019s scheme could also get the green light, but \u00a38.5bn of additional funding for a second round of city region sustainable transport settlements could be cut back or delayed indefinitely. Railway restoration projects Boris Johnson earmarked \u00a3500m for the Restoring Your Railway programme in the 2019 Tory manifesto, intending to reopen stations and lines closed down by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s. At least three lines have opened or are under construction. Of the 23 schemes that had secured some funding and the 13 being developed further, most are expected to be delayed or abandoned. Reservoirs Thames Water says its plans to build a reservoir near Oxford would generate more than 900 jobs and take advantage of one of the few plots of land in south-east England available for a reservoir, which is needed to cope with climate change. Local campaigners opposed to project say they sympathise with the aim, but counter that its 25-metre walls will be dangerous and that it is the least-effective method of keeping the taps running during a drought. There is no direct subsidy from the Treasury needed for the scheme, but the regulator needs to sanction a rise in water bills to pay for it. With Thames Water in financial trouble, the focus is likely to be on a national scheme to tackle sewage overspills. Schools Schools could have an extra \u00a336,000 each on average to spend on crumbling buildings if the Department for Education (DfE) reallocated last year\u2019s unspent capital budget, according to analysis by the School Cuts coalition. The Treasury gave the DfE a capital departmental expenditure limit of \u00a36.3bn for 2022-23. Despite the National Audit Office and others reporting the desperate state of disrepair of England\u2019s schools, the DfE spent only \u00a35.3bn, leaving \u00a31bn unspent. But Treasury could decide to claw back the money. Schools are likely to be asked to begin bidding again for cash in the new Whitehall spending review. Hospitals West Suffolk hospital in Bury St Edmunds was built in the 1970s. It was one of 40 the previous Conservative government earmarked for a rebuild by 2030, which were paused by Reeves in July. The local Labour MP, Peter Prinsley, is one of many elected in July\u2019s general election on a wafer-thin majority and he is keen to make sure that one of the biggest pieces of crumbling infrastructure in his new constituency is overhauled. He is also a doctor who campaigned for the hospital project to be saved. While he may win the day, many other hospitals can expect to be told they must wait. Low-carbon energy The government has tasked the National Energy System Operator with providing the first blueprint for Great Britain\u2019s infrastructure up to 2050, including plans for more low-carbon electricity projects and a rewiring of Britain\u2019s power grids. The multi-billion-pound buildout of renewable energy is supported by a subsidy auction, which is ultimately paid through energy bills, so it does not affect the central government budget. To connect new renewable projects to the grid, the companies in charge of running Britain\u2019s power lines and electricity grids are expected to invest \u00a322bn in electricity distribution networks between 2023 and 2028 and almost \u00a311bn in high-voltage transmission lines between 2021 and 2026. Again, the investment will be supported by energy bills rather than Treasury handouts.

According to Deadline, Holland is in talks to co-star with Damon in the project, details of which are unknown other than that it is due for release in July 2026. News of the project emerged earlier in October after reports that Nolan had chosen to produce it with Hollywood studio Universal, who had backed his last film, the multi-Oscar-winning Oppenheimer. Nolan had previously remained loyal to Warner Bros, with whom he had worked since his 2002 film Insomnia, but their relationship ended after the studio temporarily abandoned exclusive theatrical distribution during the Covid pandemic. Nolan has cast Damon twice previously, as an astronaut in Interstellar and as the director of the Manhattan Project in Oppenheimer, but the new project would mark the director\u2019s first collaboration with Holland, whose three Spider-Man films have earned $3.9bn at the global box office. Holland recently completed a run in a stage production of Romeo and Juliet opposite Francesca Amewudah-Rivers in London\u2019s West End and is due to shoot a fourth Spider-Man film next year, after reports emerged that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\u2019s Destin Daniel Cretton had been hired as its director.",

      "bodyText": "Some have called Hurricanes Helene and Milton an October surprise. Yet such disasters are now dispiritingly predictable. In their wake, pundits have asked whether and how the storms \u2013 which happened to hit some key swing states \u2013 could impact a presidential election shaping up to be decided by razor-thin margins. There\u2019s practical concerns, like whether some affected voters will physically be able to cast their ballots. And then there\u2019s a political question: Will the fact that the climate crisis, which is exacerbated these hurricanes, raise the importance of that issue? Or will that be counterbalanced by those who have become convinced the government engineered these disasters to suppress electoral power? Believe it or not, the answer could rest on the shoulders of your local weather reporter. Such an unlikely hero went viral earlier this month when John Morales, a venerable meteorologist in Miami, became visibly emotional on air during one of his reports on Milton. His voice choking, he offered an ominous assessment of the hurricane\u2019s strength: \u201cThis is just horrific.\u201d That sincerity and urgency garnered the clip nearly 2m views. The resonance of Morales\u2019s appearance proves that combining deep expertise, hard-earned credibility and a willingness to be vulnerable could provide a roadmap \u2013 or a forecast \u2013 for climate reporting to remain relevant and impactful despite the headwinds. Climate change presents the classic political conundrum of a (literally) glacial catastrophe demanding swift action. To avert the worst effects, the investments required \u2013 from clean energy to flood-proof infrastructure \u2013 would total in the trillions, but voters tend to be wary of making such outlays until the worst has already happened. Polling bears out this \u201cshort-termism.\u201d Americans have gone from climate skeptics to climate curious, with 54% saying they consider it a major threat. And yet when it comes time to rank their top issues heading into election day, the public demurs, placing climate change second to last on their list of priorities. Of course, the repeat champion remains the economy \u2013 never mind that with smart policies, combating the climate crisis could be a lifesaver and a job creator.

There is something a bit old-school deferential about that objection, which ideally I would train myself out of: you wouldn\u2019t give a second glance to a great big pile that had been built by an authentic aristo, back in the days when nobility meant something, so to object to ostentation just because it\u2019s new is another way of objecting to new money. The second guy objected to the Mendip stone; I can\u2019t remember whether he thought she had used too much of it or not enough. Again, I figured, she is the expert; she will have thought of a way to charm her neighbours. Anyway, it turns out she did some building work without planning permission, including adding an extension to a 50-year\u2011old farmhouse that, in her original plans, was slated to be demolished, as well as the aforementioned treehouse, boathouse and greenhouse. Her retrospective application for permission for this work was denied and the council may well ask her to knock it all down (she is appealing the decision). It looks as though she didn\u2019t just start building before she had applied; she probably inked the TV contract beforehand. This is a level of chutzpah far beyond \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d \u2013 she was hiding on primetime telly. Anyway, I still like her. I can see that is naughty, but I still wish her well.",

After Blake killed Kaba, the police officer faced threats. A source close to Blake told the Guardian that during the Old Bailey trial the threat to him remained severe. Blake was named only after a legal challenge by media organisations, and his picture cannot be published because of a court order. The family of Kaba had sought to extend reporting restrictions relating to his criminal past pending the end of all legal proceedings. But police, in a statement to the court, argued publication of details about his character could quell any potential unrest. The Met police deputy assistant commissioner Stuart Cundy said in a statement: \u201cIt is the Metropolitan police\u2019s assessment that the open and transparent disclosure of Mr Kaba\u2019s character at the conclusion of the \u2026 trial will significantly reduce the risk of unrest on London\u2019s streets and help keep the public safe.\u201d Cundy said planned protests about the acquittal would be largely peaceful but some people could try to commit violence. He said that in the London borough of Lambeth, where the 67 gang is based and where Kaba was shot, trust in police among the black community was low. Cundy said there was a danger of giving the local community a \u201cmisleading impression\u201d about who Kaba was and that \u201cthere would be the clear potential for emotions to tip into disorder\u201d. Deborah Coles, director of INQUEST, which supported Kaba\u2019s family, said: \u201cThese are familiar state tactics that demonise the deceased to reflect from the stark reality of the shooting dead of an unarmed black man whose identity they did not know. \u201cPolice do not have a license to kill, and should not be judge, jury and executioner. Rather than trying to legitimise Chris\u2019s killing, the police should focus on ensuring that these killings end.\u201d",

The bird had been stuck inside the Coles supermarket in Campbelltown for almost a month, according to the Sydney Metropolitan Wildlife Services. On Tuesday morning, another cockatoo, Old Lady Doris, was taken into the supermarket by the Feathered Friends bird rescue director Ravi Wasan in the hope Mickey would be reassured by her presence. The plan looked like it could work, with Mickey initially flying down, before being spooked and retreating out of reach. \u201cHe\u2019s really scared because there\u2019s been so many attempts \u2013 people trying to catch him,\u201d Wasan said. \u201cHe\u2019s so scared but the other cockatoo, obviously, is so loving that it really reassured him.

Why?

Consequently, the orders given to the defence establishment also haven\u2019t changed.\u201d On Hamas\u2019s side, too, there was no shift, the negotiator said.</p> <p>Similar Israeli intransigence is evident in Lebanon, where airstrikes on Beirut and other cities, and territorial advances, have intensified since the killing of Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah. On Monday Israeli forces extended their strikes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan\">to non-military targets</a>.</p> <p>In a sign of his contempt for the peacemakers, Netanyahu has shown no compunction about taking his war to the UN, both politically \u2013 last month he delivered a shamefully offensive, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/israel-pm-remarks-un-ga-79-27sep24/\">bellicose speech</a> to the general assembly \u2013 and militarily, through <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9j74z7xvmo\">attacks on Unifil</a>, the UN force in Lebanon.

There is talk of creating a new international force to secure the Israel-Lebanon border. Meanwhile Israel is said to be demanding a future right to re-intervene in the country, on the ground and in the air, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-truce-demands-said-to-include-access-to-lebanese-airspace-to-disarm-hezbollah/\">whenever it feels threatened</a>.</p> <p>These latter demands are unacceptable to any sovereign state, however enfeebled. But they reflect the Israeli leader\u2019s overall approach. As in Gaza, so in Lebanon. Netanyahu, knowing he cannot resist international pressure indefinitely, appears intent on doing as much damage to Hezbollah, militarily and organisationally, as he possibly can, while he can, and gaining as much ground, pending an end to hostilities on favourable terms, preferably dictated by him.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible not to feel sorry for Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state. In pursuit of Biden\u2019s delusional belief that Sinwar\u2019s killing is an opportunity, and not another milestone on the road to hell, Blinken has been ordered to undertake yet another round of what the Americans amusingly call Middle East peacemaking this week. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/22/middle-east-crisis-live-blog-news-updates-israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-palestine-hamas-hezbollah-war\">arrived in Tel Aviv today</a> as air raid sirens sounded, with Hezbollah claiming to have bombed the city.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-intensifies-offensive-gaza-lebanon-after-hamas-leaders-death-2024-10-20/\">Blinken carries no sticks, only carrots</a> \u2013 and Netanyahu is a carnivore. For Netanyahu, talks with Blinken mean listening to what he has to say, agreeing it\u2019s a good idea, then carrying on regardless as soon as his visitor\u2019s back is turned.</p> <p>Number one reality check: the main focus of Blinken\u2019s trip is not Gaza or even Lebanon. It\u2019s about limiting the targets, destructive power and escalatory, possibly nuclear-related madness of <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-complains-to-un-watchdog-alleging-israeli-threats-to-hit-its-nuclear-sites/\">Israel\u2019s imminent retaliatory strike against Iran</a> \u2013 following Tehran\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/west-defend-israel-iranian-attack\">181 ballistic missile attack</a> earlier this month. Number two reality check: Blinken and Netanyahu both know that Biden will not seriously try to rein in Israel before the 5 November US election. There will be no arms cut-off, no punitive sanctions that could lose votes for Democrats.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s biggest fear right now is an explosive, out-of-control confrontation between Iran and Israel, this week or next, that sucks US forces into another Middle East quagmire just before voters choose between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The US election is Netanyahu\u2019s true horizon. This is what he\u2019s looking towards. This is why, unchecked, he will continue to do whatever he likes, and more so, in both Gaza and Lebanon for the next two weeks at least.</p> <p>If Harris wins, the US may be better placed to impose terms, given that Harris ostensibly feels strongly about the humanitarian cost of the war \u2013 though doing so will require the political will that is currently lacking. If victory goes to Trump, a likeminded hard-right, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-06-12/biden-trump-on-israel-palestinians-middle-east\">anti-Palestinian hawk</a>, Netanyahu will be able to cash in his chips when he chooses, insisting from his current position of strength on the timing, terms and shape of any truces and subsequent longer-term settlement.</p> <p>This is what Netanyahu is thinking, this is why he will not contemplate a ceasefire now. Except neither he nor anyone else knows what Iran will do if it is attacked on the alarming scale implied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/20/leaked-documents-allege-israel-plans-attack-iran\">by leaked US briefing papers</a>. Netanyahu the brutal, reckless chancer is taking his visceral, endless brinkmanship too far.

Biden\u2019s biggest fear right now is an explosive, out-of-control confrontation between Iran and Israel, this week or next, that sucks US forces into another Middle East quagmire just before voters choose between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The US election is Netanyahu\u2019s true horizon. This is what he\u2019s looking towards. This is why, unchecked, he will continue to do whatever he likes, and more so, in both Gaza and Lebanon for the next two weeks at least. If Harris wins, the US may be better placed to impose terms, given that Harris ostensibly feels strongly about the humanitarian cost of the war \u2013 though doing so will require the political will that is currently lacking. If victory goes to Trump, a likeminded hard-right, anti-Palestinian hawk, Netanyahu will be able to cash in his chips when he chooses, insisting from his current position of strength on the timing, terms and shape of any truces and subsequent longer-term settlement. This is what Netanyahu is thinking, this is why he will not contemplate a ceasefire now. Except neither he nor anyone else knows what Iran will do if it is attacked on the alarming scale implied by leaked US briefing papers. Netanyahu the brutal, reckless chancer is taking his visceral, endless brinkmanship too far. In the coming days, his murderous game may finally blow up in his and Israel\u2019s face.

And there\u2019s that lovely Pavane too \u2026\u201d This is the typical reply to the question: \u201cDo you like the music of Gabriel Faur\u00e9?\u201d But it\u2019s about as satisfactory a response as would be, to a similar question about Beethoven: \u201cOh yes! There\u2019s that great symphony \u2013 the one that goes da-da-da DAA.\u201d</p> <p>Glorious though <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xZbnY5jQSk\">Faur\u00e9\u2019s Requiem</a> and Pavane are (along with his other best-known works, such as the first violin sonata and first piano quartet), there are whole other worlds to his music that deserve to be far better known. Luckily, 2024 marks the centenary of Faur\u00e9\u2019s death, which gives us Faur\u00e9ans a wonderful opportunity to share with audiences his lesser-known masterpieces.</p> <p>Gabriel Urbain Faur\u00e9 was born on 12 May 1845 in the village of Pamiers, in south-western France. A lonely childhood was largely spent playing alone in a beautiful meadow outside his house; in the middle of this meadow was a chapel. Elements of both these features \u2013 the beauties of nature, and the peace and tranquillity of worship \u2013 were to become crucial aspects of Faur\u00e9\u2019s music.</p>    <p>Sent to the Niedermeyer school \u2013 an institution specialising in early church music \u2013 at the age of nine, the boy\u2019s musical education was entrusted to a brilliant if irascible young man with a huge nose, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/02/saint-saens-proms-unfashionable-underrated-and-overdue-for-reappraisal\">Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns</a>. The two became friends for life, Saint-Sa\u00ebns \u2013 whose own two little sons were to die within six weeks of each other \u2013 taking a fatherly role in the life of his younger protege.</p> <p>Growing up, the quietly charming Faur\u00e9 fitted perfectly into the elegant, highly artistic world of the Parisian salons, where many of his works received their first hearings; an observer remembered him \u201cmoving at his ease among the milling crowds, a blissful smile on his face like an Olympian deity\u201d. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/18/where-to-start-with-marcel-proust-french-writer\">Marcel Proust</a>, among countless others, became a devoted fan.) Life was not all roses, though. Faur\u00e9 suffered from acute migraines and bouts of depression. Furthermore, his career as a composer failed to take off to the level it so richly deserved, forcing him for many years to earn his living as a church organist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The simplicity of Faur\u00e9\u2019s music is so great that it can surprise us before it touches and moves us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t until his early 60s that he finally landed a major position, as head of the Paris conservatoire. There the gentle composer astounded everyone by introducing drastic reforms, sweeping away the crusty traditions that had reigned for generations. (As a young boy, I knew an old gentleman who had studied there during Faur\u00e9\u2019s tenure; \u201chis influence was everywhere,\u201d he affirmed.) Alas, by that time another problem was threatening Faur\u00e9\u2019s equilibrium: he was losing his hearing. His deafness was to become profound, with all that that change entails \u2013 particularly for a musician.</p> <p>At least there were compensations in his private life \u2013 albeit with a rather French twist. His marriage, in his late 30s, to Marie Fr\u00e9miet produced two sons, one of whom became a famous biologist, the other a writer. His relationship to Marie, however, seems to have lacked passion \u2013 though the couple remained close until the end of Faur\u00e9\u2019s life, Marie becoming a musical confidante in whom he seems to have had absolute trust \u2013 she would kiss his manuscript paper to bring him luck.</p>    <p>But Faur\u00e9 looked for other outlets for his romantic energies. Among his lovers, for some years, was Emma Bardac, who was later married to Debussy. And for the last 25 years of his life, Faur\u00e9 was in a close relationship with a pianist, Marguerite Hasselmans. She was apparently the finest interpreter of his music; frustratingly, there seem to be no recordings of her playing. On his deathbed in 1924 the composer begged his sons to look after Marguerite, who despite the very public nature of their relationship, was officially invisible. Thankfully, the two men did just that.</p> <p>So to the music: what is so special about Faur\u00e9? How can one explain the unique magic of his art? And why is much of his music, if not his name, so little known, compared with that of his younger compatriots Debussy and Ravel (the latter a student of Faur\u00e9\u2019s)?</p> <p>It\u2019s a tricky question. Despite his innate modesty, Faur\u00e9 knew his own worth. In a cross letter to the pianist Alfred Cortot (a great musician, but an opportunistic careerist), chiding him for performing so much of Debussy and Ravel\u2019s music while neglecting his, Faur\u00e9 inquired of Cortot why he was \u201cmore modest on my behalf than I am myself?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The quiet shock of his extreme harmonies still has the power to make us gasp</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the reason lies at least partly in Faur\u00e9\u2019s dislike of self-aggrandising display, and the immense subtlety of his nature, both personal and musical. (\u201cI\u2019m not in the habit of attracting crowds\u201d, as he told a friend.) Whereas Debussy and Ravel \u2013 like so many of their Parisian contemporaries across all the arts \u2013 proclaimed their originality in no uncertain terms, producing works with extra-musical, visually or nationally oriented titles that were arresting in themselves (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=levGISzDmjs\">La Cath\u00e9drale Engloutie</a>, <a href=\"https://interlude.hk/le-gibet/\">Le Gibet</a>), Faur\u00e9\u2019s extraordinary originality was almost entirely contained within outwardly traditional forms. As the perceptive critic \u00c9mile Vuillermoz (1878-1960) put it: \u201cTo love and understand Faur\u00e9, one must at all costs have a musical nature. Faur\u00e9 is pure music \u2026 It is no good bringing anything in the way of painter\u2019s or sculptor\u2019s gifts to listen to him \u2026 Under its apparent classicism, [Faur\u00e9\u2019s music] contains the most magnificently revolutionary audacities.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s so right. Particularly in his later works \u2013 in which Faur\u00e9, like Beethoven before him, having been deprived of the outer world of sound, created his own, ecstatically radiant aural universe \u2013 the quiet shock of his extreme harmonies still has the power to make us gasp. As with Beethoven, the creations of his last period contain even deeper subtleties than the (perhaps) more outwardly attractive earlier works. And also corresponding to the older German master (whom Faur\u00e9, unlike many of the French composers of his time, revered), Faur\u00e9\u2019s music, despite his increasingly poor health never strays anywhere near self-pity or depression. His avowed intention was to show through his music a reality better than our own \u2013 and how he succeeds. There is a joy, an energy, a luminous quality to his output that is unique.</p> <p>Faur\u00e9\u2019s music uplifts \u2013 and moves us deeply. The French musicologist and Faur\u00e9\u2019s contemporary Joseph de Marliave expresses it well when he wrote that the simplicity of Faur\u00e9\u2019s music \u201cis so great that it can surprise us before it touches and moves us\u201d. Absolutely true: often in rehearsals I have found that it is the seemingly artless touches \u2013 some unassuming passing notes in the slow movement of the second piano quintet, for instance, or the unadorned rising scale that forms the second main theme of the string quartet (his last work) \u2013 that suddenly bring tears to the eyes.</p> <p>Since being introduced as a child to his music Faur\u00e9 has been an important presence in my life. In fact, he has been something of a benevolent if absent godfather, playing a surprisingly big role in many of the important relationships in my life \u2013 it\u2019s no coincidence that my son is named Gabriel. The current festival at London\u2019s Wigmore Hall gives me a rare and precious opportunity to play his entire chamber music output with musician-friends for whom Faur\u00e9 is a similarly central figure. It is our way of offering thanks for all the blessings he has bestowed on us.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Beyond the Requiem: Steven Isserlis\u2019s five favourite Faur\u00e9 works</strong><br><br><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB_3rG7KZyU\">Cantique de Racine</a></strong> Faur\u00e9 was still a teenager \u2013 still at school, in fact \u2013 when he wrote this meltingly beautiful choral song.<br><strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/7fMkf5agFuRWCp4ZwI0Ymy?si=vIGShOByQruLQ13CDeZjGA\">Theme and variations for piano, op 73</a></strong> Faur\u00e9\u2019s only \u201cofficial\u201d set of variations, this is a winner.<br><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n82LgO42Lhg\">Clair de Lune</a></strong>,<strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVXm6kFtSXM\">Mandoline</a></strong> There are so many glorious Faur\u00e9 songs that it\u2019s impossible to pick just one; I find these two especially touching.<br><strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/0kCcFFgon7VSIeDsAW6YGm?si=597deafeb06c4fd9\">Piano trio op 120</a></strong> If I had to choose one piece by Faur\u00e9 \u2013 thank God I don\u2019t \u2013 this would have to be it.

Now 49, Akari was told the myth of Kamukuwak\u00e1, the first Wauja chief, during visits to the cave as a child with his father and uncles. It was there, tracing the engravings representing female fertility, as well as fish, dragonflies and other forest creatures, that he learned about his people\u2019s history, and the skills and knowledge required of a cacique and traditional singer.

      "body": "<p>Care work, Kathryn Faulke thought as she scoured job adverts, \u201cis a rubbish job. They\u2019re not going to turn me down.\u201d She had, after all, been a senior dietitian and worked for several years in the NHS \u2013 a career that had left her with anxiety and burnout. \u201cI saw an advert and it said \u2018in exchange for compassion and reliability \u2026\u2019 and I thought that sounded welcoming.\u201d But the truth is, she says: \u201cI just didn\u2019t think I was good enough for anything&nbsp;else.\u201d</p> <p>In care work, she found the drudgery, exhaustion and low pay she was expecting, but also so much more. \u201cI was blown away by how interesting and meaningful it was,\u201d says Faulke. \u201cAnd how it made me feel.\u201d The brilliant book she has written about her experience, Every Kind of People, is, she says, \u201calmost like a love story to care. I wasn\u2019t expecting it.\u201d She didn\u2019t want it to be a \u201cworthy\u201d book. \u201cI just want people to see the&nbsp;joy in it.\u201d</p> <p>There is certainly joy. Most of Faulke\u2019s colleagues are a welcome reminder that there are wonderful human beings in the world, and the people she calls her \u201ccustomers\u201d are delightful. Stevie is difficult, but with a sharp sense of humour; Mrs Rose is lovely and sings to her on her visits. When Faulke, faint after not having time to eat all day, collapses at the bottom of the Roses\u2019 stairs, Mr Rose steps in to look after her. Mr Radbert, who has survived a stroke, is bawdy and outrageous. \u201cHe\u2019s got everything against him, battling at every front, and it doesn\u2019t matter, he\u2019s got this fantastic sense of humour and spirit that just carries you along. You think things are unbearable, but people bear them, and they still find joy.\u201d She talks to her customers about their younger lives, asks what their earliest memories are, finds out who they are.</p> <p>One of her favourites is William,<strong> </strong>who is so old that his children are elderly and find it difficult to visit. (William makes a touching and hilarious, if racy, confession from his youth, which is revealed in the memoir.) \u201cHe\u2019s just a case in point; we had a real connection,\u201d says Faulke. She discovered he used to love gardening, and started taking him from his tower block to the park to look at the flowerbeds. When the lift broke down, she planted geraniums on his balcony. \u201cIt really made me aware of how wonderful flowers are, and it was a gift to me, because he made me stop and look at things that I\u2019d never noticed before. Just ordinary things \u2013 making a cup of tea, having a chat, swapping ghost stories, silly things, but that\u2019s what life\u2019s about, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s about the joy that you find in the small things, and he really taught me that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One client gave her a necklace \u2018to keep you safe the way you keep me safe\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If all this makes Faulke sound like a saint \u2013 and I think she is one \u2013 her book also stresses how physically hard the job is \u2013 and how relentless. She admits to feeling a pang of relief whenever visits are cancelled at the last minute, meaning she will still be paid for them. She doesn\u2019t romanticise care work \u2013 it\u2019s hard to think of it as anything other than messy and human when she is mopping up blood like \u201ca crime scene\u201d or trying not to slip as she empties bowls of urine. But the way she writes does makes the job sound absolutely meaningful.</p> <p>Faulke \u2013 at the start of her caring career, living in London with her husband, after their children had grown up \u2013 had been a hospital dietitian for about 10 years, a job she had loved in the beginning but that had became too stressful, with rushed clinics and no time. Crippling anxiety had seeped in, too, and she was \u201cterrified\u201d of making mistakes with vulnerable patients. Helping one woman through pregnancy, she became convinced she had prescribed too many supplements and that the baby would be harmed. \u201cIt was ludicrous. She had a beautiful baby, everyone was like: \u2018That\u2019s a great outcome,\u2019 and I&nbsp;was thinking: thank&nbsp;God I didn\u2019t do any damage. I&nbsp;just couldn\u2019t live like it. I was really frightened.\u201d</p> <p>At least with care work, she thought, she wouldn\u2019t be endlessly worrying about people after she had clocked off \u2013 but she was wrong. One of her first visits was to&nbsp;Eddie, \u201cthis old man in this block of flats, alone, with Parkinson\u2019s disease and experiencing hallucinations. He was just such a lovely man and I remember it mattered to me that he had a bit of companionship, and I really did look forward to going back to see him again.\u201d That night, thinking about him, she knew she would become attached to people. \u201cI&nbsp;have&nbsp;to say that\u2019s good, even though I&nbsp;didn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in a London hotel and it\u2019s instantly obvious why Faulke is a good care worker \u2013 she is cheerful and kind and seems very calm, even though she says she is nervous. I notice she is wearing a silver necklace that she describes in&nbsp;the book, given to her by one of her customers (the cross on it was \u201cto keep you safe\u201d, her customer told her, \u201cthe way you keep me safe\u201d). Faulke has always written&nbsp;\u2013 she is writing about nature in nursing homes \u2013 but, although her book deserves to be a huge success, she says she won\u2019t give up the day job (she is working in a nursing home for people living with dementia in Norfolk, where she lives). \u201cIt grounds me, gives me&nbsp;joy. It\u2019s completely pure. I\u2019m just looking after people.\u201d</p> <p>Every Kind of People came out of short scenes Faulke shared with a writing class she was attending. Someone told her it could be a book, so when she saw that the women\u2019s writing magazine had launched a memoir competition, she entered \u2013 and won. She must have worried about the ethics of writing about vulnerable people, even if she did disguise their identities. She did, she says, but when she talked to them about it, they were all keen. During the pandemic, \u201cMrs Rose said: \u2018Please write about us, because we\u2019re forgotten.\u2019\u201d Another elderly customer, Margaret, \u201cused to get very frightened, saying: \u2018They don\u2019t&nbsp;care if I die.\u2019 So I felt much better about writing.\u201d</p> <p>When she started working in care, she says she was \u201cterrified and intrigued in equal measure\u201d. She remembers a feeling of anxiety rising before each front door, wondering what she would have to deal with once she was inside. \u201cBut it\u2019s surprising how easy it is to get used to. I found being with people in their own homes really interesting. They were all so different and fascinating, but you had to engage with them to reach that point.\u201d</p> <p>Some people were clear that she was there to do a job and not to become too friendly. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, but, for most people, I think that connection is really welcome. You don\u2019t want to overstep the line, but you\u2019re dealing often with people who are incredibly isolated.\u201d She would envy the care workers who were good at it. \u201cI&nbsp;really wanted to be like that. They were so relaxed with people, they would crack jokes, and you could see how much they lightened people\u2019s days and how much people loved them.\u201d</p>    <p>The need for companionship is something she has felt herself, since moving to Norfolk (\u201cmy marriage did not survive the pandemic\u201d). \u201cI thought I\u2019d love living alone by the sea and I wouldn\u2019t particularly need lots of people around me, but I do miss companionship. But then you\u2019re thinking about someone like Bridget, who spends her life on the third floor of her council block with no visitors at all. When you are someone like William, you can\u2019t see, you can\u2019t hear, you can\u2019t read, it\u2019s quite difficult to listen to the television or a radio. Early on, I thought: what must it be like to have no one ever touch you, no&nbsp;one&nbsp;ever hold your hand? I think it\u2019s terribly important.\u201d</p> <p>Faulke describes what a typical day as a care worker, perhaps a working weekend, would look like: she would leave her house at 7am and cycle to Margaret. \u201cLet myself in, gently wake her, get her through washing and dressing and get her into a chair, make sure she\u2019s got everything she needs.\u201d To get someone ready for the day would take 45 minutes to an hour. \u201cIf it\u2019s straightforward, that\u2019s fine. If&nbsp;it\u2019s not, it can be a real difficulty.\u201d Maybe someone\u2019s body simply isn\u2019t&nbsp;able to move as quickly as they\u2019d like.</p> <p>Faulke would cycle to help another two or three people out of bed until late morning, when she would visit those who were \u201cmore dependent\u201d, who needed medication, help going to the loo or having their incontinence pads changed. Then she made lunchtime visits, all involving between 10 and 20 minutes to get to each customer. On a bike, it was fairly easy, but for care workers who rely on public transport, it can be impossible: \u201cYou\u2019re not paid for those times, although I&nbsp;think that people are beginning to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/09/nearly-half-of-england-care-workers-get-less-than-real-living-wage-study\">paid for travel time</a>.\u201d In the evening, she would begin to help people get to bed and finish at about 9pm. \u201cMy shortest slot was half an hour, but I know that some shortest slots in other companies are 15 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>It can be slow, frustrating work and it requires endless patience. \u201cThat\u2019s why talking to people is the thing that makes it magical,\u201d she says. On the days when she didn\u2019t have to rush, Faulke would take her time, and sit with her customers, although she wouldn\u2019t be paid: \u201cIf I\u2019ve got nothing on for an hour, sitting with William having a cup of tea instead of going out into the rain is really nice.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, her visits overran because something had gone wrong&nbsp;\u2013 somebody was in a bad state, for instance, or equipment was broken \u2013 in which case she would be paid extra. She remembers getting to one customer and finding that the hoist was broken. \u201cThat makes a really difficult morning. It\u2019s going to be awful \u2013 and the stress of getting a big guy washed and dressed on a bed on your own is really hard; \u00a35 extra doesn\u2019t seem like much&nbsp;compensation.\u201d</p> <p>The average pay for a home care worker is \u00a312 an hour. \u201cAt the moment, I work in a place where the pay is quite good. I could complain, but nobody gets paid much at the moment, do they?\u201d Don\u2019t they? Lots of people seem to earn a fortune, doing jobs that don\u2019t seem to bring much benefit to people. Faulke smiles. \u201cYeah, that rankles. There\u2019s something about the idea of leaving a person in charge of someone who\u2019s very vulnerable; that seems to be such a&nbsp;big responsibility and such a big risk to pay a pittance for. It doesn\u2019t seem equal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not even just about money. I\u2019d like the government to see us as professionals, not as dogsbodies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although moving to care work meant she suddenly couldn\u2019t afford the things she would have bought in the past without really thinking about it, she felt luckier than many care workers. She had a husband with a salary and they had a house. \u201cI knew carers who were living on sofas,\u201d she says. It\u2019s hard to lobby for change \u2013 although there have been care workers\u2019 strikes this year \u2013 because for many, she says: \u201cIt takes time and energy, and you don\u2019t have those things.\u201d She would obviously like higher rates of pay, but \u201cit\u2019s not even just about money. I\u2019d like [the government] to see us as professionals, not as dogsbodies.\u201d Unless we value care workers, she says, people won\u2019t be attracted to it as a profession and we won\u2019t get good care workers.</p> <p>Caring for someone vulnerable requires skill, and workers are often at the frontline, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s the consultant who passes the case to the GP, who passes the case to the district nurse, who passes the case to our manager, who passes the case to us, and everyone else can walk away from this situation knowing that someone else is dealing with it, except for us.\u201d There have been days, she says, when \u201cit\u2019s been dreadful. The pandemic was dreadful \u2013 having people die, and also colleagues die, and having people go into nursing homes and you couldn\u2019t see them.\u201d Never taking a day off, she would cycle to her customers, terrified in their homes, past people in parks, enjoying their well-paid furloughs, and feeling bitter about the poor way the government had treated care workers.</p> <p>Her work has made her think more about becoming old or ill. \u201cI&nbsp;look after myself a lot, because I don\u2019t want to become isolated and immobile. But if I did, I would be looking for good care workers with whom I could have a relationship.\u201d</p> <p>What does she think makes for a&nbsp;good older age? \u201cI think the Roses had a lovely relationship, and they were very positive people. They had good relationships with their care workers and Mrs Rose had a massive element of control. I think William, on the other hand, was very isolated, very lonely. Having love around you is very important, and I think having control over things is really important. You can still have control if you\u2019re immobile in a bed, so long as people&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;it.\u201d</p> <p>Her job has given her a new confidence in herself. \u201cI&nbsp;don\u2019t think I\u2019m afraid of getting old any more, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m afraid of not having done all the things I want to do. I have wonderful things all around me and I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d It taught her to slow down \u2013 because you can\u2019t rush people who can\u2019t move any faster&nbsp;\u2013 and to notice things. \u201cI used to go through things at top speed. I still sometimes do, but I really notice small things now \u2013 the sea in the morning, what people are reading, what they\u2019re looking at, conversations between people. I&nbsp;appreciate things like when you\u2019re well and you can move. I have to really be in the moment now and understand that this is a really lovely time of my life, and not let it&nbsp;go by without noticing it.\u201d</p> <p>What comes through most in the book is the privilege of intimacy that comes from caring, the close relationships and love. \u201cIt goes both ways,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about giving \u2013 you get something back from it that\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Every Kind of People by Kathryn Faulke is published on 24 October (Fig Tree, \u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "Care work, Kathryn Faulke thought as she scoured job adverts, \u201cis a rubbish job. They\u2019re not going to turn me down.\u201d She had, after all, been a senior dietitian and worked for several years in the NHS \u2013 a career that had left her with anxiety and burnout. \u201cI saw an advert and it said \u2018in exchange for compassion and reliability \u2026\u2019 and I thought that sounded welcoming.\u201d But the truth is, she says: \u201cI just didn\u2019t think I was good enough for anything else.\u201d In care work, she found the drudgery, exhaustion and low pay she was expecting, but also so much more. \u201cI was blown away by how interesting and meaningful it was,\u201d says Faulke. \u201cAnd how it made me feel.\u201d The brilliant book she has written about her experience, Every Kind of People, is, she says, \u201calmost like a love story to care. I wasn\u2019t expecting it.\u201d She didn\u2019t want it to be a \u201cworthy\u201d book. \u201cI just want people to see the joy in it.\u201d There is certainly joy. Most of Faulke\u2019s colleagues are a welcome reminder that there are wonderful human beings in the world, and the people she calls her \u201ccustomers\u201d are delightful. Stevie is difficult, but with a sharp sense of humour; Mrs Rose is lovely and sings to her on her visits. When Faulke, faint after not having time to eat all day, collapses at the bottom of the Roses\u2019 stairs, Mr Rose steps in to look after her. Mr Radbert, who has survived a stroke, is bawdy and outrageous. \u201cHe\u2019s got everything against him, battling at every front, and it doesn\u2019t matter, he\u2019s got this fantastic sense of humour and spirit that just carries you along. You think things are unbearable, but people bear them, and they still find joy.\u201d She talks to her customers about their younger lives, asks what their earliest memories are, finds out who they are. One of her favourites is William, who is so old that his children are elderly and find it difficult to visit. (William makes a touching and hilarious, if racy, confession from his youth, which is revealed in the memoir.) \u201cHe\u2019s just a case in point; we had a real connection,\u201d says Faulke. She discovered he used to love gardening, and started taking him from his tower block to the park to look at the flowerbeds. When the lift broke down, she planted geraniums on his balcony. \u201cIt really made me aware of how wonderful flowers are, and it was a gift to me, because he made me stop and look at things that I\u2019d never noticed before. Just ordinary things \u2013 making a cup of tea, having a chat, swapping ghost stories, silly things, but that\u2019s what life\u2019s about, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s about the joy that you find in the small things, and he really taught me that.\u201d If all this makes Faulke sound like a saint \u2013 and I think she is one \u2013 her book also stresses how physically hard the job is \u2013 and how relentless. She admits to feeling a pang of relief whenever visits are cancelled at the last minute, meaning she will still be paid for them. She doesn\u2019t romanticise care work \u2013 it\u2019s hard to think of it as anything other than messy and human when she is mopping up blood like \u201ca crime scene\u201d or trying not to slip as she empties bowls of urine. But the way she writes does makes the job sound absolutely meaningful. Faulke \u2013 at the start of her caring career, living in London with her husband, after their children had grown up \u2013 had been a hospital dietitian for about 10 years, a job she had loved in the beginning but that had became too stressful, with rushed clinics and no time. Crippling anxiety had seeped in, too, and she was \u201cterrified\u201d of making mistakes with vulnerable patients. Helping one woman through pregnancy, she became convinced she had prescribed too many supplements and that the baby would be harmed. \u201cIt was ludicrous. She had a beautiful baby, everyone was like: \u2018That\u2019s a great outcome,\u2019 and I was thinking: thank God I didn\u2019t do any damage. I just couldn\u2019t live like it. I was really frightened.\u201d At least with care work, she thought, she wouldn\u2019t be endlessly worrying about people after she had clocked off \u2013 but she was wrong. One of her first visits was to Eddie, \u201cthis old man in this block of flats, alone, with Parkinson\u2019s disease and experiencing hallucinations. He was just such a lovely man and I remember it mattered to me that he had a bit of companionship, and I really did look forward to going back to see him again.\u201d That night, thinking about him, she knew she would become attached to people. \u201cI have to say that\u2019s good, even though I didn\u2019t want it.\u201d We meet in a London hotel and it\u2019s instantly obvious why Faulke is a good care worker \u2013 she is cheerful and kind and seems very calm, even though she says she is nervous. I notice she is wearing a silver necklace that she describes in the book, given to her by one of her customers (the cross on it was \u201cto keep you safe\u201d, her customer told her, \u201cthe way you keep me safe\u201d). Faulke has always written \u2013 she is writing about nature in nursing homes \u2013 but, although her book deserves to be a huge success, she says she won\u2019t give up the day job (she is working in a nursing home for people living with dementia in Norfolk, where she lives). \u201cIt grounds me, gives me joy. It\u2019s completely pure. I\u2019m just looking after people.\u201d Every Kind of People came out of short scenes Faulke shared with a writing class she was attending. Someone told her it could be a book, so when she saw that the women\u2019s writing magazine had launched a memoir competition, she entered \u2013 and won. She must have worried about the ethics of writing about vulnerable people, even if she did disguise their identities. She did, she says, but when she talked to them about it, they were all keen. During the pandemic, \u201cMrs Rose said: \u2018Please write about us, because we\u2019re forgotten.\u2019\u201d Another elderly customer, Margaret, \u201cused to get very frightened, saying: \u2018They don\u2019t care if I die.\u2019 So I felt much better about writing.\u201d When she started working in care, she says she was \u201cterrified and intrigued in equal measure\u201d. She remembers a feeling of anxiety rising before each front door, wondering what she would have to deal with once she was inside. \u201cBut it\u2019s surprising how easy it is to get used to. I found being with people in their own homes really interesting. They were all so different and fascinating, but you had to engage with them to reach that point.\u201d Some people were clear that she was there to do a job and not to become too friendly. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, but, for most people, I think that connection is really welcome. You don\u2019t want to overstep the line, but you\u2019re dealing often with people who are incredibly isolated.\u201d She would envy the care workers who were good at it. \u201cI really wanted to be like that. They were so relaxed with people, they would crack jokes, and you could see how much they lightened people\u2019s days and how much people loved them.\u201d The need for companionship is something she has felt herself, since moving to Norfolk (\u201cmy marriage did not survive the pandemic\u201d). \u201cI thought I\u2019d love living alone by the sea and I wouldn\u2019t particularly need lots of people around me, but I do miss companionship. But then you\u2019re thinking about someone like Bridget, who spends her life on the third floor of her council block with no visitors at all. When you are someone like William, you can\u2019t see, you can\u2019t hear, you can\u2019t read, it\u2019s quite difficult to listen to the television or a radio. Early on, I thought: what must it be like to have no one ever touch you, no one ever hold your hand? I think it\u2019s terribly important.\u201d Faulke describes what a typical day as a care worker, perhaps a working weekend, would look like: she would leave her house at 7am and cycle to Margaret. \u201cLet myself in, gently wake her, get her through washing and dressing and get her into a chair, make sure she\u2019s got everything she needs.\u201d To get someone ready for the day would take 45 minutes to an hour. \u201cIf it\u2019s straightforward, that\u2019s fine. If it\u2019s not, it can be a real difficulty.\u201d Maybe someone\u2019s body simply isn\u2019t able to move as quickly as they\u2019d like. Faulke would cycle to help another two or three people out of bed until late morning, when she would visit those who were \u201cmore dependent\u201d, who needed medication, help going to the loo or having their incontinence pads changed.

It also follows Bradshaw (Kendrick), an aspiring actor battling industry sexism who sees The Dating Game as a way to get her big break.</p> <p>Their paths cross on the show, a forerunner of <a href=\"https://abc.com/show/294366f4-0130-4c40-97b2-387c154e7eff\">The Bachelor</a> and other reality TV that featured future Hollywood stars such as Farrah Fawcett, Sally Field and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Its producers had no idea about that Alcala was already a registered sex offender and did little by way of vetting contestants.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mattmurphylaw.com/about-matt-murphy-law/\">Matt Murphy</a>, a former homicide prosecutor who worked on the Alcala case and consulted on Woman of the Hour, says by phone from Manhattan Beach, California:<em> </em>\u201cThe Dating Game was a risque G-rated show that ran for over 10 years in southern California.

And it reflected a more innocent time in America, especially when it comes to our collective understanding of sexual predators.\u201d</p> <p>Handsome, intelligent and urbane, Alcala seemed like an ideal contestant. Yet as he sat on stage in a brown bell-bottom suit, he already had blood on his hands. Murphy continues: \u201cIt speaks to the narcissism, the arrogance of psychopaths.

      "body": "<h2>What I\u2019m most looking forward to \u2026</h2> <p>I can\u2019t wait to see <strong>what Anthony Edwards looks like</strong> after his first taste of playoff success and a summer to soak up inspiration from playing alongside his heroes. As the lone No 1 overall pick remaining on the Wolves with the departure of Karl-Anthony Towns, the keys to the franchise are now his. He\u2019s primed for a true breakout season. <strong>CDL</strong></p> <p>LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry\u2019s <strong>attempts to channel Tom Brady</strong>. While the trio are still playing at a high level with no hints of retirement, a new crop of stars are emerging. Similar to Brady\u2019s final seasons with Tampa Bay, LeBron, KD, and Steph will challenge younger NBA stars to prove their reign is over. <strong>AS</strong></p> <p>In the latter half of last season, the NBA seemed to shift from allowing ticky-tack fouls to <strong>letting the players play more physically</strong>. Refs could swallow their whistles. I grew up in the era of 1990s basketball where final scores were sometimes in the 60s. And while we don\u2019t need to go back to that, my hope is that the league will focus more on physical play and stop allowing guys like James Harden to trick refs into 10,000 foul calls per game. <strong>JU</strong></p> <h2>Biggest offseason development \u2026</h2> <p>The splashiest trade this summer was certainly the Towns / Julius Randle swap between New York and Minnesota, but personally I\u2019m most intrigued by the <em>first </em>big trade the Knicks made this summer: <strong>acquiring Mikail Bridges</strong> from neighboring Brooklyn. Bridges is just what the Knicks were missing, and they\u2019re now well positioned to give Boston a run for their money. <strong>CDL</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/18/life-as-an-nba-seven-footer-the-cons-doors-beds-and-a-shortage-of-tall-women\">Life as an NBA seven-footer: \u2018The cons? Doors, beds and a shortage of tall women\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>New hope for the Knicks</strong>. Since 1973, Knicks fans have entered most seasons holding unreasonable expectations of winning the title. This season, that dream could be realized. With Jalen Brunson playing at an All-NBA level, the offseason additions of Bridges and Towns place the Knicks in a prime position to dethrone the Celtics. <strong>AS</strong></p> <p>The splashiest were Paul George to Philly and Towns to New York. And while I\u2019m more interested in the latter than the former there, what the basketball nerd in me is <em>most</em> looking forward to seeing are <strong>the additions in Oklahoma City</strong>. Often, to win a championship means to make the right moves on the margins and the Thunder getting Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein was a coup. <strong>JU</strong></p> <h2>The surprise package will be ...</h2> <p>This has already been discussed too much by diehards to be a \u201csurprise,\u201d but the basketball viewing public has, as a whole, forgotten about the <strong>Memphis Grizzlies</strong>. And that\u2019s a mistake, because Ja Morant is on a revenge tour, GG Jackson had a breakout season, and Dillon Brooks has been replaced by the equally spicy but more mature Marcus Smart. Memphis will be a surefire playoff team. <strong>CDL</strong></p> <p><strong>The Grizzlies and Morant\u2019s return</strong>.

      "bodyText": "What I\u2019m most looking forward to \u2026 I can\u2019t wait to see what Anthony Edwards looks like after his first taste of playoff success and a summer to soak up inspiration from playing alongside his heroes. As the lone No 1 overall pick remaining on the Wolves with the departure of Karl-Anthony Towns, the keys to the franchise are now his. He\u2019s primed for a true breakout season. CDL LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry\u2019s attempts to channel Tom Brady. While the trio are still playing at a high level with no hints of retirement, a new crop of stars are emerging. Similar to Brady\u2019s final seasons with Tampa Bay, LeBron, KD, and Steph will challenge younger NBA stars to prove their reign is over. AS In the latter half of last season, the NBA seemed to shift from allowing ticky-tack fouls to letting the players play more physically. Refs could swallow their whistles. I grew up in the era of 1990s basketball where final scores were sometimes in the 60s. And while we don\u2019t need to go back to that, my hope is that the league will focus more on physical play and stop allowing guys like James Harden to trick refs into 10,000 foul calls per game. JU Biggest offseason development \u2026 The splashiest trade this summer was certainly the Towns / Julius Randle swap between New York and Minnesota, but personally I\u2019m most intrigued by the first big trade the Knicks made this summer: acquiring Mikail Bridges from neighboring Brooklyn. Bridges is just what the Knicks were missing, and they\u2019re now well positioned to give Boston a run for their money. CDL New hope for the Knicks. Since 1973, Knicks fans have entered most seasons holding unreasonable expectations of winning the title. This season, that dream could be realized. With Jalen Brunson playing at an All-NBA level, the offseason additions of Bridges and Towns place the Knicks in a prime position to dethrone the Celtics. AS The splashiest were Paul George to Philly and Towns to New York. And while I\u2019m more interested in the latter than the former there, what the basketball nerd in me is most looking forward to seeing are the additions in Oklahoma City. Often, to win a championship means to make the right moves on the margins and the Thunder getting Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein was a coup. JU The surprise package will be ... This has already been discussed too much by diehards to be a \u201csurprise,\u201d but the basketball viewing public has, as a whole, forgotten about the Memphis Grizzlies. And that\u2019s a mistake, because Ja Morant is on a revenge tour, GG Jackson had a breakout season, and Dillon Brooks has been replaced by the equally spicy but more mature Marcus Smart. Memphis will be a surefire playoff team. CDL The Grizzlies and Morant\u2019s return. It\u2019s easy to forget that before Morant\u2019s off-the-court mishaps and season-ending injury, the Grizzlies were the No 2 team in the West. If Morant returns to top form and steers clear of off-court shenanigans, the Grizzlies have enough to achieve a deep playoff run. AS The Orlando Magic will jump out to something like a 20-5 start and people will begin to wonder if they are a title contender. And while they ultimately will not be, the team will be the darling of the NBA and become one of the most attractive destinations for possibly disgruntled stars like Giannis. JU The LeBron James-Bronny James link-up is ... Really, really cool, but causing a lot of overblown hand-wringing. The younger James will probably spend most (if not all) of his season in the G-League. This amount of hullabaloo over a late second-round pick is outsized. CDL A moment that should be cherished because it may not happen again. The rarity of a father-son duo in the NBA will make it a must-see event the first time it happens in the regular season. But the critics won\u2019t be kind as Bronny endures his rookie learning curve. AS Cute, nice, historic. But ultimately it won\u2019t matter in terms of the ultimate goal. I hope Bronny is good. I hope he gets time to develop. Debating nepotism is pointless in this case: it\u2019s just not that important when it comes to the actual games. Though, if JJ Redick can turn Bronny into a player, that will be impressive. JU One bold prediction \u2026 Denver may be in more trouble than many think.

Underneath the forest\u2019s puzzled face and the ground\u2019s grey bankruptcy lie seeds that have waited years for this, as if to say, Let me breathe again, give me back the sky.",

After the end of the 4th year, the method of depreciation changed to the declining-balance method at the rate of 35% per annum. What is the total depreciation at the end of 10 years? Question 33 (three marks): Wombats can run at a speed of 40 km/h over short distances. At this speed, how many seconds would it take a wombat to run 150 metres? Mathematics Advanced Question 1 (one mark): Consider the function shown. Which of the following could be the equation of this function? A. y = 2x + 3 B. y = 2x - 3 C. y = \u20132x + 3 D. y = -2x - 3 Question 11 (3 marks): The graph of the function g(x) is shown.

We have over 600 deaths in custody that we know about. That does not include babies who\u2019ve died in the system,\u201d Thorpe told the ABC on Tuesday morning.</p> \n<p>So, how do Thorpe\u2019s claims stack up?</p> \n<h2>The crown has \u2018committed heinous crimes\u2019 against First Nations people</h2> \n<p>Thousands of Aboriginal men, women and children were killed by British troops and later by government forces acting on instructions from the crown, in a deliberate effort to eradicate all resistance to colonisation.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/almost-half-the-massacres-of-aboriginal-people-were-by-police-research-finds\">Almost half of all frontier massacres</a> were perpetrated by colonial forces.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/mar/04/massacre-map-australia-the-killing-times-frontier-wars\">The killing times: a massacre map of Australia\u2019s frontier wars</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This finding was made by the first major research project to document frontier violence in Australia, led by the University of Newcastle\u2019s Emeritus professor of history, Prof Lyndall Ryan.</p> \n<p>Prof Ryan and her team\u2019s eight-year study of the colonisation of Australia concluded: \u201cFrom the moment the British invaded Australia in 1788 they encountered active resistance from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander owners and custodians of the lands. In the frontier wars which continued into the 1920s frontier massacres were a defining strategy to contain and eradicate that resistance. As a result thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men, women and children were killed.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Calls for treaty</h2> \n<p>Despite this legacy of frontier conflict, no treaty has ever been negotiated between Aboriginal and Islander nations and the commonwealth.</p> \n<p>Because of this, according to the Human Rights Commission, state institutions and laws, including the national constitution, have developed without any negotiation with First Nations.</p> \n<p>Calls for treaties go back decades. A line is often traced from the 1963 Yirrkala bark petition \u2013 in which Yolngu (the Indigenous people of north-east Arnhem Land) asserted their sovereignty over lands where the federal government had allowed a bauxite mine, all the way to 1988, when the Treaty 88 campaign took off amid <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nlCxz650Yo&amp;ab_channel=DreamscapePublishing\">huge Aboriginal protests </a>against the bicentennial of European settlement.</p> \n<p>In June that year, traditional owners presented <a href=\"https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/barunga-statement\">the Barunga statement</a> to Bob Hawke, who promised there would be a treaty by the end of 1990. That did not occur.</p> \n<p>Activists like Senator Thorpe say that until a treaty is signed there can be no peace or reconciliation between Indigenous people and the crown.</p> \n<h2>Aboriginal child removals</h2> \n<p>Aboriginal children were systematically taken from their families, communities and culture, many never to be returned, under assimilation laws and policies adopted by<strong> </strong>all<strong> </strong>Australian governments until 1970.</p> \n<p>Children were put into institutions, fostered or adopted out to non-Indigenous families. Many suffered harsh, degrading treatment, sexual abuse and were frequently indoctrinated to believe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were inferior, or that their parents were dead or did not want them.</p> \n<p>It is estimated between one in 10 and possibly as many as one in three Indigenous children were removed from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970.</p> \n<p>In 2023 22,328 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were in out-of-home care (OOHC). Indigenous children were <a href=\"https://www.snaicc.org.au/resources/family-matters-report-2023/\">10.5 times more likely</a> to be in OOHC than non-Indigenous children according to data collected by SNAICC, the national advocates for Aboriginal children and families.</p> \n<p>Under the \u201cclosing the gap\u201d agreement, Australian governments have promised to reduce the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in OOHC by 45% by 2031. That target is unlikely to be met. In fact, the federal government\u2019s own data says that nationally <a href=\"https://www.pc.gov.au/closing-the-gap-data/dashboard/se/outcome-area12\">the removal rate of Aboriginal children is actually worsening</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reasons for the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in child protection substantiations are complex,\u201d according to a 2019 report by the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare (AIHW).</p> \n<p>AIHW said the legacy of past policies of forced removal \u2013 known in Australia as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/07/who-are-the-stolen-generations-children-years-and-what-has-happened-to-them\">stolen generations</a>, as well as poverty and generational disadvantage \u2013 were among the underlying causes.</p> \n<h2>Deaths in custody</h2> \n<p>According to the Australian Institute of Criminology\u2019s database, at least 576 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have died in police and prison custody since 1991.</p> \n<p>The National Deaths in Custody Program has monitored Indigenous deaths in prison, police custody and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/indigenous-incarceration\">youth detention</a> since 1980.

      "bodyText": "Independent federal senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s forthright haranguing of King Charles during his visit to the Australian parliament has made global headlines. Reactions have been mixed. Many have criticised Thorpe\u2019s decision to disrupt the event, labelling the 51-year-old\u2019s behaviour as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cgrandstanding\u201d. The federal conservative opposition are considering introducing a censure motion against Thorpe, a Gurnai Gunditjmara and Djab-Wurrung woman, when parliament resumes on 8 November. Others, such the deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, support Thorpe\u2019s views and her right to express them directly to the king. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cIt is a fact that the British committed genocide here. It is a fact that their racist legacy lives on in Australia today and that should absolutely be resisted and confronted,\u201d Faruqi said. As she was removed from the reception in Canberra on Monday, Thorpe shouted several claims about the status of Indigenous people in Australia. \u201cThe truth is, this colony is built on stolen land, stolen wealth and stolen lives,\u201d Thorpe said in a statement immediately afterwards. Thorpe said later that she protested to highlight Australia\u2019s poor record on Indigenous deaths in custody, child removals and the need for a treaty. \u201cWe have 24,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care in 2024: it\u2019s worse than the stolen generation. We have over 600 deaths in custody that we know about. That does not include babies who\u2019ve died in the system,\u201d Thorpe told the ABC on Tuesday morning. So, how do Thorpe\u2019s claims stack up? The crown has \u2018committed heinous crimes\u2019 against First Nations people Thousands of Aboriginal men, women and children were killed by British troops and later by government forces acting on instructions from the crown, in a deliberate effort to eradicate all resistance to colonisation. Almost half of all frontier massacres were perpetrated by colonial forces. This finding was made by the first major research project to document frontier violence in Australia, led by the University of Newcastle\u2019s Emeritus professor of history, Prof Lyndall Ryan. Prof Ryan and her team\u2019s eight-year study of the colonisation of Australia concluded: \u201cFrom the moment the British invaded Australia in 1788 they encountered active resistance from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander owners and custodians of the lands. In the frontier wars which continued into the 1920s frontier massacres were a defining strategy to contain and eradicate that resistance. As a result thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men, women and children were killed.\u201d Calls for treaty Despite this legacy of frontier conflict, no treaty has ever been negotiated between Aboriginal and Islander nations and the commonwealth. Because of this, according to the Human Rights Commission, state institutions and laws, including the national constitution, have developed without any negotiation with First Nations. Calls for treaties go back decades. A line is often traced from the 1963 Yirrkala bark petition \u2013 in which Yolngu (the Indigenous people of north-east Arnhem Land) asserted their sovereignty over lands where the federal government had allowed a bauxite mine, all the way to 1988, when the Treaty 88 campaign took off amid huge Aboriginal protests against the bicentennial of European settlement. In June that year, traditional owners presented the Barunga statement to Bob Hawke, who promised there would be a treaty by the end of 1990. That did not occur. Activists like Senator Thorpe say that until a treaty is signed there can be no peace or reconciliation between Indigenous people and the crown. Aboriginal child removals Aboriginal children were systematically taken from their families, communities and culture, many never to be returned, under assimilation laws and policies adopted by all Australian governments until 1970. Children were put into institutions, fostered or adopted out to non-Indigenous families. Many suffered harsh, degrading treatment, sexual abuse and were frequently indoctrinated to believe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were inferior, or that their parents were dead or did not want them. It is estimated between one in 10 and possibly as many as one in three Indigenous children were removed from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970. In 2023 22,328 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were in out-of-home care (OOHC). Indigenous children were 10.5 times more likely to be in OOHC than non-Indigenous children according to data collected by SNAICC, the national advocates for Aboriginal children and families. Under the \u201cclosing the gap\u201d agreement, Australian governments have promised to reduce the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in OOHC by 45% by 2031. That target is unlikely to be met. In fact, the federal government\u2019s own data says that nationally the removal rate of Aboriginal children is actually worsening. \u201cThe reasons for the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in child protection substantiations are complex,\u201d according to a 2019 report by the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare (AIHW). AIHW said the legacy of past policies of forced removal \u2013 known in Australia as the stolen generations, as well as poverty and generational disadvantage \u2013 were among the underlying causes. Deaths in custody According to the Australian Institute of Criminology\u2019s database, at least 576 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have died in police and prison custody since 1991. The National Deaths in Custody Program has monitored Indigenous deaths in prison, police custody and youth detention since 1980. But it only began real-time tracking in 2023 after decades of calls by advocates and family members who lost loved ones. Since January, 18 Indigenous people have died in custody. In the past 12 months two children have died in juvenile detention in Western Australia. Nationally the imprisonment rate of Indigenous adults is worsening. Last week, the Northern Territory lowered the age of criminal responsibility back to 10. The Queensland government has suspended its Human Rights Act to imprison children in police watch houses for adults; the Victorian government has backflipped on a commitment to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14; and New South Wales has toughened youth bail laws. Repatriation of human remains Institutions in the United Kingdom hold thousands of artefacts stolen from Indigenous communities during the 18th and 19th centuries. The British Museum holds human remains, listed in a macabre spreadsheet, from Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory and Tasmania as well as others whose provenance is unknown. These include the burial shroud from a baby taken from Cape York, men and women\u2019s skulls from the Northern Territory as well as cultural artefacts such as masks, sticks, knives and spears made from human bone. The British Museum Act 1963 specifically forbids the museum from disposing of its holdings. The National Heritage Act of 1983 prevents trustees of institutions, including the V&amp;A, Science Museum and others, from deaccessioning objects unless they are duplicates or beyond repair. Sovereignty, an apology and reparation Thorpe\u2019s definition of sovereignty is about Indigenous connections to the land, not about allegiance to the crown. \u201cOur sovereignty is in the soil. It\u2019s in the waters. It\u2019s in our songlines. It is what this country is made up of. We come from the land, and we are of the land,\u201d Thorpe told Guardian Australia. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to someone else\u2019s country and claim sovereignty when you\u2019re not from there ... for the so-called King of England, for him to assert or think that he has legitimate claim to this country and he is sovereign is simply not possible.\u201d Thorpe said the king should apologise as a form of reparation and that crown land should be given back to the First Peoples. \u201cWhoever wears that crown is taking on the wealth, a transfer of wealth happens. Well, what about the transfer of responsibility? Who is accountable? He\u2019s meant to be a king with power. He can use that for the good.\u201d",

Muster dogs waited patiently atop barrels and a windmill slowly twirled above a pile of hay. The community picnic, hosted by the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, and his wife Anna, was one of a string of quintessentially Australian engagements King Charles packed in on Tuesday \u2013 before he and Queen Camilla greeted a crowd of thousands at the Sydney Opera House \u2013 on the last day of their whirlwind six-day visit. While declining to eat at the barbecue, their majesties tried their luck with pairs of tongs, bantered with surf lifesavers and looked on in amusement as sheep and ducks were herded by dogs around a scrambling media scrum.

Camilla accepted my gift. This is amazing.\u201d The likelihood of another visit from the King wasn\u2019t lost on some. Queen Elizabeth II was the last reigning monarch to visit Australia in 2011, while King Charles visited most recently in 2018. A year 6 student at Rose Hill public school knew the stakes were high. \u201cI\u2019m really excited,\u201d she said solemnly in the Parramatta Park crowds. \u201cWe may not even see him again.\u201d",

He\u2019s collaborated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/mica-levi\">Mica Levi</a> and has recently become an in-demand soundtracker himself, most notably on the swimmy, heady score for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/23/charlotte-wells-on-aftersun-the-guardians-best-film-of-the-year-the-grief-expressed-is-mine\">Charlotte Wells</a>\u2019s Oscar-nominated 2022 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/23/best-films-of-2022-in-the-uk-no-1-aftersun\">Aftersun</a>.</p> <p>The latter partially inspired Coates\u2019 mesmeric new solo album, Throb, Shiver, Arrow of Time.

He even tried to wage battle between the constrictions of format and the vitality of the music: the protracted blurred, whizzing end of closer Make It Happen, he says, is \u201calmost trying to burst out of the frame, like the music is alive and trying to collapse or melt it.

The pre-semantic tonal things that we do to each other are hugely significant.\u201d</p>    <p>With the new album, he concedes, \u201cI was trying to address a shimmer, an ache within me that I noticed. There was something in my body that I was searching for and I couldn\u2019t identify whether it was a colour, a sound, a frequency, a shape.

He and his wife moved from London back to her native Scotland after having a second child during the pandemic. In London, Coates recorded in his kitchen. Glasgow has afforded him a studio, but he\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d at maintaining any kind of separation \u2013 not that he wants it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t trust myself to have splendid isolation ...

So I tend to invite the chaos of life in. There are accidents that can happen any time of day or night, and if I invest more in being present with family, then it might rub off in a way that\u2019s better than me saying, \u2018See you later guys, I\u2019m going to go and make a masterpiece.\u2019 I trust more of a slippage between everyday life and nature and going to the park and my son making a puppet.\u201d</p> <p>Life in Glasgow has also slowed him down after \u201crunning around London taking my cello on the tube for 25 years, saying yes to everything\u201d. Here, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot more done.\u201d He makes a very Coates-y digression into whether his work has become more truthful as a result, and what truthful really means \u2013 perhaps \u201cnot making something to please somebody else or satisfy somebody else\u2019s structure or idea of you\u201d. His wife\u2019s family are \u201cfrom the Highlands and the islands\u201d and brim with a wealth of folk song \u201ccoming orally through land and ancestry\u201d \u2013 the antithesis of a boyhood playing his cello in churches in Normandy and suchlike. \u201cPeople singing to each other, or a cello in a kitchen \u2013 you can\u2019t beat it. You can\u2019t beat unexpected moments of beauty, which are free, totally part of life, not part of a career or other structure.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, he sees his work with directors as a mixture of \u201cpsychology and polyphony\u201d and raves about the potential of how \u201cmanaging [to] collaborate intensely with another person and reach a moment of peace has the chance to explode and ripple out for many other people.\u201d After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a> Shazam\u2019d his music in a clothes shop, he invited Coates to soundtrack his 2023 documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/31/amsterdam-steve-mcqueen-nazis-occupied-city-bianca-stigter\">Occupied City</a>, about Holland under Nazi rule. \u201cHe said, I want you to make music about you and from your heart, not to score the film in the sense of manipulating [the images].

You write in a back-of-the-bus kind of way.\u201d To demonstrate, he gets out his phone to show me a scrawl he sent to a harpist for a new soundtrack he\u2019s working on, of a rough musical stave and some shooting, bowing lines and crisscrosses that he wants her to interpret.

You don\u2019t want to be the guy that gets the guitar out at the party, but there\u2019s a moment where you can just play something \u2013 I\u2019ve played in hospitals, some deep tones and some nice sweetness \u2013 and it does something for people.\u201d His next project is the score for The History of Sound with Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor, possibly working with Danish experimental musician ML Buch, and some long-awaited live shows \u2013 though I suspect his most cherished projects will take place closer to home, like under the bridge where his toddler daughter likes to sing and bask in the reverberations, or finding the time to join a choir again with his wife.</p> <p>Coates brings up Dart, the book-length poem by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/22/alice-oswald-interview-falling-awake\">Alice Oswald</a> about the Devon river. \u201cShe says that when she writes new poems, she doesn\u2019t have any intellectual ideas, she just listens to the tunes of the house,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the house might be empty or there might be winds blowing through it. Her poems are like melodies. I\u2019m a big believer in that \u2013 the best music is actually out there in serendipity, nature, the forest.

You don\u2019t want to be the guy that gets the guitar out at the party, but there\u2019s a moment where you can just play something \u2013 I\u2019ve played in hospitals, some deep tones and some nice sweetness \u2013 and it does something for people.\u201d His next project is the score for The History of Sound with Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor, possibly working with Danish experimental musician ML Buch, and some long-awaited live shows \u2013 though I suspect his most cherished projects will take place closer to home, like under the bridge where his toddler daughter likes to sing and bask in the reverberations, or finding the time to join a choir again with his wife. Coates brings up Dart, the book-length poem by Alice Oswald about the Devon river. \u201cShe says that when she writes new poems, she doesn\u2019t have any intellectual ideas, she just listens to the tunes of the house,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the house might be empty or there might be winds blowing through it. Her poems are like melodies. I\u2019m a big believer in that \u2013 the best music is actually out there in serendipity, nature, the forest. The way that a bird echoes off the trees is infinitely more beautiful and sustaining and varying than anything we do.\u201d \u2022 Throb, Shiver, Arrow of Time is out now on RVNG",

Here\u2019s a summary of the main news developments: Independent senator Lidia Thorpe has shrugged off calls from conservative opponents to resign from parliament after interrupting a reception for King Charles. Meanwhile, the royal couple were greeted by thousands of wellwishers at events across Sydney on Tuesday. The architect of \u201cforced birth\u201d abortion legislation in South Australia has painted high-profile women as being in a \u201cbaby-killers club\u201d on social media. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, says an overhaul of the scheme that sees developers fund infrastructure contributions in her state will ensure communities that build more homes will receive funding for key amenities like schools and parks. A former union head has doubled down on comments he made at an Australian Catholic University (ACU) graduation ceremony which compared abortion to the \u201chuman toll of World War II\u201d and alleged same-sex marriage went against \u201cevery society on Earth\u201d. Disgraced Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein has been diagnosed with a form of bone marrow cancer, according to NBC News and ABC News, which both cited anonymous sources. Thanks for reading. Have a pleasant evening. Thousands have cheered King Charles at Sydney\u2019s Opera House as they tried to gain the attention of the monarch on Tuesday afternoon. As he swapped sides, hands emerged ready to shake those of a king, according to reporters at the scene. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to meet you\u201d, a group of three teen boys wearing Australian flags said. A group of Australians broke into a rendition of \u201cGod Save The King\u201d, something that drew Charles\u2019s attention. He crossed the path, joining Camilla, and then shaking hands with those who had been singing. The royals walked over to a group of students made up of pupils from multiple schools across Sydney who performed a vibrant dance routine to the song Follow Your Dreams by Ocean Lim. The king and queen watched on, applauding the children at the end of their routine, as the young dancers yelled a collective \u201cthank you\u201d to the monarch for watching on. \u201cKing Charles, King Charles,\u201d chants filled the air. \u201cThank you for coming to Australia,\u201d yelled another as the king made his way to the end of the walkway. A band started to play God Save The King as Charles paused, turned and waved goodbye to the thousands who had come out to see him. Royal couple take to Sydney Harbour for naval fleet review The king and queen have taken to the water to participate in a naval fleet review, leaving the crowds at the Opera House. Overhead, 15 defence force helicopters have just flown passed the sails of the Opera House. A highlight of the afternoon was a surprise performance by dancers from five schools in Sydney\u2019s west and south-west, who danced to Follow Your Dreams as the king, queen and premier watched on. The song\u2019s 16-year-old composer, Ocean Lim, chatted with the royals after the dance. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt was an honour, it was one of the best times of my life.\u201d He said the queen had told him the dance was \u201creally well performed\u201d and that the king told him it was a \u201cgreat achievement\u201d and said how impressed he was. Year 5 performer Zahra Hargraves-Stanley from Samuel Terry public school in Cranebrook said the group practised for three weeks and was very nervous to dance before the royal guests. \u201cWe practised our curtsies,\u201d she said. Self-exclusion gambling register to be reviewed A review of Betstop, the national self-exclusion register for gambling, has been announced with the report expected to be delivered to the minister within 18 months, and tabled in parliament. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, and social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, announced on Tuesday a consultation process would begin later this year with the review to be conducted by public servant Richard Eccles. More than 30,000 Australians have registered with BetStop since it started in August 2023. Those who sign up are stopped from opening new gambling accounts and betting agencies cannot accept bets or send marketing material to them. Licensed wagering companies are also required to shut down any existing accounts opened by the individual. The government estimates it has saved registrants between $80m and $135m in its first year. Rowland said: We want to make sure BetStop is working as effectively as possible to protect vulnerable Australians from gambling harms \u2013 which is why my department is undertaking this review. Rishworth added: Protecting vulnerable Australians from online gambling harms is not a set and forget proposition \u2013 and we\u2019ll continue to work closely with stakeholders across government, industry and community to address this pervasive issue. Minns does not support proposed inquiry into cold cases on north coast The NSW premier, Chris Minns, does not support a special inquiry into the unresolved deaths and disappearances of 67 women on the state\u2019s north coast, which was proposed by Legalise Cannabis Party MP Jeremy Buckingham today. He says the cold case unit inside NSW police would conduct a full investigation if new information arose. Minns spoke to press a short time ago: The information that we have today is upon investigation those cases are not linked. But if circumstances change, if the public has information, that\u2019s what Crime Stoppers is for. And no one in the New South Wales police or the government will do anything other than accept that information and conduct a thorough inquiry and investigation. Asked if he would support Buckingham\u2019s proposed inquiry, Minns said: No, but here\u2019s the reason why, and that is because we\u2019ve got a cold case unit inside the New South Wales police with incredibly committed homicide squad detectives whose business it is to investigate this information, and if it is provided, I promise you, they will conduct a full investigation, a full inquiry. Now if the parliament decides to go down a different route obviously will respond to that, but I do have enormous faith in the professionalism and dedication of New South Wales police have shown in the past that they won\u2019t turn a blind eye to historic crimes, so called cold case crimes, put resources in if they see fit. More on earlier arrest of man at Sydney Opera House Police have provided more information on the arrest of Aboriginal man Wayne \u2018\u201cCoco\u201d Wharton at the Sydney Opera House forecourt earlier. Wharton was arrested after shouting that Charles \u201cis a king of thieves and a king of liars\u201d. Police said they arrested a 60-year-old man at about 1.20pm after he failed to comply with a come on direction. He was taken to Day Street police station and charged with one count of refuse/fail to comply with direction \u201cIt will be alleged the man was acting in an abusive and threatening manner and had failed to comply with two previous move on directions,\u201d New South Wales police said in a statement. He was granted conditional bail to appear at Downing Centre local court on 5 November. Security bolstered at Sydney Opera House for royal visit Security arrangements around the Sydney Opera House were bolstered as the king and queen attended a public event there on Tuesday afternoon. Images showed a sniper positioned atop of the Opera House\u2019s sails, as crowds gathered below. Meanwhile, schoolchildren appeared to perform a coordinated dance for the royal couple and other officials gathered, including the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns. Queen Camilla also appears to have changed clothes since her earlier engagement at Parramatta, out of a blue outfit and into a white dress. \u2018It\u2019s not a minor tax\u2019: premier says NSW will retain stamp duty Back to the debate about federal housing policy and comments from the housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, earlier on Tuesday that stamp duty should be scrapped by states. The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has outlined why the state will not scrap stamp duty despite agreeing with O\u2019Neil who labeled it a \u201cbad tax\u201d. Asked about the comments, Minns agreed with the federal minister but said it was consistently one of the top two sources of revenue for the state each year and the state couldn\u2019t go without it. He said: \u201cIf the federal government, in the name of housing affordability, wants to help the state\u2019s balance sheets, we\u2019d be more than happy to take that money \u2026 It\u2019s not a minor tax \u2026 we can\u2019t easily substitute that out.\u201d Earlier in the day, O\u2019Neil told the ABC that the tax was preventing people from moving \u201cand it creates cost for everyone who is selling or buying a home\u201d. Royal couple arrive at Sydney Opera House The royal couple have now arrived on the steps in front of the Sydney Opera House, where they were greeted by loud cheers from the crowds gathered. They will next participate in a Royal Australian navy fleet review on Sydney Harbour. King Charles is the colonel-in-chief of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps. They\u2019ll review the HMAS Arunta, HMAS Gascoyne, HMAS Hobart, HMAS Warramunga and HMAS Yarra, from the ceremonial cruiser, adm Hudson. They\u2019ll be accompanied by the governor general, Sam Mostyn, the chief of the defence force, adm David Johnston, and the chief of navy, vice-adm Mark Hammond. We\u2019re told that during the Fleet Review, the Royal Australian navy, the Australian Army, and the Royal Australian air force will conduct fly-pasts and more than 600 officers and sailors will conduct a \u201ccheer ship\u201d salute. More on that later. Thousands of fans in place for royal visit at Sydney Opera House Schoolchildren, adults in faux crowns and a cat on a leash: thousands of royal fans are in place to meet King Charles and Queen Camilla at the Sydney Opera House. The last time a sovereign met the crowds at the Sydney Opera House was the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2006. Here for the occasion is Rebecca Hegarty, 33, from petersham, who brought her six-month-old cat, Stormy, along. Also in the crowd were royal family diehard fans Judy Scott, 75, from Carlingford, and Margaret Cheah, 75, from Winston Hills. They travelled to the UK for William and Kate\u2019s wedding, for Jubilee celebrations are for Harry and Meghan\u2019s wedding. Scott is a lifelong republican, while Cheah is a \u201cdied-in-the-wool\u201d monarchist. \u201cWe love a party, we come together for a good occasion\u201d said Scott, four hours into their wait to see the king and queen. In the Opera House, the royals will be meeting with Kya Blondin, acting CEO of the Opera House, as well as representatives of the Bangarra Dance theatre and the Opera House Trust. The 16-year-old acrobat Lucia Richardson, tenor Jin Tea Kim, actor Heather Mitchell and violinist Harry Bennetts have also been chosen to meet the pair. A surprise last-minute addition to the schedule is British actor Joanna Lumley, who will also meet with the king on the steps of the opera house. Lumley is in Sydney to appear in her live show at the opera house tonight. Power to be restored in western NSW \u2013 for second time Power is expected to be restored \u2013 for the second time \u2013 to outback towns in western NSW after a back-up system brought in to temporarily fix a major outage failed, AAP reports. About 20,000 people in Broken Hill and surrounds were without power on Tuesday afternoon as the mercury headed for a forecast 35C. It followed severe thunderstorms last Thursday that mangled transmission infrastructure connecting the region to the national grid. A large-scale back-up generator trucked in, was supplying power to the region until it tripped at 5pm on Monday, leaving homes in the dark again. Crews worked overnight to investigate the fault and expect to restore power throughout the Far West region on Tuesday evening, the NSW government said. Singapore approves project to deliver power from NT via subsea cable The Singaporean government has given conditional approval to a $30bn-plus proposal to provide electricity to the city-state via subsea cables connected to a renewable energy development in the Northern Territory outback. SunCable\u2019s Australia-Asia Power Link plan to import renewable electricity into Singapore has been given the greenlight by Singapore\u2019s Energy Market Authority. SunCable International\u2019s interim chief executive, Mitesh Patel, said the announcement was a \u201cvote of confidence in the commercial and technical viability of our project\u201d. He said he company was aiming to supply up to 1.75 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to 15% of the city\u2019s needs. The company said it would be \u201c24/7 load sourced from solar and wind energy backed by storage\u201d. Obtaining conditional approval means SunCable can move forward with the next phase of development and commercial activities and strengthening our partnership with Indonesia. We will also progress commercial discussions with industrial customers in Singapore and engagement with the Northern Territory government and the Traditional Owners of the project site.\u201d The announcement follows the Albanese government approving the first stages of the Australian end of the project in August. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said it would be \u201ca generation-defining piece of infrastructure\u201d and the \u201clargest solar precinct in the world\u201d. Coalition to focus on detached homes rather than apartments The opposition housing spokesperson, Michael Sukkar, has suggested the Coalition\u2019s housing policy focuses more on delivering detached homes with back yards on city fringes, while Labor sees inner-city apartment blocks as the solution to the housing crisis. Sukkar, speaking to Sky News earlier on Tuesday, said that data shows first home buyers prefer detached houses with a back yard. \u201cThat\u2019s a clear preference of first time buyers and we think that Australians should have that opportunity to own a home with a back yard in a suburb. So you might refer to it as sprawl, or the experts might refer to it that way, we refer to it as suburbs,\u201d he said. Sukkar said the Coalition\u2019s focus on boosting infrastructure for so-called greenfield developments \u2013 new suburbs built on vacant lots on urban outskirts \u2013 stood in contrast to Labor\u2019s push for so-called infill development \u2013 increasing density with unit blocks in already established suburbs closer to the inner city. \u201cSo the idea that I think the Labor party\u2019s going down, which is you\u2019ve got to live in an apartment or nothing, that\u2019s not our approach. Our approach is people should have every opportunity to live in whatever they want, including a home in a greenfield suburb and we know that there are jobs and opportunities in those places,\u201d Sukkar said. Woman wedged between bounders for seven hours in NSW A woman was wedged between boulders for seven hours after she slipped head-first into a three-metre crevice while trying to retrieve her phone in regional New South Wales. The woman\u2019s friends initially spent an hour attempting to free her while she was hanging upside down before they called triple zero for help, NSW Ambulance said this week. The operation to free her from the \u201cunlikely predicament\u201d in the Hunter Valley on Saturday 12 October involved a team of \u201cmultidisciplinary\u201d emergency workers. Read more: Earlier, Tamsin Rose brought us news of \u201cMickey\u201d the cockatoo, who has been living inside a Sydney supermarket at Macarthur Square for four weeks. Our video team have put together a video, as wildlife services are continuing to try and rescue the bird \u2013 including luring him outside and using another bird to reassure him. Police surround apartment block in Sydney Specialist police surrounded a unit block in Sydney on Tuesday afternoon as they spoke with a resident within. Police urged members of the public to avoid the area around Dudley Street in Randwick, in Sydney\u2019s east, on Tuesday afternoon, as a operation was under way outside a unit block. Officers were responding to reports of a concern for welfare. \u201cPolice are speaking with a man inside a unit,\u201d NSW police said. Photographs published by the Daily Telegraph appear to show heavily armed police officers surrounding the unit. That outlet reported that at least a dozen officers were on scene, including one seen holding a chainsaw, and that the man holed up inside the unit was suspected of being armed. The health minister says the government will be starting to prosecute vendors illegally selling vapes outside of pharmacies. Under the vaping reforms passed earlier this year, vendors caught selling vapes outside pharmacies can risk up to seven years jail time and fines of up to $2.2m. Despite the new laws, the health minister Mark Butler says convenience stores and tobacconists are still illegally stocking and selling vapes, but he is \u201cdeadly serious about enforcing those penalties.\u201d Asked about vapes at a press conference in the Hunter Valley today, Butler said: We are starting to choke off supply coming in from overseas. We\u2019re seeing that from some of the reports from overseas countries like China as well, that exports to Australia are down markedly. Vape stores are starting to shut. In my electorate, for example, there were seven vape stores. They\u2019ve all shut. But our challenge now is that there are still convenience stores and tobacconists that illegally are stocking and selling vapes, and so we are talking very closely with our state colleagues about how we start to work through them in a determined fashion to make sure that that part of the trade is shut down as well. Ultimately, that\u2019s going to have to involve prosecutions. Many thanks for joining me on today\u2019s blog, I\u2019ll hand over to Elias Visontay for the afternoon, who will continue with our rolling coverage. Take care. There couldn\u2019t be a monarchical visit to Sydney without taking in the trifecta of the city\u2019s Opera House, harbour and harbour bridge. King Charles and Queen Camilla are due to arrive at the Opera House later this afternoon and around 2,000 people have already gathered to meet the royal couple. In the throng is Natalie Hulford, 44, who brought along her four-year-old pet Dachshund, Captain Bigglesworth, dressed in a pup-sized fluffy crown and cape. The small business owner said she had never seen the king but that she hoped her dog might attract his attention. We\u2019re just wanting to be a second king. We love a bit of dress-up. He\u2019s not the only royal fan in full regalia. Small business owner Meg Sakoua, 54, arrived four hours before the king and queen were due to make an appearance. She is wearing a dress patterned with Queen Elizabeth II stamps. Volunteers from the Australian Monarchist League came armed with 7,000 mini Union Jack flags to distribute to the crowd. Also queuing in the sunshine are fans from Melbourne and Brisbane who had made the trip especially to catch a glimpse of the king. Martin Sweeney, 50, a contractor from Lara in Victoria, took a day of leave and flew to Sydney for the occasion. It\u2019s the first visit to Australia by a king. It\u2019s a day when people should be united. We\u2019ve come all the way from near Geelong and even just a glimpse of the king would be enough. Vanessa Turnbull-Roberts, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people commissioner, has issued a statement in support of Lidia Thorpe. In a post to social media, Turnbull-Roberts said that what Thorpe is demanding \u2013 a \u201ctreaty republic\u201d \u2013 is \u201cwhat mob are demanding\u201d, and that treaties are \u201cnecessary to recognise historic wrongs and provide an opportunity to look at the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people\u201d. Treaty is reached after a process of negotiation, which involves the parties coming together as equals to decide on legally binding responsibilities and duties. This is long overdue. There is nothing more harmful or disrespectful than inviting the monarchy who has inflicted the genocide on our people. We don\u2019t celebrate genocide, the removal of our babies or the harm against anyone. Senator Thorpe is the person who will first show up and last to leave \u2026 [She] calls it how it is. The demands for treaty is the demands for equity. For justice. For sovereignty. More on government move to implement code on baby formula marketing The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Danielle McMullen, said the marketing of infant formula \u2013 which remains a safe and healthy alternative to breast milk \u2013 had \u201cbecome even more aggressive and irresponsible with the rise of social media\u201d. McMullen said more needed to be done to regulate toddler milks which \u2013 despite being \u201cunnecessary and unhealthy\u201d \u2013 were deceptively advertised as beneficial. Ged Kearney MP said she had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about toddler milk but said this was best addressed through the food regulatory system, which is reviewing the regulations of toddler milk. Jane Martin, the executive manager of Food for Health Alliance, said self-regulatory schemes \u201cdon\u2019t work anywhere, for anything\u201d: It\u2019s important that codes designed to affect children and babies health are made mandatory and that there are consequences. Martin said it was important that regulations also apply to retailers, and that mandatory guidelines also apply to toddler milks, which she said are marketed in a similar way to infant milks. The government has committed to mandating the \u201cineffective\u201d voluntary marketing code for infant formula products, a move widely welcomed by the health sector. Currently, companies are not obliged to comply with the voluntary code and there are no consequences for breaches. A 2023 government-commissioned review found that the agreement\u2019s \u201cvoluntary, self-regulatory approach is no longer fit for purpose\u201d and recommended a prescribed mandatory code. The consumer watchdog proposed denying the voluntary code\u2019s authorisation in September, concluding that its harms outweighed the benefits due to its voluntary nature, limited scope and inability to capture the breadth of modern digital marketing methods. In her submission to the ACCC, the assistant health minister, Ged Kearney, acknowledged stronger regulations were required. She stressed that Australia took its international obligations as a signatory to the WHO\u2019s International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk substitutes \u2013 which prohibits the marketing of infant and toddler formulas to parents \u2013 seriously. The government recommended that the voluntary code be renewed in the two year transition period. Guardian Australia reported in July that advertisers of infant products exploited the \u201chealth halo\u201d effect, which involves emphasising certain claims which perpetuated the incorrect idea the whole product was healthy, leaving infants undernourished. Huge crowds gathering near Sydney Opera House for royal visit In less than an hour, the Sydney Opera House forecourt will open ahead of a royal appearance \u2013 with huge queues already forming. Members of the public have been gathering for a chance to see King Charles and Queen Camilla around 4pm this afternoon, when the royals will join a boat at Sydney\u2019s Man O\u2019War Steps ahead of a navy fleet review. We\u2019ve been informed it is very hot in the line, which nearly reaches Circular Quay station. Aboriginal man Wayne \u201cCoco\u201d Wharton has been arrested near the Sydney Opera House after protesting about the King and Queen\u2019s visit to Australia and attempting to serve a notice for the King\u2019s arrest to the sovereign. He shouted to the crowd: Go home with the King. He is a King of thieves and a King of liars. You have no receipt, you have no agreement on the occupation of this country. You are a nation of thieves. You\u2019re guilty. The crowd of a few hundred people gathered to see the royals returned his shouts with, \u201cYou\u2019ve had your say\u201d and calls of \u201cAussie Aussie Aussie.\u201d When the police intervened, they cheered. Wharton was arrested and driven away in a police van. Before he was led away, he said \u201cWhat gives you the right to do this? These systems, these police, they create this environment. This King of England has the power to sack the prime minister, why doesn\u2019t have the power to fix the wrongs he has done?\u201d The police told him people were there \u201cfor a nice peaceful day.\u201d His daughter, Nellie Pollard-Wharton, said her father had been attempting to serve a notice for the arrest of the King. He had tried delivering the notice yesterday in Canberra, but was stopped by police. She said he would never give up his fight for Aboriginal rights. There\u2019s hope, if we stop trying, nothing will ever change. This country is built on genocide, it\u2019s well documented. Her father shouted: \u201cYou\u2019re a country of thieves. Hands up don\u2019t shoot. You don\u2019t win, you\u2019ll never win,\u201d before being driven away. Royals wrap up their visit to Parramatta Festivities in Parramatta have wrapped up for the day \u2013 at least for their Majesties, who are off to attend a sustainable markets initiative discussion at Admiral House. Around 500 people were invited to today\u2019s invite-only event, but just a few got to rub shoulders with the duo. Among them was a group of lifesavers from Surf Life Saving NSW, who had a yarn to King Charles before he took to the tongs and turned some sausages. According to the lifesavers, the king inquired how the waves were in Coogee today, to which he was asked whether he was \u201cgoing to come down and have a swim in his speedos\u201d. \u201cMaybe another time\u201d, he replied with a laugh. King Charles also put on a bit of a show while on the tongs, musing that if he stayed on the snags any longer he \u201cmight ruin them\u201d. King Charles thanks community leaders and volunteers at barbecue King Charles is now addressing the crowd at Parramatta, saying he has visited the area on a number of occasions \u201cfrom Liverpool to Richmond\u201d and it is \u201calways a particular pleasure to return\u201d. Parramatta was a place where First Nations people from around the region also came together for generations to meet and trade food, so it\u2019s a particular delight to see and smell all the top tucker here today from Western Sydney\u2019s vibrant and diverse community \u2026 I want to particularly acknowledge the community leaders and volunteers who are here today and who contribute so much to Western Sydney and beyond. As I said when I was in Australia back in 2012, volunteers [are] a glue which holds together such a diverse energetic and determined society. Chris Minns delivers speech at King\u2019s barbecue Speeches have begun at the king\u2019s barbecue in Parramatta, where the NSW premier, Chris Minns, has opened proceedings: In the same way that the British Commonwealth pulls together 56 nations into a single body, Western Sydney has stitched the world into a single community. I think it\u2019s an example of the world of how we can live together as one people despite our differences. That success is built on our citizens, on everyone here today, but it comes from the principles and traditions of British democracy. Minns said that King Charles had visited the NSW parliament and given the gift of an hourglass timekeeper \u2013 \u201cIn his words, to encourage brevity in speeches from politicians\u201d. Commonwealth Games sports for Glasgow 2026 revealed Hockey, rugby sevens and cricket are among the big-name Commonwealth Games casualties, axed from the pared-back Glasgow program in 2026, AAP reports. Next year\u2019s Games, relocated to Scotland after Victoria\u2019s withdrawal as host, will feature just 10 events, which is nine less than the previous edition held in 2022 in Birmingham. Other sports to be left out include diving, badminton, beach volleyball, mountain biking, rhythmic gymnastics, squash and table tennis. Athletics and swimming were the only sports guaranteed a spot on the program, which also includes track cycling, weightlifting, 3x3 basketball and lawns bowls \u2013 all of which include a para equivalent. Netball, artistic gymnastics, judo and boxing round out the chosen 10. Athletes and support staff will stay in hotel accommodation rather than an athletes village. The 2026 program will be officially released later tomorrow. Consumer confidence at 21-month highs, ANZ/Roy Morgan weekly survey finds We\u2019re used to hearing households and businesses are doing it tough, as indeed, many are. Interest rates at their highest since 2011 and inflation increasing at the most in three decades are putting strains on our wallets, digital or the leather variety. However, there are a few indicators turning the right way \u2013 like this week\u2019s consumer sentiment survey from ANZ and Roy Morgan. Their gauge was up 4.1 points to 87.5pt \u2013 still on the low side, historically, but its highest since January 2023. Madeline Dunk, an ANZ economist, said the pick up in confidence \u2013 which included all sub-indices \u2013 \u201cmay be linked to last week\u2019s stronger-than-expected labour market data which showed employment grew 64,100 in September\u201d. Inflation expectations also continued trending downwards, Dunk noted. (The RBA talked about the role of expectations last week, as you can read here.) Inflation figures, due out next week on 30 October, might tell us whether that better consumer confidence is warranted. King Charles visited unfinished housing project in Sydney before barbecue Before attending the barbecue in Parramatta, King Charles donned a hi-vis vest and hardhat to join the NSW premier, Chris Minns, and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, at an unfinished housing project in Glebe. Australia\u2019s housing crisis and skills shortages were among the talking points, a pool reporter has informed us, as dozens of workers waved from the windows of their office buildings across the road. The king was taken up to the building\u2019s rooftop, and met three apprentices \u2013 Sam Amey, Wes Patten and John Suttie \u2013 whose apprenticeships have been supported by King\u2019s Trust Australia. King Charles is the royal founding president of the trust, which has operated for 11 years in Australia to support young people, veterans and sustainable communities. The king greeted the former Coalition minister Julie Bishop, who is now board chair of the trust. The king and Bishop were sharing laughter when Minns called on the king to unveil a new plaque for the building. The Grassroots Action Network Tasmania (GRANT) has spoken out after the arrest of Uncle Jim Everett-puralia meenamatta earlier today, saying he was \u201cdefending forests in the central highlands\u201d of the state. Everett has since been released, GRANT said, and will be addressing the media this afternoon. He was previously arrested for defending giant eucalyptus from logging in the Styx Valley in March, refusing to attend court multiple times citing the First Nations traditional concept of Law in Country. He said at the time he did not \u201crecognise any colonial authority over me because I am not an Australian citizen\u201d. Tasmanian police confirmed one person was arrested for trespassing today at a protest, where 12 others complied with directions to leave. The Tasmanian Greens issued a statement just earlier, offering Everett their \u201cstrong support\u201d. While most Tasmanians want to see this island\u2019s forests protected, Liberal and Labor politicians continue to cheer on native forest logging. They refuse to acknowledge this industry releases huge amounts of emissions and is pushing threatened species towards extinction. It\u2019s shameful. O\u2019Brien says Kean\u2019s anti-nuclear comments were \u2018playing the man\u2019 As we noted in our earlier post, Matt Kean, the new chair of the Climate Change Authority, had some critical things to say about his former federal counterparts in the coalition on nuclear energy. Ted O\u2019Brien, the federal opposition energy spokesperson, reiterated his parties\u2019 case for nuclear, and also unveiled a new line of attack on federal Labor, as you can read here: Initially, O\u2019Brien didn\u2019t respond to Kean\u2019s comments at the AFR summit, and said he\u2019d come to us later. Here\u2019s the delayed response: If Mr Kean wants to play the man, that\u2019s for him as my interest is in good policy to deliver cheap, clean and consistent 24/7 energy. If anything, it shows that those opposed to a balanced energy mix, including zero-emission nuclear, lack any coherent intellectual argument and so they resort to name calling. Australians are struggling as they pay among the highest electricity prices in the world, and I want to assure them that the Coalition remains focused on policies to get prices down rather than being drawn into personal slanging matches. A few of those attending both Kean\u2019s speech and then O\u2019Brien\u2019s told Guardian Australia near-term issues with energy loomed far larger (and they doubted nuclear would ever happen). One attender also said it was a bit rich for O\u2019Brien to be blaming the Albanese government for \u201cforcing out\u201d coal plants. The Coalition, after all, had announced the seven sites for the nuclear plants without consulting the owners of the sites supposed to host them. King Charles and Queen Camilla have now arrived at the Parramatta Community barbecue, with Jimmy Barnes\u2019 Working Class Man played upon their arrival. The two are greeting a variety of attenders, including some surf lifesavers in uniform, among others gathered at the event. Guardian Australia\u2019s Caitlin Cassidy reports that the king and queen got on the tools at the barbecue but did not sample a sausage. The king turned one of the snags slowly. Camilla, meanwhile, just sort of struck the tongs in the air towards the sausages. \u2018Very personable\u2019: Thomas Keneally meets Queen Camilla Thomas Keneally, author of Schindler\u2019s Ark, which was adapted by Steven Spielberg into the Oscar-winning movie Schindler\u2019s List, was delighted to meet Queen Camilla earlier on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ve met her before \u2026 and find her very personable,\u201d Keneally told reporters. \u201cThis is not an adopted thing. She really loves books.\u201d Keneally wrote on Australia\u2019s relationship with the monarchy this week for the Guardian, which you can read here: OzHarvest awards Camilla with \u2018most prestigious\u2019 order of the teaspoon Earlier on Tuesday, a delighted Queen Camilla accepted \u201cthe most prestigious order\u201d ever bestowed by Australian food rescue charity OzHarvest \u2013 the order of the teaspoon \u2013 at its restaurant in Surry Hills this morning. Pool reporters following the royals have described how the silver gift \u2013 a small brooch with a crown at the end of a tiny teaspoon \u2013 was presented to the Queen when she sat down for lunch at OzHarvest\u2019s Refettorio restaurant with regular patrons who come for a free vegetarian lunch made from rescued foods. When OzHarvest\u2019s founder Ronni Kahn opened the box to show the brooch to the table, and travelling media, and present the \u201cmost prestigious order\u201d \u2013 everyone in the small dining room oohed and aahed, loudly. \u201cI shall wear it with pride,\u201d the queen said, smiling. Vegetarian options available for king at community BBQ We are hearing the king is just 10 minutes away from arriving at his Parramatta community barbecue, where guests have eagerly gathered behind a barricade of rope to greet him. Ahead of his arrival, a pop remix of Shannon Noll\u2019s What About Me plays softly in the background. Black Bear Barbecue, who have been cooking thousands of sausages and tons of beef brisket all day in the heat, are waiting to meet King Charles who will be approaching the barbecue as part of his procession. Vegetarian options are available, \u201cjust in case\u201d the king feels so inclined, according to manager Chop. Just in from Caitlin Cassidy, who is at the king\u2019s barbecue in Parramatta: the British reporters are extremely excited that there may be an appearance from the Wiggles. And while we wait for King Charles to arrive, here are some photos that have begun filtering through: Robbie Katter has recommitted to introducing a bill amending Queensland\u2019s abortion law in the next parliament. In an interview with Sky News, the Katters\u2019 Australian party leader said he would reintroduce a bill from last term which would place a duty on registered health practitioners to \u201cprovide medical care and treatment to a person born as a result of a termination\u201d: So what I\u2019m determined to do, is put back in the \u2018Babies born alive\u2019 bill, which is really just mimicking what is the code of practice in Queensland Health right now. It\u2019s a human rights issue. It\u2019s not an abortion issue to me. To me, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve determined to put back in. The KAP leader said the issue had become a campaign issue because the opposition had failed to be clear about their position. It happens with Liberal and Labor; it happened with Liberal this time, they\u2019ve been found trying to ride two horses at once He had previously said he would introduce a bill at least that strong, but depending on the nature of the parliament, might go much further, including by once again banning the medical procedure. A spokesperson for the MP said he clearly did not walk back his previous position on Sky News. It\u2019s not clear how LNP MPs would vote on the bill, with leader David Crisafulli repeatedly refusing to rule out a conscience vote. Excitement builds at king\u2019s barbecue ahead of his arrival Adam Liaw, today\u2019s MC, acknowledges by the line for sausages at the king\u2019s barbecue that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t get much bigger\u201d in terms of today\u2019s event. We have a lot of the different cultures that make up Western Sydney represented here \u2013 the things Australians enjoy \u2013 CWA, a sausage sizzle, I go to a lot of events, none obviously for this purpose before, but it\u2019s what Aussies like getting out to do. Possibly the most excited today are year 6 and year 12 students at local schools in Western Sydney, who have been invited to join today\u2019s festivities by the premier \u2013 and possibly meet the king. The principal of Rose Hill public school, Tony D\u2019Amore, speaks with Guardian Australia as behind him children sample VR goggles set up by the Western Sydney Wanderers and others gleefully sit atop a Surf Lifesaving jet ski. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity for the students \u2013 it\u2019s not every day you get to see the king or queen live. I asked the students if they wanted to go [when I found out] and they said \u2013 \u2018are you mad? Of course we want to go!\u2019. We want to make our kids feel special \u2013 opportunities that others often get. Asked what they\u2019re excited for today, one of his students replies \u201cice-cream\u201d. Year 6 student Jessica Gong says: I\u2019m really excited [to see the king]. We may not even see him again. Sheepdogs ready to show off for royals Guests at King Charles\u2019 community barbecue are eagerly readying themselves for his arrival. Stakes are particularly high for Murray Wilkinson, who is mustering his Yarum stock dogs for their majesties. The dogs have not moved from atop their barrels, monitoring the sheep, since this reporter arrived an hour ago. His dogs Meg, a border collie, and Colt, a kelpie, are used to this gig \u2013 they do it every day on his farm of 16,000 sheep and 3,000 cattle. Still, he says it was a \u201cbit of a shock\u201d to be asked to come to such an event. It\u2019s a prestigious thing to ever have happened for you. I\u2018ll say g\u2019day to them [the King and Queen], it\u2019ll be great to meet them. They\u2019ll actually be inside when I\u2019m doing the demonstration so it\u2019ll be good to work the sheep down past them \u2013 we\u2019ll see if they want to have a go themselves. Asked if he\u2019s nervous about the dogs, he replies \u201cno, they know their job\u201d: They know they\u2019re on show, that\u2019s for sure ... they\u2019re a bit like everyone, aren\u2019t they? They know when it\u2019s on. King Charles\u2019 motorcade still approaching Parramatta barbecue The King\u2019s motorcade is still approaching Parramatta park for a barbecue thrown in his honour this morning as a Welcome to Country gets underway. The theme is quintessentially Australian-heavy \u2013 two sheepdogs sit patiently on barrels waiting to muster a herd of sheep and a windmill slowly twirls above a barrel of hay. A number of vendors are offering samples of their goods, including gelato-heavyweights Messina who are offering \u201cregal scoops\u201d of ice cream, and surf living vendors dishing out an \u201cAussie barbecue\u201d and sustainable Murray cod. Elsewhere, Henna and traditional dance is on offer, as are Anzac biscuits from the Country Women\u2019s Association, who have spent hours sewing a scone onto an apron for the King. Guests lucky enough to nab an invite includes Vietnamese-Australian writer Anh Do, singer and actress Delta Goodrem, former cricketer Dave Warner, Young Australian of the Year Dr Nikhil Autar and students from local schools across Western Sydney. Malaysian Australian chef and TV show host Adam Liaw is emceeing. Prior to proceedings kicking off, he told Guardian Australia he was waiting to sample the goods on offer after the formalities \u2013 having already spilt coffee on his shirt \u2013 but was particularly excited about the banh mi. Allan calls out Queensland LNP for \u2018threatening a woman\u2019s right to chose\u2019 The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has marked 16 years since abortion was decriminalised in Victoria. In a post to social media, she wrote that this \u201cgave women and practitioners the peace of mind that their choice, was exactly that \u2013 their choice\u201d. She continued, pointing to the Queensland election this weekend: Yet, 16 years later, women are still facing uncertainty around their health and safety when it comes to abortion. Right now in Queensland, on the eve of their state election, the Liberal opposition leader is threatening a woman\u2019s right to choose. And in the United States, well, we all know what happened there. Women\u2019s bodies shouldn\u2019t be up for debate in 2024. They never should have been in the first place. Abortion is health care. Simple as that. As Ben Smee reports, LNP leader David Crisafulli and his party have repeatedly said they have \u201cruled out\u201d changes to the state\u2019s 2018 laws that decriminalised abortion. But candidates have all refused to say how they would vote if a reform bill came before the next parliament, amid speculation of a conscience vote. NSW police respond to new data on strip searches NSW police have provided a response to data from the Redfern Legal Centre showing police had strip-searched 66 children aged between 10 and 17 at train stations in the state over the past eight years. You can read the full post earlier in the blog from Jordyn Beazley, here. NSW police responded with the following statement: A strip-search will only be conducted if at a police station the searching officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the strip-search is necessary for the purposes of the search, or in any other place if the officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the strip-search is necessary for the purposes of the search and that the seriousness and urgency of the circumstances make the strip-search necessary at that place. Our reporter Caitlin Cassidy is on the scene at Parramatta, and says the Country Women\u2019s Association have spent hours creating an apron for King Charles, featuring their iconic scone: Latest from the royal itinerary across Sydney Pool reporters have let us know that a small crowd gathered outside the National Center for Indigenous Excellence in Redfern earlier this morning to meet King Charles, as we flagged earlier. Chairperson of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council, Allan Murray, told the king \u201cwe\u2019ve got stories to tell and I think you witnessed that story yesterday\u201d as she welcomed him to Gadigal land. The king was led to meet Beryl Booth, who served his majesty 40 years earlier during another Australian tour. Aunty Beryl served the king kangaroo pies, before he was rushed off to the sports hall. King Charles greeted by traditional Indigenous dancers from Brolga Dance Academy and the Mui Mui Bedlam dance group. He then went into a private meeting with key Indigenous Elders. The royal couple are now attending a barbecue in Parramatta, where NSW police inspector Amy Scott will be in attendance. Their royals will also meet Noemie Fox, who won gold in kayak cross in Paris, Indigenous entertainer Casey Donovan, writer, artist and comedian Anh Do, and Paralympian swimmer Timothy Hodge. The emcee will be chef Adam Liaw. NSW MP claims unsolved disappearances and deaths inadequately investigated because victims were women \u2018from the regions\u2019 Continuing from our last post: Jeremy Buckingham said \u201cevery police officer in the state would be on the case\u201d if the 67 unresolved disappearances and deaths of women on the NSW north coast were incidents in Sydney\u2019s eastern or northern suburbs. These women were regional, they were poor, they were black, and they weren\u2019t at the front of mind for the police. That\u2019s clear. The coronial inquests have made damning findings about the quality of those investigations. Imagine if this was the situation in the eastern suburbs of Sydney or the northern beaches of Sydney. Sixty women had been brutally murdered or disappeared. There would be public outrage, and every police officer in the state would be on the case. But these women were from the regions. They were poor, they were young, they were black, they were hippies, and so if you don\u2019t look, you don\u2019t see. As we just flagged, Buckingham is calling for an inquiry into these unresolved deaths and disappearances from the 1970s to mid-2000s (which he says could be attached to \u201cthe worst serial killer or killers in Australian history\u201d). NSW police said a number investigations over the years investigated the disappearance of women on the state\u2019s north coast. A spokesperson said: To this date, there is no evidence to indicate a common offender was responsible for the disappearances. The matters remain under investigation by state crime command\u2019s homicide squad unsolved homicide team and the missing person registry. NSW MP calls for inquiry into unresolved deaths and disappearances of women on state\u2019s north coast Jeremy Buckingham, MP for the Legalise Cannabis NSW Party, is calling for an inquiry into the unresolved deaths and disappearances of dozens of women on the state\u2019s north coast over three decades \u2013 which he says could be attached to \u201cthe worst serial killer or killers in Australian history\u201d. Buckingham told press his investigations found 67 unresolved homicides and disappearances of women on the north coast from the late 1970s to the mid 2000s. Speaking from state parliament, he said the incidents are \u201ca complete anomaly\u201d in Australia: It is utterly unacceptable, completely egregious, that this has come to pass. The victims, their families and communities demand to know what happened to their daughters, their mothers ... the people of New South Wales need to know what has happened, and the perpetrator or perpetrators of these crimes must be brought to justice. This may well be the worst serial killer or killers in Australian history, and it has not been public knowledge, and they have not been brought to justice, that is an utterly unacceptable situation. Buckingham pointed to the small population, the modus operandi (a pattern in a mode of operating), the type of women and the way the women were killed. He said criminologists and senior police, such as former NSW police deputy commissioner Michael Willing, say it is likely the cases are linked. Buckingham also said the investigation should take the same form as the special commission of inquiry into LGBTIQ hate crimes. The Victorian government will trial charging developers to fund infrastructure like schools and parks in areas where new housing will be built, as part of a shift to a state-wide infrastructure contribution scheme. The premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing a new scheme which will be trialled in ten of the government\u2019s \u201cactivity centres\u201d \u2013 which it has earmarked for fast-tracking of high-rise developments. It is one of a series of housing policies the Victorian government had announced this week in an effort to boost supply of homes across the state. Speaking to reporters, Allan said the scheme will link infrastructure funding to the building of new homes: Communities that build more homes should also have the opportunity to receive the funding they need for the things that make those communities great. It\u2019s only fair to take that approach. The development charge will be rolled out from 1 January 2027 in the first ten activity centres in Broadmeadows, Camberwell, Chadstone, Epping, Frankston, Moorabbin, Niddrie, North Essendon, Preston and Ringwood. The government says a working group will create a new state-wide infrastructure contribution scheme. It will replace an existing model made up of levies that exist in half of Victoria\u2019s local government areas. Efforts to rescue cockatoo stuck inside Sydney supermarket for four weeks Efforts continue to rescue a cockatoo that has been \u201cliving on brioche\u201d inside a Sydney supermarket at Macarthur Square for four weeks. The New South Wales environment minister, Penny Sharpe, has pledged to save the cockatoo, called Mickey, and said: Mickey the cockatoo is not going to be shot. I have directed the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service to find out how we can help Mickey and the team at Coles. National Parks is in contact with wildlife rescue groups and staff at Coles Macarthur Square. Mickey will be freed. The bird has been stuck in the Coles at Macarthur Square in Campbelltown for weeks, according to the Sydney Metropolitan Wildlife Services. A post from the group this morning stated that while efforts were being made to save the bird, it had been a \u201cnightmare\u201d. The poor bird hasn\u2019t had any dark for over four weeks and has been living on brioche and illegally placed water by the night manager \u2013 who is very fond of the bird. Two traps [were] left but with so much food in the store, who knows if that will work. Hopefully we exhausted him so much he will come down to a trap for water. Coles has been contacted for comment. NSW police provide more information on critical incident on Great Western Highway NSW police have said it\u2019s too early in the investigation to say what arose police suspicion before they followed a car that soon after crashed into another, resulting in the death of a driver on his way to work. Police have declared the crash that occurred on Sydney\u2019s Great Western Highway at around 4am this morning a critical incident, with the alleged driver arrested but yet to be charged. This morning, NSW police assistant commissioner Gavin Wood told reporters the police weren\u2019t in pursuit of the 43-year-old driver, but had turned their lights and siren on to pass through a red light and follow the driver. He said the two officer\u2019s next vision of the car was it crashed into a Toyota Corolla. The driver of the Corolla, a 49-year-old male who is yet to be formally identified, was pronounced dead at the scene after police provided first aid. Wood said: This is a tragedy beyond belief. You have an innocent 49 year old mile going to work, he doesn\u2019t go to work, he doesn\u2019t go home, his family don\u2019t get to see him. You\u2019ve got young police out doing their job, protecting the community at 4am so this is a tragedy in a number of ways, but for that poor man and his family and friends, their life has changed from this incident. There\u2019s no question about that. Wood alleged the driver ran away from police following the crash, and was soon after found at a residential home attempting to take clothes from a clothes line. Police said the investigation into the incident will undergo an independent review. SA police commissioner speaks to media following court outcome Just earlier the South Australian police commissioner, Grant Stevens, addressed the media following news the 19-year-old who struck his son, Charlie, at schoolies last year had been handed a suspended sentence. Stevens agreed with comments from the judge that no matter what happened in the courtroom \u201ctoday will not change anything for our family\u201d, and said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d this part of the process is over: Each court date that has come up has been difficult, stressful and emotional for our family. We are grateful that he chose to plead guilty to a defence because that was part of it to a conclusion much more quickly. It is one of those things that we are continuing to learn how to live with every single day without Charlie. He thanked South Australians for their support, and said the family will \u201calways reminded of his absence.\u201d The young driver who fatally struck South Australian police commissioner Grant Stevens\u2019 son Charlie has avoided going to jail over the hit-run tragedy during Schoolies week in 2023. As AAP reports, 19-year-old Dhirren Singh Randhawa from Encounter Bay was sentenced in the SA district court to one year, one month and seven days in jail, with a non-parole period of seven months \u2013 suspended on condition he is of good behaviour for two years. He has also been banned from driving for 10 years. He had pleaded guilty to aggravated driving without due care and leaving the scene of a crash at Goolwa Beach, south of Adelaide, on 17 November 2023. The court was told Charlie, 18, and three friends were celebrating schoolies and had flagged down Randhawa at 9pm to ask for a ride to Victor Harbor. But he declined, explaining that he did not want to risk demerit points on his P-plates. He performed a U-turn and accidentally struck Stevens, causing irreversible brain damage. Stevens died at Flinders medical centre the next day. Randhawa drove away in \u201cshock and disbelief\u201d but stopped when he saw a police car and told them what happened. In court on 3 October, Randhawa addressed Stevens\u2019 family, telling them that learning Charlie\u2019s life support had been switched off \u201cwas the most difficult thing I\u2019ve heard in my life\u201d: There\u2019s so much I\u2019d like to say, but mostly I want to say I\u2019m sorry. And I\u2019m sorry Charlie. As part of today\u2019s royal itinerary, King Charles has been meeting with Indigenous leaders in Sydney. The palace had previously said the king would meet Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives and groups to learn about their work in supporting local communities and strengthening culture. Here are some photos that have begun filtering through from the event, held at the National Centre for Indigenous Excellence: Vision is currently being broadcast of the king watching a ceremony inside the centre. Data shows NSW police conducting around 100 strip-searches on average each year Police have strip-searched 66 children aged between 10 and 17 at train stations in New South Wales over the past eight years. The data, obtained by Redfern Legal Centre (RLC), showed from 2016 to 2024 NSW police conducted a total of nearly 900 strip-searches, equalling around 100 on average each year. A disproportionate number of these searches were conducted on First Nations people, the data showed. Eighty-two searches were conducted on First Nations people over the eight years, making up approximately 9% of the total number. Samantha Lee, supervising solicitor at RLC, said the strip-searches were conducted with a lack of privacy and were therefore in violation of the law. The Law Enforcement Powers and Responsibilities Act states police, when carrying out a strip-search, are required to conduct it \u201cas far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances\u201d in a \u201cprivate area.\u201d Lee said: There is no privacy at a train station. Sometimes police set up curtain-like structures on the platform, but commonsense tells you this is incredibly inadequate. Subjecting children to this invasive procedure in such a public space is appalling. RLC said police powers to conduct strip-searches were only meant to be exceptional circumstances, but are instead being routinely applied by police. RLC called on the NSW government to take immediate action to reform strip-search laws. Redfern Legal Centre and law firm Slater &amp; Gordon are currently running a landmark class action against the state government to pursue compensation for people who allege they were illegally strip-searched at music festivals. NSW police have been contacted for a response. The National Tertiary Education Union has called for Julie Bishop to be sacked as ANU chancellor after comments she made to the Canberra Times. ANU management have asked staff to forgo an agreed pay rise of 2.5% in December, amid a restructure the union says risks more than 600 job losses. Speaking to the Canberra Times, Bishop was asked if it was fair of the university to ask staff to give up their pay rises when they believed they had not contributed to its financial woes. She responded: It depends to whom you refer, because many members of staff have been part of the inefficiencies that the university is now seeking to address. Bishop also said colleges had hired too many staff to replace those lost during Covid-19 lockdowns, when the ANU was excluded from the jobseeker scheme, and this has been addressed \u201cby centralising the HR process\u201d which would \u201cstabilise our workforce at an appropriate and sustainable level\u201d. In a statement, the NTEU\u2019s national president, Dr Alison Barnes, said comments \u201cblaming staff when it\u2019s clear there\u2019s been managerial incompetence are simply staggering\u201d: Bashing workers might have helped Ms Bishop climb through ranks of the Liberal party but an attack like this makes her role as chancellor completely untenable. If Julie Bishop won\u2019t resign today, she must be sacked. At a time when 600 jobs are on the line, blaming staff is reprehensible. This is emblematic of a broken governance system that needs an urgent federal parliamentary inquiry. Australian workplaces failing women of colour, report shows A report from Women of Colour Australia in partnership with ANU shows two in three women of colour had experienced discrimination in the workplace, AAP reports. Despite the data showing growing awareness of anti-discrimination laws and psychosocial safety requirements, Women of Colour Australia\u2019s founder and executive director, Brenda Gaddi, said discrimination was escalating. Women of colour reported having their opinions and ideas dismissed, discrimination based on names and accents and stress from not being able to bring their whole and authentic selves to work. Discrimination was a common reason women of colour surveyed were planning to quit, with lack of career progression and job insecurity also cited as drivers. Nearly half were planning to resign within the next 12 months. Too few women of colour felt alerting their employer would lead to effective recourse, with only half aware of a formal mechanism to report a discrimination incident. Gaddi recommended setting up an external body or ombudsman for women of colour to report to in the knowledge they would be heard and there would be consequences for racism. Victorian premier labels Thorpe protest \u2018deeply disrespectful\u2019 The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has described Victorian senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s protest against King Charles as \u201cdeeply disrespectful.\u201d Speaking to 3AW, Allan says Thorpe\u2019s interjection of a parliamentary reception \u201cdoes not represent the the respect that Victorians have for the king\u201d: Lidia Thorpe\u2019s behaviour is deeply disrespectful. It\u2019s unacceptable. When you\u2019re elected to parliament ... you should recognise that there is a standard to which you should behave. That is not what we saw from Lidia Thorpe yesterday. Allan was also asked about her decision, alongside other state premiers, to decline an invitation to meet with the king during his visit. She said: I think it\u2019s great that the king is visiting the country. We would have loved to have seen him here in Melbourne and Victoria, but we know his schedule was such that his trip was focused around Sydney and Canberra. The deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, has labelled calls from Peter Dutton for Lidia Thorpe to resign as \u201ccontemptible\u201d. She said: Peter Dutton and the Liberals calling for Senator Thorpe to resign for telling the truth is contemptible. That\u2019s what should be condemned, not a protest against the monarchy. Colonial forces that inflict huge suffering and have committed horrific atrocities on First Nations peoples can\u2019t then complain about protests against them. It is a fact that the British committed genocide here, it is a fact that their racist legacy lives on in Australia today and that should absolutely be resisted and confronted. Faruqi said Australia \u201cneed[s] to move forward to a republic that comes with truth telling and treaty.\u201d In a statement before her protest yesterday, Thorpe called for a \u201ctreaty republic\u201d and said that Australia had \u201cunfinished business that we need to resolve before this country can become a republic\u201d \u2013 and that this \u201cmust happen through treaty\u201d. Coalition claims Albanese government plans to force coal plants to close early Following not so far behind the energy minister Matt Kean\u2019s comments critical of nuclear energy, the federal opposition energy spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, has fronted the AFR energy summit in Sydney. Perhaps not surprisingly, O\u2019Brien has gone on the offensive. He says the opposition will release costs for the planned seven nuclear plants \u201cby the end of this year\u201d and that he\u2019s \u201cvery excited about releasing it\u201d. It\u2019s up to Labor, O\u2019Brien says, to reveal the total cost of the transition for the grid to net zero emissions by 2050. However, perhaps the novel aspect of today\u2019s speech is to try to turn the tables on Labor by saying the Albanese government is \u201cforcibly\u201d shutting coal-fired plants early. What he\u2019s done is to take one of the scenarios of the Australian Energy Market Operator\u2018s integrated system plan on when it thinks the plants will shut and compared it with the declared closure dates by the plant owners. It looks like this: O\u2019Brien also listed the plants and their size, and says the government should tell each community when they will close. However, they are commercial decisions, and it will be up to their owners (mostly private, save for those in Queensland) to set their dates based on the market. In other words, it\u2019s a red herring. Meanwhile, as it happens, Aemo has this morning posted on social media a fresh record for the penetration of renewable energy in the grid. Clearly, it\u2019s been windy and sunny in most of eastern Australia. Royals continue their Australian tour in Sydney King Charles and Queen Camilla are continuing their tour of Australia today, with a number of events planned in Sydney. The king will meet with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives and groups, while the queen will visit a library and meet children taking part in a Queen\u2019s Commonwealth essay competition workshop. They will be guests of honour at a community barbecue in western Sydney and also meet Australians of the Year and cancer researchers Prof Georgina Long and Prof Richard Scolyer and learn about their work addressing melanoma. This afternoon, the king and queen will reconvene at the Sydney Opera House before conducting a fleet review of the Royal Australian Navy in Sydney Harbour. Those wishing to see the royals at the Sydney Opera House forecourt can arrive from 3pm and should be in place by 4pm. The king and queen and their entourage leave Australia tomorrow. For more details, you can read more from Daisy Dumas below: Dreyfus marks six years since national apology to victims of institutional child sexual abuse The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has released a statement on the sixth anniversary of the national apology to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. In the statement, Dreyfus said the apology stands as \u201can enduring reminder of the profound impacts of child sexual abuse, as well as our collective responsibility to take action to prevent it\u201d. I acknowledge the strength and courage of victims and survivors, their families and loved ones. Thank you for sharing your stories and paving the way for change. I say to you: we are sorry, we believe you and we will do better. Here is the full apology speech delivered in October 2018 by the then prime minister, Scott Morrison: Lifeline: 13 11 14 Minns says Thorpe protest was \u2018grossly disrespectful\u2019 The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has said Lidia Thorpe\u2019s protest against King Charles yesterday was \u201cgrossly disrespectful\u201d. As AAP reports, Minns is set to host a community barbecue for the royal couple today. He told 2GB radio: Everything that particular senator does seems to revolve around herself, as if she\u2019s attempting to make herself, that senator, the focus of all attention. Macquarie comes in last in climate strategies rankings for Australia\u2019s big five banks A report from the Australian Conservation Foundation has ranked Macquarie Bank last when it comes to the climate strategies of Australia\u2019s five biggest banks. Out of 100, Macquarie scored 50.19. ANZ was only slightly above at 50.85, and next in line were NAB (58.1), CommBank (57.86) and Westpac (61.85). Some of the report\u2019s key findings included: All major banks lacked clear policies to end support for new oil and gas projects. Banks are beginning to close loopholes on fossil fuel lending by restricting bonds facilitation for polluting projects. Banks are starting to align executive remuneration with climate change metrics. CommBank, NAB, Westpac and ANZ have all set some form of requirement for fossil-fuel intensive companies to implement a transition plan by 2025, but details on how the plans will be assessed remain unclear. Jonathan Moylan, ACF\u2019s corporate campaigner and a co-author of the report, said there has been progress across the sector but \u201cit needs to accelerate rapidly to spur on the decarbonisation of our economy that\u2019s needed to address the climate crisis\u201d: The majority of progress made by banks this year was due to the tightening of lending policies to environmentally harmful industries, but bank lending policies remain the area requiring the most action for banks to meet their net zero commitments. More reactions to Thorpe AAP has more reactions to Lidia Thorpe\u2019s comments at King Charles\u2019 parliamentary reception yesterday. Labor government minister Amanda Rishworth told the Today program Senator Thorpe\u2019s actions were \u201cpretty disrespectful and not just to the King, but to the many great Australians that had gathered in the Great Hall\u201d: We\u2019re pretty shocked and didn\u2019t quite understand why this was going on, so it was very disrespectful. But it didn\u2019t put a dampener on ... the very positive rest of the welcome ceremony, which I think was really very positive. Nationals MP Bridget McKenzie said she was appalled and told Nine: If you\u2019re not a fan of King Charles and Queen Camilla, don\u2019t accept the prime minister\u2019s invitation. As we flagged earlier, the federal opposition is considering raising a censure motion against Thorpe in the upper house when it next sits on 8 November. A statue of Queen Victoria in the Sydney CBD has reportedly been vandalised with red paint. NSW police said it was called to reports the statue had been vandalised about 5.30am today, with a crime scene established and investigation commenced. A photo sent to 2GB shows streaks of red paint across the base of the statue. Anyone with information was urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Wine Australia says exports have increased by 34% in value Wine Australia says Australian wine exports have increased by 34% in value to $2.39bn in the 12 months to September. China dropped tariffs on Australian wine in March, and the latest levels of shipment by both volume and value are the highest since the 12 months ending August 2021, Wine Australia said. The value of shipments to mainland China increased by $604m to $612m, while volume increased by 58m litres to 59m litres. Wine Australia\u2019s manager of market insights, Peter Bailey, said: While the export figures to mainland China are very positive, the impact on total export value is much larger than volume due to the premium price point of most wine entering the market. As such, this increase is unlikely to reduce the oversupply of red winegrapes in the warm inland regions \u2026 Export levels are not equivalent to retail figures, and it will take time before it is evident how Chinese consumers are reacting to having Australian wine back in market. Birmingham argues Thorpe would \u2018revel in being censured\u2019 While there is discussion this morning about whether the parliament may censure Lidia Thorpe after her interruption of the reception for King Charles, the Coalition\u2019s Senate leader is already hosing down the prospect. Simon Birmingham, the shadow foreign minister, said this morning at a doorstop: One of the problems is Lidia Thorpe would probably revel in being censured by the Senate. And so, we\u2019ve got to think carefully about how we respond to this in ways that try to prevent such behaviour in the future, but don\u2019t give her the oxygen that she so desires for these types of antics. Birmingham is the opposition leader in the Senate, where Thorpe sits, so his comments go some way to the Coalition\u2019s position on this issue. Clare O\u2019Neil, the housing minister, was asked on Radio National earlier whether the government would support a censure. She would only say that they wanted to \u201csee what the Liberals come forward with specifically\u201d. As we mentioned earlier, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has said Lidia Thorpe should \u201cresign in principle\u201d, calling her interjection at the parliamentary reception for King Charles and Queen Camilla \u201cpredictable\u201d. Dutton said on Sunrise this morning: I think there\u2019s a very strong argument for somebody who doesn\u2019t believe in the system, but is willing to take a quarter of a million dollars a year from the system, to resign in principle. If you were really truly about your cause and not just about yourself, then I think that\u2019s a decision that you would make. The Nine newspapers reported this morning some Liberal politicians are considering whether to seek a censure of Thorpe in parliament. On Radio National, as we brought you earlier, Thorpe claimed \u201cevery time I see him [Dutton] in Parliament he walks in the opposite direction, so he never wants to sit down and have a conversation\u201d. The opposition leader went on to criticise Thorpe\u2019s interruption in his Sunrise spot: My reaction was that, \u2018here we go again\u2019. It was entirely predictable, all about herself. It doesn\u2019t advance any cause that she\u2019s interested in. It\u2019s really just a self-promotion thing, which is why I don\u2019t think we should give it any attention. Unfortunately, it overshadowed what I think\u2019s been a very successful visit so far. I think it was disrespectful, and most Australians dismiss it on that basis. Watch: the moment Lidia Thorpe was sworn in as senator As we reported earlier, Nova Peris, the first Aboriginal woman in the Australian parliament, has criticised Lidia Thorpe\u2019s actions at King Charles\u2019 parliamentary reception yesterday. Novis pointed to Thorpe affirming allegiance to the Crown and said if she \u201cwas not on board with this, she should not have accepted her position and made her affirmation in the first place\u201d. When Thorpe was sworn in, in August 2022, she was told to repeat the oath of allegiance after she initially described the Queen as a coloniser. Speaking to ABC RN this morning (see earlier post), Thorpe said she had sworn allegiance \u201cunder duress\u201d and it was \u201ca very, very difficult thing to do as a Blak, sovereign woman.\u201d However, I was told that if I didn\u2019t do it, I couldn\u2019t be a senator to bring Blak issues into this space and around the world\u2026 You can watch the moment Thorpe was first sworn in as a senator below: Great Western Highway closed at St Marys after fatal Sydney crash NSW police have declared a critical incident after a fatal car crash in western Sydney early this morning. About 4am, two officers in marked vehicles saw a dark-grey Holden Insignia sedan stopped. Police stopped near the sedan when the driver allegedly accelerated towards the Great Western Highway and police lost sight of it. Police followed and found the sedan had hit a silver Toyota Corolla hatchback. Police allege the driver of the sedan fled the scene on foot. The driver of the hatchback \u2013 who is yet to be formally identified, but is believed to be in his 40s \u2013 died at the scene. A 43-year-old man, alleged to be the driver of the sedan, was arrested a short time later and taken to Nepean hospital under police guard for mandatory testing. A crime scene has been established and a critical incident team is investigating. The investigation is also subject to an independent review. Anyone with dashcam footage or information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. The Great Western Highway is closed in both directions at St Marys, between Glossop Street and Sydney Street. Government announces $7bn missile acquisition deal with the US The Albanese government has announced a $7bn agreement with the United States to acquire long-range missiles, aimed at bolstering Australia\u2019s air and missile defence. The acquisition of the Standard Missile 2 Block IIIC (SM-2 IIIC) and Standard Missile\u20116 (SM-6) is a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d in the government\u2019s progress in boosting long-range capability, a media release from the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said. The missiles will be progressively deployed across the Navy\u2019s Hobart-class destroyers and in the future, the Hunter-class frigates, the statement said. Conroy said Australia is facing \u201cthe most complex geostrategic environment since the second world war\u201d and the acquisition was about \u201cmoving fast to keep Australians safe, deter any adversary, and defend Australia\u2019s national interests in the missile age\u201d: Australia was the first country, other than the United States, to fire the SM-6 missile, underscoring the strength of our alliance. Matt Kean, the new chair of the Climate Change Authority, has told the AFR\u2019s energy conference in Sydney that \u201cwe simply can\u2019t afford to wait\u201d for energy breakthroughs over the horizon as coal is phased out of the grid. Kean, a former NSW energy minister, took particular aim at nuclear energy, a policy being advocated by his erstwhile federal Coalition counterparts, dubbing it an \u201cilliberal drive in a market-led energy transition [that] has been elevated from internet chatrooms and lobby groups to the national stage\u201d. \u201cThe delay-mongers have latched on to nuclear power, despite the overwhelming evidence that [it] could drive up energy bills and can only be more expensive\u201d with no aid for the present cost-of-living crisis, he said. I suspect that even those arguing for nuclear don\u2019t believe that we\u2019ll ever build one of these reactors in Australia, and certainly not in time to help manage the exit of coal from the system. Perhaps the biggest cost of nuclear is time. It is precious time that neither our economy or our environment can afford. Those pushing the technology were really trying to \u201csqueeze out profits\u201d from their existing energy assets, he said, referring particularly to coal, it would seem. Ted O\u2019Brien, the federal opposition\u2019s energy minister, will speak at the conference in about an hour, and presumably won\u2019t welcome Kean\u2019s warmup speech. On the issue of when the authority will deliver its advice to the government on what Australia\u2019s 2035 targets should be, Kean would not be drawn on whether they are likely to be this side of the federal elections. (It\u2019s likely they will be after the polls, if this correspondent were to put down a wager.) Thorpe apologises for now-deleted social media post from staffer Late last night, independent senator Lidia Thorpe apologised for a now-deleted social media post, depicting a carton King Charles being beheaded. It was posted without her knowledge to her Instagram story by a staff member, and promptly deleted as soon as she saw it, Thorpe said. An apology on her Instagram story reads: Earlier tonight, without my knowledge, one of my staff shared an image to my Instagram stories created by another account. I deleted it as soon as I saw. I would not intentionally share anything that could be seen to encourage violence against anyone. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m about. Communities in far west NSW are being urged to prepare for a prolonged power outage, after a backup generator tripped yesterday afternoon. A severe storm rolled through the area last week, flattening transmission towers and leaving thousands without power or running on diesel generators. The NSW DCCEEW (Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water) said crews worked through the night to investigate a fault with the generator, with repairs expected to continue today: Additional generators will arrive in Broken Hill today, and teams from Transgrid and Essential Energy will work to safely connect them to the network. More generators are also on their way to provide additional back-up supply, while emergency work continues to rebuild the transmission network damaged in severe storms. Six public schools are closed amid the power outages, including: Alma public school Broken Hill public school Burke Ward public school Morgan Street public school Railway Town public school School of the Air Lidia Thorpe was also asked how King Charles specifically is complicit in crimes committed against First Nations people. His family and his kingdom are absolutely responsible for what happened to my people in this country. They came to the shores with guns \u2026 Has he done anything about it? If you stay silent, then you are complicit. Thorpe continued, said the king should have \u201ctake[n] leadership\u201d: Why doesn\u2019t he take his crown and use the leadership \u2026 that he supposedly has to end the conflict in this country? Why won\u2019t he treaty? Why didn\u2019t his ancestors treaty with us when they [made a treaty] with New Zealand? \u2026 Why doesn\u2019t he apologise then for his ancestors? Why doesn\u2019t he say, I am sorry for the many, many thousands of massacres that happened in this country, and that my ancestors and my kingdom are responsible for that? And by the way, we\u2019ll start handing back your bones, your skulls and everything else we stole from you as a as a gesture of good faith and treaty making. \u2018I\u2019m not looking to get re-elected, I\u2019m looking to get justice\u2019: Thorpe Lidia Thorpe was asked about comments from the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, that she should resign on principle if she doesn\u2019t believe in the system. Thorpe said that Dutton should say it \u201cto [her] face\u201d: Because every time I see him in Parliament he walks in the opposite direction, so he\u2019s he never wants to sit down and have a conversation\u2026 I really don\u2019t care what [he] says, I\u2019m in this job for another three and a half years, and I\u2019m not looking to be re-elected \u2013 I\u2019m looking to get justice for my people. Thorpe says she swore allegiance to crown \u2018under duress\u2019 in order to \u2018bring Blak issues into this space\u2019 Lidia Thorpe was asked about criticism about her actions at parliament house yesterday, and responded that she doesn\u2019t \u201csubscribe to assimilating myself into the colonial structure.\u201d However, I will be there for another three years, everybody. So, you know, get used to truth telling. My approach, unfortunately, might upset a few people, but how else do you get your message across when we [are] continually shut down as Blak women. The only people they want to hear from are ones that conform and speak nicely, but do nothing about getting justice for our people. Asked if she has \u201cassimilated\u201d by affirming allegiance to the crown, Thorpe said she \u201chad to do that to fulfil my my duties, and I can guarantee you, I did that under duress\u201d. When Thorpe was sworn in, she was told to repeat the oath of allegiance after she initially described the Queen as a coloniser. Thorpe continued, and said: I sought permission from my family. It was a very, very difficult thing to do as a Blak, sovereign woman. However, I was told that if I didn\u2019t do it, I couldn\u2019t be a senator to bring Blak issues into this space and around the world\u2026 Independent senator Lidia Thorpe is speaking with ABC RN about her decision to shout at the king during yesterday\u2019s parliamentary reception. She has since made international headlines for the move, and said her aim was to let the \u201cworld to know the plight of our people in this country\u201d: We have 24,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in [and] out of home care in 2024, it\u2019s worse than the stolen generation. We have over 600 deaths in custody that we know about that does not include babies who\u2019ve died in the system. So without justice, what do we have? We have no peace. And so I\u2019ve written to the king a number of times. He\u2019s ignored me every time I wanted to have a respectful conversation and meeting about the plight of our people and what we want, what my old people have told me all of my life, and that wasn\u2019t afforded to me. So I did that for my people, I did that for my grandmother, and I wanted the world to know that we need a treaty here, and we want an end to this ongoing war against first people in this country. Dutton says he would \u2018explain the rationale\u2019 behind nuclear to premiers who oppose plan Peter Dutton was asked about the Queensland LNP leader David Crisafulli, who has said he isn\u2019t a fan of the federal opposition\u2019s energy plan. How would he persuade Crisafulli to change his mind, Dutton was asked? He said he would \u201cexplain the rationale\u201d and pitch nuclear to the premiers: That\u2019s the pitch that I would make to Premier [Peter] Malinauskas, or Premier [Chris] Minns, or hopefully Premier Crasuffli. Interestingly \u2026 Premier [Steven] Miles, if he\u2019s re-elect[ed] on the weekend, has said that he will hold some sort of referendum or some sort of vote in Queensland. Presumably he would be bound by that vote so it seems to me, at the moment, that Steven Miles is promising that if there is a vote for the technology for nuclear that he would implement it. [But] there are many other issues that are racing around that have gotten away from the Miles government that people will be voting on and they can vote for a change of government. Asked about the push from Robbie Katter to recriminalise abortion in Queensland, Dutton said he doesn\u2019t think this is a debate that is \u201cshifting votes one way or the other\u201d \u2013 and that people are voting on crime and law and order. O\u2019Neil asked about reports suggesting Liberals seeking to censure Thorpe Clare O\u2019Neil was also asked about reports that senior Liberal MPs are weighing up a move to censure Lidia Thorpe after her actions at King Charles\u2019 parliamentary reception yesterday. Would the government support such a motion? O\u2019Neil said the government would need to \u201csee what the Liberals come forward with specifically\u201d. I would just say one of the things that\u2019s a bit sad about yesterday is that an amazing Ngunnawal elder was there who gave the most generous and beautiful welcome to country at the beginning of the ceremony, and \u2026 as senators and members of parliament, we\u2019ve got lots of ways that we can express and advocate our views and I don\u2019t think what happened yesterday was appropriate. It did take away from the importance of that ceremony, not just for the people in the room but for millions of people around our country who have a great deal of respect for the king and the queen. States need to \u2018come to the party with planning reform\u2019 to achieve housing targets Q: Labor has promised 1.2m homes by the end of the decade \u2013 is that target already out of reach? O\u2019Neil said it was \u201cabsolutely not already out of reach\u201d but \u201cboldness and ambition\u201d is needed. For a long time, the commonwealth government has effectively stepped right out of the role of providing leadership and funding to assist the housing market to function properly in our country, and that is changing under our government \u2026 What we need to see is a galvanising target which gets everyone moving in the right direction. We need the states to come to the party with that planning reform, which is an integral part of the answer to this problem. And you\u2019re starting to see big moves happen around the country here, and not a moment too soon, because we\u2019ve got millions of people whose lives are being affected by this problem. O\u2019Neil welcomes Victorian stamp duty concessions for off-the-plan homes Clare O\u2019Neil was asked about a report from the Business Council that has suggested states and territories replace stamp duty with a land tax, which they say would add to economic growth and preventing stamp duty from disincentivising people from selling their homes. She said this was a \u201creally good idea\u201d because \u201cstamp duty is a bad tax\u201d, preventing people from \u201cmoving around the housing market in the way that suits them best\u201d. We saw an announcement from the Victorian government this week about some changes that they\u2019re making on that. I think it\u2019s great \u2026 One of the reasons that housing is a difficult issue for our country is because \u2026 the three different levels of government all share some responsibility. I\u2019m a commonwealth minister \u2013 I can\u2019t come in and take over the state\u2019s role in this. What we need is good, strong partnerships state, local and commonwealth government working together, and that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re getting under the Albanese government. O\u2019Neil speaks to opposition\u2019s focus on greenfield housing sites The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, is now speaking with ABC RN about the opposition\u2019s housing policy. Asked if there was a divide between the government and opposition over the focus on greenfield sites, O\u2019Neil said \u201cwe need to do both\u201d. Because what we want is, No 1, more housing, because more housing means more affordable housing for all Australians. But No 2, more housing choices \u2013 and we\u2019re going to have different people that want to do and live in different parts of our country. We need to assist with greenfield development, as our government is doing. We also need state governments to step up a bit on planning reform that will enable us to do infill in existing suburbs \u2026 [Young people] would be very happy to live in apartments where they\u2019ve got access to great resources, great transport networks and the life that comes from living in the inner city. And we need to give people options, that\u2019s that\u2019s the answer here. Dutton says \u2018other elements\u2019 of housing policy to be unveiled before election On Saturday, the Coalition unveiled a new housing policy aimed at alleviating the housing crisis \u2013 committing $5bn to develop greenfield sites across the country. The plan promises half a million extra homes over four years. Currently, Australia builds about 160,000 a year, so this means a 74% boost on current numbers. But how realistic is the plan? Dutton told ABC RN it was \u201cvery realistic\u201d and said a number of housing bodies had endorsed the policy. Every economist will tell us that we need to get more supply into the housing market, given the demands that are there, given the population growth, and I believe it\u2019s entirely possible \u2026 There are other elements of the policy that we intend to announce between now and election day. He was asked about how this policy aligns with the Coalition\u2019s plan to cut migration \u2013 Dutton said \u201cwe need to prioritise the people who are coming in to go into the trade\u201d and added: We\u2019ve also been clear about making sure that we can access the workforce that\u2019s readily available here in Australia now, and that is people who have retired early who want to come back into the workforce, but are prevented from doing so because of the run between the welfare system and the tax system. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been speaking with ABC RN about a range of issues \u2013 including Lidia Thorpe\u2019s actions at King Charles\u2019 parliamentary reception yesterday. Dutton argued that \u201csometimes people make it all about themselves, and I think that\u2019s what yesterday was.\u201d He said it \u201cdidn\u2019t advance anyone\u2019s cause\u201d and \u201cadd[s] to the self promotion \u2026 that she seeks.\u201d The vast majority of people have been very welcoming the king\u2019s visit, and I think it\u2019s been an opportunity to underscore the stability in our democracy, our rule of law, separation of powers, all of those institutions that we inherited from our British heritage. That\u2019s part of the success story of our country, and it\u2019s a good reminder during his visit [that] if we change it, I think we want to be very careful about the system we\u2019re changing to and whether or not we would be a safer, more secure, community and environment for decades to come or not. We\u2019ll bring you more from Dutton\u2019s interview in a moment. Nova Peris, a former senator and the first Aboriginal woman in the parliament, says she is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by Lidia Thorpe\u2019s actions during King Charles\u2019 parliamentary reception yesterday. In a post to X, Peris said that the \u201coutburst\u201d was \u201cboth embarrassing and disrespectful to our nation and the Royal Family\u201d, and \u201cdisrupted what should have been a respectful event\u201d. In 2022, Senator Thorpe herself affirmed allegiance to the Crown during her swearing-in ceremony \u2026 If Senator Thorpe was not on board with this, she should not have accepted her position and made her affirmation in the first place. (When Thorpe was sworn in, she was told to repeat the oath of allegiance after she initially described the Queen as a coloniser.) Peris said she has supported the principle Australia should become a republic for two decades, but argued \u201csuch decisions are for the Australian people to make through democratic means\u2014not through rude interruptions or public outbursts\u201d. Australia is moving forward in its journey of reconciliation. As a nation, we are continually recognising the deep injustices faced by Aboriginal people. However, as hard as that journey is, it requires respectful dialogue, mutual understanding, and a shared commitment to healing\u2014not divisive actions that draw attention away from the progress we are making as a country. Late last night, Lidia Thorpe said that her requests to meet with King Charles and discuss her concerns were \u201cignored\u201d. In a post to X, she replied to a British news agency and wrote: I actually put in several requests for a meeting to discuss these issues. Those requests were ignored. It\u2019s not the first time Thorpe has tried to meet with the king. After quitting the Greens party to become an independent in 2023, she told the ABC she would be \u201con the first plane\u201d if she were to be invited to meet the king. She said at the time: I really want to meet with the king. Why not? I am a senator. Surely, I can do that. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties.

As always, you can get in touch with any tips, feedback or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s get started. BHP facing $70bn lawsuit in London As I mentioned at the start, BHP is facing a massive $70bn lawsuit in the high court in London over its handling of the 2015 dam disaster at Mariana. Nineteen people were killed when a tailings dam collapsed, destroying bridges, roads, houses, factories and other commercial premises. Read the full story here: Multiple attacks on gay men spark fears over online homophobic rhetoric More than a dozen attacks on gay men across Australia since July has sparked concern among the LGBTQ+ community. In some cases \u2013 but not all \u2013 police have alleged homophobic comments were made and several of the assaults were filmed. In today\u2019s Full Story, reporter Josh Taylor speaks to Tamsin Rose about concerns some people online are promoting \u201cmethods of attack\u201d and how men are being targeted after agreeing to meetings via apps such as Grindr. Could independents challenge Labor\u2019s Western Sydney stronghold? After more teal success against the Liberals in northern Sydney, Labor\u2019s strongholds in western Sydney could be targeted by independents fired up by the war in Gaza, and the cost-of-living and housing crises. Ahmed Ouf, a pharmacist who emigrated here from Egypt, believes the time has come when \u201csomeone with dark skin, an immigrant, someone from a minority\u201d can challenge for the seat held by education minister, Jason Clare: Labor\u2019s time in western Sydney has run out. Check out the full story by Mostafa Rachwani: Asked if there should be consequences for Lidia Thorpe over her protest, Murray Watt said: Unfortunately what we saw from Lidia Thorpe today is what we see pretty much every week in the Senate. Her and Pauline Hanson \u2026 not a week goes by without the two of them at each other\u2019s throats, disrupting the Senate and to try and grandstand \u2013 and for what? He said he was \u201cin the room when [Thorpe\u2019s protest at the king] happened and was not aware until this very moment [the return of Indigenous artefacts] is the issue she was raising today. I don\u2019t think it worked. I don\u2019t think it got the message through to anyone in the room.\u201d At that point, an audience member shouted: We\u2019re talking about it now, dick. Watt responded: If the idea was to raise the issue with the people who were in the room, I think it failed miserably. Employment minister supportive of returning Indigenous remains from UK but says Thorpe\u2019s protest not \u2018particularly effective\u2019 The ABC\u2019s Q+A program broadcast from Queensland last night, but the election was not the top story. It kicked off with a question from Daniel, a Gureng Gureng man of the Bundaberg region, who echoed Lidia Thorpe\u2019s protest in parliament during the royal visit, with a question about the return of the remains of elders and Indigenous artefacts from the UK. Murray Watt, the minister for employment, said Thorpe\u2019s outburst during the royal tour during which she told the king to \u201cgive us what you stole from us, our bones, our skull, our babies, our people\u201d was not \u201ca particularly effective way of getting her point across\u201d, and said he was supportive of First Nations groups that wanted to regain ancestors\u2019 remains. \u201cAny right-thinking person would acknowledge that\u2019s the right thing to be done,\u201d he said. He added his son had just done a school project on it and he was \u201chappy to take it up within government\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories before Emily Wind takes the controls. A Ngunnawal elder has rebuked Lidia Thorpe over her confrontation with King Charles, saying the Victorian senator doesn\u2019t speak for her people and that her comments were \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. But other First Nations activists are continuing protests against the visit, including trying to a issue the king with a court summons for genocide. The subject came up on the ABC\u2019s Q+A program, with the employment minister, Murray Watt, saying it wasn\u2019t a \u201cparticularly effective way of getting her point across\u201d and he was \u201cin the room when it happened and was not aware until this very moment this is the issue she was raising today\u201d \u2013 at which point an audience member had a heckle of their own to deliver. More on that in a few minutes. We\u2019ll be following the progress of the royal couple today as they continue their visit with a series of engagements in Sydney. Our latest Guardian Essential poll examines the king\u2019s popularity and finds that he has a stronger approval among Australians for the way he is doing his job than either the prime minister or the man who wants to be PM. Taken just ahead of the monarch\u2019s arrival in Australia, the poll of 1,140 voters found that 50% approved of the job Charles is doing as Australia\u2019s head of state, with 26% disapproving and 24% unsure. More coming up. One of Australia\u2019s biggest companies, BHP, has been accused of \u201ccynically and doggedly trying to avoid\u201d responsibility for Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster in a lawsuit involving 620,000 claimants. The huge case concerning the 2015 Mariana disaster \u2013 the largest group lawsuit in English legal history \u2013 began at the high court in London overnight. More coming up.",

      "body": "<p>Wayne Rooney had stolen the show in a 2-0 Manchester United win. The visit of the Premier League champions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/14/manchesterunited.aberdeen\">to Aberdeen in the summer of 2008</a> provided the kind of carnival occasion always guaranteed after Alex Ferguson\u2019s defining move from Pittodrie to Old&nbsp;Trafford. This particular friendly was to mark the 25th anniversary of Ferguson leading Aberdeen to Cup&nbsp;Winners\u2019 Cup glory. Friendly it was \u2026 until post\u2011match media duties.</p> <p>Frank Gilfeather, a household name in the north east, asked Ferguson about the potential impact of Carlos Queiroz\u2019s recently announced exit from United to take over as the Portugal head coach. Ferguson, hitherto unaware Gilfeather was in the room, shot a glance so vengeful it made the four horsemen of the apocalypse look like cartoon characters. After a pause of three seconds \u2013 which felt like three months \u2013 Ferguson answered the question in perfectly articulate terms. As the press conference concluded a group of us dived towards Gilfeather, desperate to know the basis for Ferguson\u2019s extraordinary reaction. Gilfeather had reported throughout Ferguson\u2019s spell in Aberdeen and, it was always assumed, had a decent relationship with the managerial icon.</p> <p>\u201cMichael Crick,\u201d came the reply. \u201cI spoke to Michael Crick for his book.\u201d Indeed Gilfeather did. It was just that Ferguson had not encountered him in the six years between the release of Crick\u2019s book <em>The Boss</em> and that July afternoon. Gilfeather had recounted to Crick that seeking a soundbite from Ferguson for Grampian Television in the early 1980s was seldom a straightforward process.</p> <p>In the book, Gilfeather says: \u201c\u2018The first thing he always asked was: \u2018How much?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Look, Alex, it\u2019s only for a couple of minutes.\u2019 And he\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, well, how much will I&nbsp;get? I get \u00a335 from STV when I do a thing for Scotsport,&nbsp;so how much from you guys?\u2019\u201d </p>    <p>In Ferguson\u2019s latest interaction with directors he has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/15/manchester-united-alex-ferguson-ambassador-role-cuts-ineos-ratcliffe\">stripped of more than \u00a32m a year by United</a> after the club called time on his ambassadorial duties. \u201cSuch a lack of respect,\u201d Eric Cantona screamed. \u201cIt\u2019s totally scandalous.\u201d That this supposedly original-thinking Frenchman knows plenty about lucrative post-football pursuits is demonstrated by his unavoidable presence on betting adverts as you sit down to enjoy Super Sunday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/12/the-ineos-effect-hit-and-miss-as-jim-ratcliffes-tentacles-have-gone-global\">The Ineos Effect: hit and miss as Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s tentacles have gone global</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSir Alex Ferguson should be able to do anything he wants at the club until the day he dies,\u201d Cantona said. Ferguson can \u2013 <em>of course</em> he can \u2013 he just will not be paid a chunky seven figures for the privilege. Rio Ferdinand soon piped up. \u201cNo one is safe,\u201d the former United defender cautioned, ignoring the fact that the sword of Damocles has not dropped on a batch of players floating around the bottom half of the league or a manager who is only ever one game away from a crisis.</p> <p>Those definitely not \u201csafe\u201d from a Jim Ratcliffe\u2011inspired austerity drive are the 250 United employees made redundant as the club looks to claw back \u00a310m a year. The average saving there is \u00a340,000 per head. Staff were told during a 15-minute meeting about the nature of the belt-tightening. At that point, it is actually staggering Ferguson didn\u2019t make a beeline for Ratcliffe (if he had, we would surely have heard about it) and offer to give up his stipend, which has been paid since 2013.</p> <p>It should have been plain that paying a managerial legend close to \u00a3200,000 a month to gladhand and spread the good word of all things United was completely superfluous. That applies to Ferguson as much as to United themselves, who doubtless feared negative headlines from the likes of Cantona if they cut ties with the man who revolutionised their on-field fortunes. What would the young Ferguson, an ardent trade unionist, have made of a scenario where \u00a32m was bestowed on someone who is essentially retired as those on low incomes were deemed dispensable? Ferguson turns 83 in December; it is legitimate to ask whether he thought he could simply receive the United wage in perpetuity or whether this devout socialist has had a form of political reawakening? In Ferguson\u2019s defence, he<strong> </strong>made no fuss over the end of his paid ambassadorial duties.</p> <p>Ferguson insisted in a recent discussion with Ally McCoist that he no longer bothers with tactics or associated detail when attending games. True though that may be, images of him talking to executives as United have burned through coaches since he stepped down sits uneasily with some. Ferguson will still pick up the phone to those at other clubs to protect a manager considered under pressure. Kind in one way, the indicator of somebody who cannot let go in another.</p> <p>Money was integral to a much more high-profile dispute, between Ferguson and fellow owners of Rock of Gibraltar. The fall-out from that eased the Glazer family\u2019s passage into Old Trafford. Ferguson\u2019s pursuit of half of the stud rights from the horse led to him being the victim of a memorable polemic from one Scottish columnist who was once his good friend.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with someone in Ferguson\u2019s position accentuating their own value. This approach did him no harm in his pomp, as the abundance of trophies delivered at Aberdeen and United illustrates. His legacy as one of Britain\u2019s greatest managers is firmly intact.

      "bodyText": "Wayne Rooney had stolen the show in a 2-0 Manchester United win. The visit of the Premier League champions to Aberdeen in the summer of 2008 provided the kind of carnival occasion always guaranteed after Alex Ferguson\u2019s defining move from Pittodrie to Old Trafford. This particular friendly was to mark the 25th anniversary of Ferguson leading Aberdeen to Cup Winners\u2019 Cup glory. Friendly it was \u2026 until post\u2011match media duties. Frank Gilfeather, a household name in the north east, asked Ferguson about the potential impact of Carlos Queiroz\u2019s recently announced exit from United to take over as the Portugal head coach. Ferguson, hitherto unaware Gilfeather was in the room, shot a glance so vengeful it made the four horsemen of the apocalypse look like cartoon characters. After a pause of three seconds \u2013 which felt like three months \u2013 Ferguson answered the question in perfectly articulate terms. As the press conference concluded a group of us dived towards Gilfeather, desperate to know the basis for Ferguson\u2019s extraordinary reaction. Gilfeather had reported throughout Ferguson\u2019s spell in Aberdeen and, it was always assumed, had a decent relationship with the managerial icon. \u201cMichael Crick,\u201d came the reply. \u201cI spoke to Michael Crick for his book.\u201d Indeed Gilfeather did. It was just that Ferguson had not encountered him in the six years between the release of Crick\u2019s book The Boss and that July afternoon. Gilfeather had recounted to Crick that seeking a soundbite from Ferguson for Grampian Television in the early 1980s was seldom a straightforward process. In the book, Gilfeather says: \u201c\u2018The first thing he always asked was: \u2018How much?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Look, Alex, it\u2019s only for a couple of minutes.\u2019 And he\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, well, how much will I get? I get \u00a335 from STV when I do a thing for Scotsport, so how much from you guys?\u2019\u201d In Ferguson\u2019s latest interaction with directors he has been stripped of more than \u00a32m a year by United after the club called time on his ambassadorial duties. \u201cSuch a lack of respect,\u201d Eric Cantona screamed. \u201cIt\u2019s totally scandalous.\u201d That this supposedly original-thinking Frenchman knows plenty about lucrative post-football pursuits is demonstrated by his unavoidable presence on betting adverts as you sit down to enjoy Super Sunday. \u201cSir Alex Ferguson should be able to do anything he wants at the club until the day he dies,\u201d Cantona said. Ferguson can \u2013 of course he can \u2013 he just will not be paid a chunky seven figures for the privilege. Rio Ferdinand soon piped up. \u201cNo one is safe,\u201d the former United defender cautioned, ignoring the fact that the sword of Damocles has not dropped on a batch of players floating around the bottom half of the league or a manager who is only ever one game away from a crisis. Those definitely not \u201csafe\u201d from a Jim Ratcliffe\u2011inspired austerity drive are the 250 United employees made redundant as the club looks to claw back \u00a310m a year. The average saving there is \u00a340,000 per head. Staff were told during a 15-minute meeting about the nature of the belt-tightening. At that point, it is actually staggering Ferguson didn\u2019t make a beeline for Ratcliffe (if he had, we would surely have heard about it) and offer to give up his stipend, which has been paid since 2013. It should have been plain that paying a managerial legend close to \u00a3200,000 a month to gladhand and spread the good word of all things United was completely superfluous. That applies to Ferguson as much as to United themselves, who doubtless feared negative headlines from the likes of Cantona if they cut ties with the man who revolutionised their on-field fortunes. What would the young Ferguson, an ardent trade unionist, have made of a scenario where \u00a32m was bestowed on someone who is essentially retired as those on low incomes were deemed dispensable? Ferguson turns 83 in December; it is legitimate to ask whether he thought he could simply receive the United wage in perpetuity or whether this devout socialist has had a form of political reawakening? In Ferguson\u2019s defence, he made no fuss over the end of his paid ambassadorial duties. Ferguson insisted in a recent discussion with Ally McCoist that he no longer bothers with tactics or associated detail when attending games. True though that may be, images of him talking to executives as United have burned through coaches since he stepped down sits uneasily with some. Ferguson will still pick up the phone to those at other clubs to protect a manager considered under pressure. Kind in one way, the indicator of somebody who cannot let go in another. Money was integral to a much more high-profile dispute, between Ferguson and fellow owners of Rock of Gibraltar. The fall-out from that eased the Glazer family\u2019s passage into Old Trafford. Ferguson\u2019s pursuit of half of the stud rights from the horse led to him being the victim of a memorable polemic from one Scottish columnist who was once his good friend. There is nothing wrong with someone in Ferguson\u2019s position accentuating their own value. This approach did him no harm in his pomp, as the abundance of trophies delivered at Aberdeen and United illustrates. His legacy as one of Britain\u2019s greatest managers is firmly intact. Top Premier League players would not get out of bed for \u00a32m a year. It is merely that the optics behind this situation, which have been exposed only because United decided it was a fiscal excess they could do without, are far from clever. These are times of mediocrity at Old Trafford. Whether Ratcliffe and chums can break that mould remains to be seen. The removal of Ferguson from a formal role is not callous, or even likely to make impact beyond the balance sheet. It just feels unsatisfactory that Ferguson, clearly so conscious of reputation, did not come to this conclusion himself some time ago. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Kent, like so many councils in deep debt, is burning through its reserves: this is just one example of the last government\u2019s continuing legacy, as council cuts will go on. Jim Duncan, director of Seashells, working here since its 2002 opening, is heartbroken at all that will be lost to this community.

Those fleeing domestic violence know they get help here. The food bank and food pantry stop local children going hungry. Parents can get advice on education, employment, benefits and budgeting. There are fun days, outings and parties for families that can afford few treats, with swimming lessons at the local pool and secondhand clothes swaps.

But she never lets the words \u201cSure Start\u201d pass her lips, though I have visited the best of them with her.

      "body": "<p>A senior member of the family that has dominated Singapore since independence has been granted asylum in the UK after fleeing what he says was a campaign of persecution.</p> <p>In an exclusive interview, Lee Hsien Yang told the Guardian the authoritarian regime founded by his father turned on him as he endorsed the opposition following a family rift.</p> <p>\u201cDespite the very advanced economic prosperity that Singapore has, there\u2019s a dark side to it, that the government is repressive,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat people think, that this is some kind of paradise \u2013 it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Under the rule of his brother, who was prime minister for 20 years until May, Lee Hsien Yang claims the authorities used what he called baseless allegations against him, his wife and his son to bring a series of legal actions. These \u201cescalated to the point where I believe for my own personal safety I should not continue to live in Singapore\u201d.</p> <p>In a system that brooks little dissent, a ruling elite that prides itself on its reputation for probity is rarely denounced so thoroughly \u2013 especially by one of its own.</p> <p>Singapore\u2019s financial system has in recent years repeatedly played a part in international <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-66840450\">corruption scandals</a>. Lee Hsien Yang said: \u201cPeople need to look beyond Singapore\u2019s bold, false assertions and see what the reality really is like.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere is a need for the world to look more closely, to see Singapore\u2019s role as that key facilitator for arms trades, for dirty money, for drug monies, crypto money.\u201d</p> <p>A Singapore government spokesperson said the country had \u201ca robust system to deter and tackle money laundering and other illicit financial flows\u201d, pointing to its favourable <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023\">ranking</a> in Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception index, well above the UK.</p> <p>Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said: \u201cAs Britain knows all too well, countries can look like they don\u2019t have a domestic corruption problem yet still play a key role in enabling corrupt networks elsewhere. Singapore\u2019s regional role as a major financial hub makes it attractive to those seeking to move or hide illicit funds, especially from a relatively high-risk neighbourhood.\u201d</p> <p>It was Lee Hsien Yang\u2019s father, Lee Kuan Yew, who transformed Singapore from its volatile origins in poverty and joblessness into an economic powerhouse. As prime minister from 1959, he secured the former British colony\u2019s independence.</p> <p>But his rule also brought the jailing of hundreds of opposition figures, the curtailment of press and social freedoms, and the establishment of effective one-party rule. He has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/lee-kuan-yew-singapores-long-time-leader/2015/03/22/47d34c2e-ce60-11e4-8c54-ffb5ba6f2f69_story.html\">described as</a><strong> </strong>\u201cthe democratic world\u2019s favourite dictator\u201d.</p> <p>After he stepped down in 1990, he retained significant influence as senior minister until 2004. That year, his eldest child, Lee Hsien Loong, became prime minister, holding the position for two decades until this May. Like his father, he has ensured continued sway by taking the role of senior minister in the cabinet. The techniques of control may be subtler but Human Rights Watch still <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/asia/singapore\">describes the country as</a> \u201coverwhelmingly repressive\u201d.</p> <p>That view is shared by the founding father\u2019s younger son. After studying at Cambridge, Lee Hsien Yang served in the military, retiring as a brigadier, then took leadership positions at some of Singapore\u2019s biggest private companies.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian in the UK, where he is now officially a refugee, he said: \u201cWhat\u2019s sad is Singapore puts out this facade which is very shiny and it says we are very good with rule of law, we have developed society. And yet at the core we retain these repressive measures. And many of them did come from the time my father was prime minister and from the time it was a British colony.\u201d</p> <p>The patriarch\u2019s death in 2015 triggered a family rift over what to do with his home. Disdainful of monuments to dead leaders, Lee Kuan Yew had long said he wanted it demolished once his daughter no longer lived there. She accepted this, as did Lee Hsien Yang.</p> <p>But Lee Hsien Loong, then prime minister, claimed their father had been open to the government deciding what to do with the house. He says he has recused himself from matters relating to the house.</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear that the current generation [of leaders] will try very hard to create attachments to Lee Kuan Yew,\u201d said Sudhir Vadaketh, the editor of Jom, a weekly magazine on Singapore. \u201cLee Kuan Yew is the golden goose of legitimacy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Get%20in%20touch&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Atom.burgis%40theguardian.com%22%3Etom.burgis%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.me%2F%23p%2F%2B447721857348%22%3ESignal%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447721857348%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207721%20857348.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Get in touch\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Get%20in%20touch&description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Atom.burgis%40theguardian.com%22%3Etom.burgis%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.me%2F%23p%2F%2B447721857348%22%3ESignal%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447721857348%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207721%20857348.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&link=false\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The disagreement over the house escalated into a series of legal proceedings. In 2017, Lee Hsien Yang\u2019s son was accused of \u201cscandalising the judiciary\u201d over comments made on Facebook in which he said that Singapore had a \u201cpliant court system\u201d. He was fined 15,000 Singapore dollars. In 2018, Singapore\u2019s attorney general filed disciplinary action against Lee Hsien Yang\u2019s wife, Lee Suet Fern, a successful corporate lawyer. She was accused of acting improperly in relation to her father-in-law\u2019s will and suspended for 15 months. The couple are also under investigation for alleged perjury.</p> <p>In 2020, Lee Hsien Yang joined an opposition party. He told the Guardian he believed the current allegations were politically motivated attempts to destroy him. He also said he had been among the targets of Singapore\u2019s \u201cvery extensive surveillance system\u201d. He was granted asylum in August, two years after leaving Singapore for the UK. \u201cI think it is an acknowledgment that Singapore has been persecuting me,\u201d Lee Hsien Yang said.</p> <p>Asked about his brother\u2019s role, he said: \u201cIn my opinion, in a tightly controlled country like Singapore, these kinds of actions could not have happened without the agreement and acquiescence of Lee Hsien Loong.\u201d</p> <p>The government spokesperson said Lee Hsien Yang and his family \u201care and have always been free to return to Singapore\u201d. Allegations that they are victims of \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cunfounded\u201d persecution were itself without basis, the spokesperson said. \u201cThe legal findings [against Lee Hsien Yang] are amply supported by well-documented and public findings of an independent judiciary.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesperson added: \u201cIn Singapore, no one is above the law. Anyone, including the offspring of the founding prime minister \u2026 can be investigated and brought before the courts.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A senior member of the family that has dominated Singapore since independence has been granted asylum in the UK after fleeing what he says was a campaign of persecution. In an exclusive interview, Lee Hsien Yang told the Guardian the authoritarian regime founded by his father turned on him as he endorsed the opposition following a family rift. \u201cDespite the very advanced economic prosperity that Singapore has, there\u2019s a dark side to it, that the government is repressive,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat people think, that this is some kind of paradise \u2013 it isn\u2019t.\u201d Under the rule of his brother, who was prime minister for 20 years until May, Lee Hsien Yang claims the authorities used what he called baseless allegations against him, his wife and his son to bring a series of legal actions. These \u201cescalated to the point where I believe for my own personal safety I should not continue to live in Singapore\u201d. In a system that brooks little dissent, a ruling elite that prides itself on its reputation for probity is rarely denounced so thoroughly \u2013 especially by one of its own. Singapore\u2019s financial system has in recent years repeatedly played a part in international corruption scandals. Lee Hsien Yang said: \u201cPeople need to look beyond Singapore\u2019s bold, false assertions and see what the reality really is like.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is a need for the world to look more closely, to see Singapore\u2019s role as that key facilitator for arms trades, for dirty money, for drug monies, crypto money.\u201d A Singapore government spokesperson said the country had \u201ca robust system to deter and tackle money laundering and other illicit financial flows\u201d, pointing to its favourable ranking in Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception index, well above the UK. Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said: \u201cAs Britain knows all too well, countries can look like they don\u2019t have a domestic corruption problem yet still play a key role in enabling corrupt networks elsewhere. Singapore\u2019s regional role as a major financial hub makes it attractive to those seeking to move or hide illicit funds, especially from a relatively high-risk neighbourhood.\u201d It was Lee Hsien Yang\u2019s father, Lee Kuan Yew, who transformed Singapore from its volatile origins in poverty and joblessness into an economic powerhouse. As prime minister from 1959, he secured the former British colony\u2019s independence. But his rule also brought the jailing of hundreds of opposition figures, the curtailment of press and social freedoms, and the establishment of effective one-party rule. He has been described as \u201cthe democratic world\u2019s favourite dictator\u201d. After he stepped down in 1990, he retained significant influence as senior minister until 2004. That year, his eldest child, Lee Hsien Loong, became prime minister, holding the position for two decades until this May. Like his father, he has ensured continued sway by taking the role of senior minister in the cabinet. The techniques of control may be subtler but Human Rights Watch still describes the country as \u201coverwhelmingly repressive\u201d. That view is shared by the founding father\u2019s younger son. After studying at Cambridge, Lee Hsien Yang served in the military, retiring as a brigadier, then took leadership positions at some of Singapore\u2019s biggest private companies. Speaking to the Guardian in the UK, where he is now officially a refugee, he said: \u201cWhat\u2019s sad is Singapore puts out this facade which is very shiny and it says we are very good with rule of law, we have developed society. And yet at the core we retain these repressive measures. And many of them did come from the time my father was prime minister and from the time it was a British colony.\u201d The patriarch\u2019s death in 2015 triggered a family rift over what to do with his home. Disdainful of monuments to dead leaders, Lee Kuan Yew had long said he wanted it demolished once his daughter no longer lived there. She accepted this, as did Lee Hsien Yang. But Lee Hsien Loong, then prime minister, claimed their father had been open to the government deciding what to do with the house. He says he has recused himself from matters relating to the house. \u201cIt is clear that the current generation [of leaders] will try very hard to create attachments to Lee Kuan Yew,\u201d said Sudhir Vadaketh, the editor of Jom, a weekly magazine on Singapore. \u201cLee Kuan Yew is the golden goose of legitimacy.\u201d The disagreement over the house escalated into a series of legal proceedings. In 2017, Lee Hsien Yang\u2019s son was accused of \u201cscandalising the judiciary\u201d over comments made on Facebook in which he said that Singapore had a \u201cpliant court system\u201d. He was fined 15,000 Singapore dollars. In 2018, Singapore\u2019s attorney general filed disciplinary action against Lee Hsien Yang\u2019s wife, Lee Suet Fern, a successful corporate lawyer. She was accused of acting improperly in relation to her father-in-law\u2019s will and suspended for 15 months. The couple are also under investigation for alleged perjury. In 2020, Lee Hsien Yang joined an opposition party. He told the Guardian he believed the current allegations were politically motivated attempts to destroy him. He also said he had been among the targets of Singapore\u2019s \u201cvery extensive surveillance system\u201d. He was granted asylum in August, two years after leaving Singapore for the UK. \u201cI think it is an acknowledgment that Singapore has been persecuting me,\u201d Lee Hsien Yang said. Asked about his brother\u2019s role, he said: \u201cIn my opinion, in a tightly controlled country like Singapore, these kinds of actions could not have happened without the agreement and acquiescence of Lee Hsien Loong.\u201d The government spokesperson said Lee Hsien Yang and his family \u201care and have always been free to return to Singapore\u201d. Allegations that they are victims of \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cunfounded\u201d persecution were itself without basis, the spokesperson said. \u201cThe legal findings [against Lee Hsien Yang] are amply supported by well-documented and public findings of an independent judiciary.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cIn Singapore, no one is above the law. Anyone, including the offspring of the founding prime minister \u2026 can be investigated and brought before the courts.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Disgraced Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein has been diagnosed with a form of bone marrow cancer, according to NBC News and ABC News, which both cited anonymous sources. The 72-year-old former entertainment mogul has chronic myeloid leukemia and is undergoing treatment in a New York prison, the US outlets reported on Monday. Weinstein\u2019s authorised healthcare representative in New York, Craig Rothfeld, declined to comment, telling ABC: \u201cOut of respect for Mr Weinstein\u2019s privacy, we will offer no further comment.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s spokesperson Juda Engelmayer told Variety that Rothfeld \u201cexpresses profound dismay at the speculation surrounding Mr Weinstein\u2019s medical condition\u201d. \u201cIt is both troubling and unacceptable that such private and confidential health matters have become a subject of public discourse. Out of respect for Mr Weinstein\u2019s privacy, we will offer no further comment,\u201d Engelmayer added. Weinstein\u2019s reported diagnosis comes a month after he was indicted on a new sex crime charge. He pleaded not guilty to one count of criminal sex act in the first degree in a New York court, relating to an allegation that he sexually assaulted a woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006. Weinstein also underwent emergency heart surgery last month, after which his representative said he was \u201cout of danger at the moment\u201d. Weinstein is serving a 16-year prison sentence after being convicted on rape charges in California. He was also convicted in New York in 2020 of the rape and sexual assault of an actress and of forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant, and was sentenced to 23 years in prison in that case. However, a New York appeals court overturned the verdict in April, ruling that the trial judge had allowed testimony in error from accusers who were not directly involved with the charges facing Weinstein. A retrial in the case had been aimed for November, though prosecutors had deemed that \u201cunrealistic\u201d. Allegations against Weinstein helped launch the MeToo movement in 2017, a watershed moment for women fighting sexual misconduct. More than 80 women accused him of harassment, sexual assault or rape, including prominent actors Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd. Weinstein has claimed any sexual relations in question were consensual. In 1979, Weinstein and his brother Bob co-founded prominent Hollywood film studio Miramax Films. Their hits included 1994\u2019s Pulp Fiction and 1998\u2019s Shakespeare in Love, for which Weinstein shared a best picture Oscar. Agence-France Presse contributed to this report.",

      "body": "<p>Alexei Navalny was watching his favourite cartoon show, Rick and Morty, when he suddenly felt unwell. He was 21 minutes into an episode where Rick turns into a pickle. The late Russian opposition leader was&nbsp;on a flight back to Moscow after campaigning ahead of regional elections in the Siberian city of Tomsk in August 2020. Something was clearly wrong, and Navalny staggered to the&nbsp;bathroom.</p> <p>There, he recalls, he had the grim realisation: \u201cI\u2019m done for.\u201d He told a&nbsp;sceptical steward that he\u2019d been poisoned and then lay down calmly in the aisle, facing a wall. Life didn\u2019t flash before his eyes. Instead, he compares his experience of death \u2013 or near-death, as it turned out \u2013 to something from a dark fantasy. It was like being \u201ckissed by a Dementor and a Nazg\u00fbl stands nearby\u201d.</p> <p>He is clear who gave the order to kill him with the nerve agent novichok: Vladimir Putin. Navalny calls Russia\u2019s president a \u201cbribe-taking old man\u201d and a \u201cvengeful runt\u201d who sits on top of a \u201csinister regime\u201d. The assassins were members of the FSB, the KGB\u2019s successor agency. Navalny spent 18 days in a coma, waking up in hospital in Germany.</p> <p>It was while recovering in Freiburg that he wrote the first part of his extraordinary memoir, Patriot. The second section consists of letters from prison, following his January 2021 return to Moscow, when he was dramatically arrested at the airport. Navalny says he embarked on an autobiography knowing the Kremlin could finish him off. \u201cIf they do finally whack me, this book will be my memorial,\u201d he notes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Critics regard Navalny as a closet nationalist. But Patriot calls for Russia to withdraw its troops, respect Ukraine\u2019s 1991 borders and pay compensation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It took three years for his gallows humour prophecy to come true. Navalny died in February this year, his&nbsp;likely murder taking place in an Arctic penal colony. He was 47. Prison documents hint he was poisoned and the authorities removed the evidence: clothes, vomit, even snow he had come into contact with.</p> <p>This is a brave and brilliant book, a&nbsp;luminous account of Navalny\u2019s life and dark times. It is a challenge from beyond the grave to Russia\u2019s murder-addicted rulers. You can hear his voice in the deft translation by Arch Tait and Stephen Dalziel: sharp, playful and lacking in self-pity. Nothing crushes him. Up until the end \u2013 his final \u201cpolar\u201d entry is on 17 January 2024 \u2013 he&nbsp;radiates indomitable good humour.</p> <p>Patriot includes a manifesto for how the country might be transformed: free elections, a constitutional assembly, decentralisation and a European orientation. Days before his murder, he predicted the Putin regime would crumble, while acknowledging the resilience of autocracies.</p> <p>Trained as a lawyer, Navalny first attracted attention as a transparency activist. He bought shares in notoriously corrupt oil and gas companies and asked awkward questions at shareholder meetings. The Kremlin controlled TV and most newspapers, so Navalny wrote up his <a href=\"https://navalny-en.livejournal.com/\">expos\u00e9s online</a>. In 2011 he founded <a href=\"https://fbk.info/en\">FBK</a>, an anti-corruption organisation which grew into a grassroots national movement run by volunteers. He expresses pride at the way his campaigns encouraged young Russians to take part in opposition politics. Police detained him for the first time in 2011 when he attended protests against rigged Duma elections. Undaunted, he stood two years later to be mayor of Moscow, coming second, before finding himself in an \u201cendless cycle\u201d of rallies, arrests and spells in custody.</p> <p>The Kremlin\u2019s response to all this was vicious. His brother Oleg was jailed after a fake trial, a provocateur threw green gunk at Navalny, blinding him in one eye. In 2016 he tried to run for president. His videos \u2013 of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI\">Putin\u2019s tacky Sochi palace</a> and former president <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_GF9g\">Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s dodgy schemes</a> \u2013 attracted millions of views. Navalny writes movingly about his wife, Yulia, \u2013 whom he met on holiday in Turkey \u2013 as a soulmate throughout this period.</p> <p>Given his understanding of Putin\u2019s Stalinist methods, why did he return to Moscow? His answer is that the struggle to make Russia a normal state&nbsp;was \u201cmy life\u2019s work\u201d. He wasn\u2019t prepared to dump his homeland or his convictions, he says. At first, jail conditions were bearable. Well-wishers sent sacks of letters and a tiramisu cake. In one dispatch, Navalny ponders the \u201camazing ability of human beings to adapt and derive pleasure from the most trivial things\u201d, such as instant coffee.</p> <p>Behind bars, he chatted to his cellmates and read. He preferred Maupassant to Flaubert and enjoyed Oliver Twist (though he wonders if Dickens got working-class dialogue right). The FSB spied on him 24/7; his warders wore body cameras and barked commands.</p> <p>As conditions worsened, he made fewer diary entries. More criminal \u201cconvictions\u201d piled up \u2013 for&nbsp;insulting a war veteran and for extremism. He was shuffled from one penitentiary to the next. Meanwhile, \u201cperverted\u201d prison staff refused to treat his back pain, prompting a hunger strike. He was categorised as a&nbsp;flight risk and woken throughout the night, put in a tiny punishment cell and denied his wife\u2019s letters.</p> <p>None of these privations stopped Navalny from denouncing Putin\u2019s all-out invasion of Ukraine as an \u201cunjust war of aggression\u201d. The reason for the war is Putin\u2019s desire to hold on to power at any cost, and an obsession with his \u201chistorical legacy\u201d, he writes. Critics regard Navalny as a closet nationalist. But Patriot calls for Russia to withdraw its troops, respect Ukraine\u2019s 1991 borders and pay compensation.</p> <p>During one of Yulia\u2019s visits, Navalny told her there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d he would never get out of prison alive. \u201cThey will poison me,\u201d he said. \u201cI&nbsp;know,\u201d she replied. He sketches out what this means \u2013 no chance to say goodbye, never meeting his grandchildren, \u201ctasseled mortar boards tossed in the air in my absence\u201d. Maybe an unmarked grave. His philosophy: hope for the best, expect the worst. His death is a terrible loss, for Russia and for all of us.</p> <ul> <li><p>Luke Harding\u2019s Invasion: Russia\u2019s Bloody War and Ukraine\u2019s Fight for Survival is published by Guardian Faber (\u00a310.99).

The late Russian opposition leader was on a flight back to Moscow after campaigning ahead of regional elections in the Siberian city of Tomsk in August 2020. Something was clearly wrong, and Navalny staggered to the bathroom. There, he recalls, he had the grim realisation: \u201cI\u2019m done for.\u201d He told a sceptical steward that he\u2019d been poisoned and then lay down calmly in the aisle, facing a wall. Life didn\u2019t flash before his eyes. Instead, he compares his experience of death \u2013 or near-death, as it turned out \u2013 to something from a dark fantasy. It was like being \u201ckissed by a Dementor and a Nazg\u00fbl stands nearby\u201d. He is clear who gave the order to kill him with the nerve agent novichok: Vladimir Putin. Navalny calls Russia\u2019s president a \u201cbribe-taking old man\u201d and a \u201cvengeful runt\u201d who sits on top of a \u201csinister regime\u201d. The assassins were members of the FSB, the KGB\u2019s successor agency. Navalny spent 18 days in a coma, waking up in hospital in Germany. It was while recovering in Freiburg that he wrote the first part of his extraordinary memoir, Patriot. The second section consists of letters from prison, following his January 2021 return to Moscow, when he was dramatically arrested at the airport. Navalny says he embarked on an autobiography knowing the Kremlin could finish him off. \u201cIf they do finally whack me, this book will be my memorial,\u201d he notes. It took three years for his gallows humour prophecy to come true. Navalny died in February this year, his likely murder taking place in an Arctic penal colony. He was 47. Prison documents hint he was poisoned and the authorities removed the evidence: clothes, vomit, even snow he had come into contact with. This is a brave and brilliant book, a luminous account of Navalny\u2019s life and dark times. It is a challenge from beyond the grave to Russia\u2019s murder-addicted rulers. You can hear his voice in the deft translation by Arch Tait and Stephen Dalziel: sharp, playful and lacking in self-pity. Nothing crushes him. Up until the end \u2013 his final \u201cpolar\u201d entry is on 17 January 2024 \u2013 he radiates indomitable good humour. Patriot includes a manifesto for how the country might be transformed: free elections, a constitutional assembly, decentralisation and a European orientation. Days before his murder, he predicted the Putin regime would crumble, while acknowledging the resilience of autocracies. Trained as a lawyer, Navalny first attracted attention as a transparency activist. He bought shares in notoriously corrupt oil and gas companies and asked awkward questions at shareholder meetings. The Kremlin controlled TV and most newspapers, so Navalny wrote up his expos\u00e9s online. In 2011 he founded FBK, an anti-corruption organisation which grew into a grassroots national movement run by volunteers. He expresses pride at the way his campaigns encouraged young Russians to take part in opposition politics. Police detained him for the first time in 2011 when he attended protests against rigged Duma elections. Undaunted, he stood two years later to be mayor of Moscow, coming second, before finding himself in an \u201cendless cycle\u201d of rallies, arrests and spells in custody. The Kremlin\u2019s response to all this was vicious. His brother Oleg was jailed after a fake trial, a provocateur threw green gunk at Navalny, blinding him in one eye. In 2016 he tried to run for president. His videos \u2013 of Putin\u2019s tacky Sochi palace and former president Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s dodgy schemes \u2013 attracted millions of views. Navalny writes movingly about his wife, Yulia, \u2013 whom he met on holiday in Turkey \u2013 as a soulmate throughout this period. Given his understanding of Putin\u2019s Stalinist methods, why did he return to Moscow? His answer is that the struggle to make Russia a normal state was \u201cmy life\u2019s work\u201d. He wasn\u2019t prepared to dump his homeland or his convictions, he says. At first, jail conditions were bearable. Well-wishers sent sacks of letters and a tiramisu cake. In one dispatch, Navalny ponders the \u201camazing ability of human beings to adapt and derive pleasure from the most trivial things\u201d, such as instant coffee. Behind bars, he chatted to his cellmates and read. He preferred Maupassant to Flaubert and enjoyed Oliver Twist (though he wonders if Dickens got working-class dialogue right). The FSB spied on him 24/7; his warders wore body cameras and barked commands. As conditions worsened, he made fewer diary entries. More criminal \u201cconvictions\u201d piled up \u2013 for insulting a war veteran and for extremism. He was shuffled from one penitentiary to the next. Meanwhile, \u201cperverted\u201d prison staff refused to treat his back pain, prompting a hunger strike. He was categorised as a flight risk and woken throughout the night, put in a tiny punishment cell and denied his wife\u2019s letters. None of these privations stopped Navalny from denouncing Putin\u2019s all-out invasion of Ukraine as an \u201cunjust war of aggression\u201d. The reason for the war is Putin\u2019s desire to hold on to power at any cost, and an obsession with his \u201chistorical legacy\u201d, he writes. Critics regard Navalny as a closet nationalist. But Patriot calls for Russia to withdraw its troops, respect Ukraine\u2019s 1991 borders and pay compensation. During one of Yulia\u2019s visits, Navalny told her there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d he would never get out of prison alive. \u201cThey will poison me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know,\u201d she replied. He sketches out what this means \u2013 no chance to say goodbye, never meeting his grandchildren, \u201ctasseled mortar boards tossed in the air in my absence\u201d. Maybe an unmarked grave. His philosophy: hope for the best, expect the worst. His death is a terrible loss, for Russia and for all of us.

Eckhart plays a hitman named Evan Shaw; clearly a bit of a dolt, Shaw thinks he works for a super-specialised unit within the CIA that dispatches him to assassinate bad guys by sending him coded messages in the classified ads in newspapers (very retro). Shaw never sees his boss, Kevin (Tim Roth, clearly not taking this seriously) although a flashback reveals they used to have dinner together once in a while. Still grieving his late wife, Monica (Marysia S Peres, also seen in flashbacks), Shaw devotes himself to his lonely, murderous work, passing through airports, picking up suitcases with high calibre rifles at lost property offices, killing folks and then unwinding in hotel bars before moving on to the next gig.</p> <p>In one such bar, a young woman named Kacey (Abigail Breslin, the wee girl from Little Miss Sunshine, now all grownup) makes eye contact, but it turns out she\u2019s not looking for a hook-up as Shaw thinks. She explains that she too is from a spy agency and has some shocking news: he is not working for the CIA, Kevin is dead, and whoever is leaving messages for him in the papers is using him to kill their enemies for their own reasons. At first, Shaw refuses to believe he\u2019s the equivalent of the second world war Japanese soldier who was stranded on an island and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroo_Onoda\">didn\u2019t surrender until 1974</a>. But some cursory internet searches reveal she might be telling the truth, so Shaw and Kacey team up and head to Malta for answers \u2013 as well as to allow the film-makers a chance to avail themselves of the island\u2019s honey-coloured locations.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klTtuOaNdG4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/klTtuOaNdG4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Roel Rein\u00e9, whose credits include loads of D-list titles on which he\u2019s done various jobs, not only directs here but also operates the camera and composes the music (the latter a series of anonymous, featureless drones and synthesised strings with drumbeats that barely complement the action). The fight sequences are lethargic and feature a lot of extras waiting patiently for their cue to fall over dead. The Maltese architecture remains as lovely as ever; the dialogue is, however, shockingly bad.</p> <p>\u2022 Classified is on digital platforms from 28 October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This decidedly shonky, if at least relatively unpretentious, action film stars Aaron Eckhart, once very much the coming man who\u2019s not had the career you would expect for someone with his looks and talent. Eckhart plays a hitman named Evan Shaw; clearly a bit of a dolt, Shaw thinks he works for a super-specialised unit within the CIA that dispatches him to assassinate bad guys by sending him coded messages in the classified ads in newspapers (very retro). Shaw never sees his boss, Kevin (Tim Roth, clearly not taking this seriously) although a flashback reveals they used to have dinner together once in a while. Still grieving his late wife, Monica (Marysia S Peres, also seen in flashbacks), Shaw devotes himself to his lonely, murderous work, passing through airports, picking up suitcases with high calibre rifles at lost property offices, killing folks and then unwinding in hotel bars before moving on to the next gig. In one such bar, a young woman named Kacey (Abigail Breslin, the wee girl from Little Miss Sunshine, now all grownup) makes eye contact, but it turns out she\u2019s not looking for a hook-up as Shaw thinks. She explains that she too is from a spy agency and has some shocking news: he is not working for the CIA, Kevin is dead, and whoever is leaving messages for him in the papers is using him to kill their enemies for their own reasons. At first, Shaw refuses to believe he\u2019s the equivalent of the second world war Japanese soldier who was stranded on an island and didn\u2019t surrender until 1974. But some cursory internet searches reveal she might be telling the truth, so Shaw and Kacey team up and head to Malta for answers \u2013 as well as to allow the film-makers a chance to avail themselves of the island\u2019s honey-coloured locations. Roel Rein\u00e9, whose credits include loads of D-list titles on which he\u2019s done various jobs, not only directs here but also operates the camera and composes the music (the latter a series of anonymous, featureless drones and synthesised strings with drumbeats that barely complement the action). The fight sequences are lethargic and feature a lot of extras waiting patiently for their cue to fall over dead. The Maltese architecture remains as lovely as ever; the dialogue is, however, shockingly bad. \u2022 Classified is on digital platforms from 28 October.",

      "bodyText": "Speculation is intensifying that next week\u2019s budget could include sweeping changes to inheritance tax designed to raise billions of pounds. Only about one in 20 UK estates now attract inheritance tax (IHT), but it is a topic that always arouses strong feelings. Some thinktanks say there are loopholes in the rules that allow the well-off to avoid paying their fair share and which need to be closed, while others such as the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance have urged Rachel Reeves to rule out increasing this \u201chated death tax\u201d. What is inheritance tax? Put simply, it is a tax paid on someone\u2019s assets (property, possessions and money) after they die, but only if they leave enough to go above a certain threshold. The standard IHT rate is 40%, and it is only charged on the part of the estate that is above the tax-free threshold, which is now \u00a3325,000. However, the rules are complex: there are various tax-free allowances and reliefs, plus exemptions for things such as agricultural land, businesses, shares in companies listed on the Aim stock market and pensions. These will often minimise the IHT bill or mean there is nothing to pay. Who pays it? In the 2021-22 tax year, 27,800 deaths resulted in an IHT bill, which was 4.39% of all UK deaths that year. The tax raised \u00a35.99bn that year. However, the main IHT threshold has been frozen at \u00a3325,000 since 2009 and is due to stay at that level until at least April 2028, so rising house prices and the increasing value of people\u2019s investments and other assets are gradually pulling more people into the IHT net \u2013 a phenomenon known as fiscal drag. In 2023-24, the government raked in a record \u00a37.5bn from the tax. The average amount of IHT paid by all taxpaying estates in 2021-22 was \u00a3215,000, but that was pulled up a lot by the bills imposed on the very wealthiest estates. And despite the headline rate being 40%, the various allowances and other ways of bringing down the liability mean the average rate paid by those affected in 2021-22 was actually a third of that: 13%. This may help explain why some of those backing a shake-up believe there are billions that can be raised by making changes to the system. What might the chancellor do? Reeves could make changes to the various exemptions, allowances and reliefs currently available: for example, the tax breaks relating to spouses and civil partners. You can leave your home to your spouse or civil partner when you die, and there is no IHT to pay. However, there is also something called the residence nil-rate band (RNRB) \u2013 currently \u00a3175,000 \u2013 that can bump up the tax-free threshold if you leave your home to your children or grandchildren. It all means that, now, a married couple can leave their estate to each other when the first person dies in the knowledge that when their partner dies, up to \u00a31m can be passed on tax-free to their offspring (this \u00a31m is made up of two lots of the main \u00a3325,000 allowance \u2013 one for each individual \u2013 plus two lots of the \u00a3175,000 RNRB allowance). Official figures show that in 2021-22, \u00a315.5bn was transferred to surviving spouses and civil partners on death \u2013 the biggest IHT tax break on the books, said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. She added: \u201cIf this was changed, instead of the surviving partner being able to give away up to \u00a31m free of inheritance tax, they might be limited to \u00a3500,000.\u201d Given that the average house in London was now worth more than that, \u201cit could push the average Londoner into the realms of tax\u201d. What about gifts? Yes, there is a lot of speculation that the government may tighten up the rules on \u201cgifts\u201d. For example, while you are alive, you have a \u00a33,000 gift allowance a year. This is known as your annual exemption and means you can give away assets or cash up to a total of \u00a33,000 in a tax year without it being added to the value of your estate for IHT purposes. Meanwhile, the \u201cpotentially exempt transfer\u201d rules allow someone to give money or gifts of any amount/value to anyone which will become exempt from IHT as long as they live for seven years after giving them. If the giver dies within the seven years and there is tax to pay, the amount due depends on when they gave it \u2013 for example, gifts within three years of death are taxed at 40%. There has been a lot of speculation that the government could, for example, extend the seven years to 10 years. Changes to this regime \u201ccould mean more people receiving gifts and then being stung with a tax bill far further down the line, when they may not have any of the gift left to cover the tax bill\u201d, said Coles. The government might tighten the rules by taxing gifts over a certain size or introducing a \u201clifetime limit\u201d on gifts, said Paul Barham, partner and head of international private client tax at Forvis Mazars. What about investors? There is talk about a possible change to the rules relating to Aim investments. Many people in the UK who have invested in smaller companies \u2013 which involves more risk \u2013 are making use of the current rules that allow 100% relief from IHT on Aim market shares held for at least two years. \u201cAim could be excluded from the exemption altogether, the rate of relief could be cut, or the holding period could be increased,\u201d said Coles. It has been suggested that removing this tax break could raise more than \u00a31bn a year. Who else might be affected by any changes? There have been claims the government is planning an IHT \u201craid\u201d on UK family farms, and is considering scrapping a valuable relief which allows landowners to pass down farms to their children free. Business property relief and agricultural property relief are tax breaks that can reduce the value of the assets for IHT purposes by up to 100%. In 2021-22, business property relief was used by 4,170 estates to shelter \u00a32.9bn worth of assets from IHT, while agricultural property relief was used by 1,730 estates to shelter \u00a31.6bn worth of assets. \u201cAt present, each of these reliefs is uncapped, but the government could seek to introduce a cap on the maximum amount of asset value that each relief can be claimed against, meaning any value above this threshold would be subject to the standard 40% IHT rate,\u201d said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at investment platform interactive investor. Would any changes to IHT affect pensions? At the moment, pensions tend to be outside people\u2019s estates for IHT purposes. However, there is speculation that changes are being considered. Making pensions subject to IHT or a levy on death \u201chas the potential to drag many more people into the taxpaying net and raise some serious revenue for government\u201d, said Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown.",

      "body": "<p>While Europe may be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/21/europe-welcome-threat-eu-far-right-refugees\">sleepwalking into a far-right trap</a>\u201d, Austria is consciously walking straight into it. After all, polls had predicted the most recent electoral success of the Austrian Freedom party (FP\u00d6) for almost two years. While the far-right party\u2019s leader, Herbert Kickl, heralded its victory as the beginning of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/far-right-freedom-party-winning-austrian-election-first-results-show\">a new era</a>\u201d, it is better understood as a seemingly unavoidable progression. If anything, the country\u2019s recent election results confirmed a broader pattern of far-right normalisation in Europe in general and in Austria in particular.</p> <p>Although 29% was indeed its best result ever in a nationwide election, the FP\u00d6 has consistently achieved results in the <a href=\"https://www.jede-stimme.at/wahlen/analyse?ebene=Nationalrat\">double digits</a> since 1990, has been included in the national government multiple times, and currently governs in several states with the conservative Austrian People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP). After the most recent state election in Vorarlberg, the \u00d6VP is about to form its <a href=\"https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000241112/vorarlberg-wahl-oevp-und-fpoe-starten-am-montag-koalitionsgespraeche\">fourth regional coalition</a> with the FP\u00d6 there. As such, Austria is a perfect example of the dangerous shortsightedness of normalising far-right parties \u2013 a process led in the 21st century by, above all, conservative parties.</p> <p>It started as a way to strengthen its own power, but the \u00d6VP\u2019s embrace of the FP\u00d6 and the latter\u2019s repeated inclusion in national government helped make far-right policy positions mainstream, which in turn made the far right more acceptable to the general public \u2013 perhaps ultimately helping it win September\u2019s elections. Because if the mainstream already parrots the far right, then why not just vote for the \u201creal thing\u201d instead? People prefer the original over the copy, as the far-right French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen once said, and as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/apr/13/copying-far-right-doesnt-help-mainstream-parties\">research confirms</a>.</p> <p>The \u00d6VP will now probably become the junior party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/austria-election-talks-forming-government-far-right-freedom-party-win\">in a coalition</a> with a dominant FP\u00d6. As is the case following recent elections in several other European countries, such as Italy and the Netherlands, the far right is now the largest contingent in the rightwing block.

      "bodyText": "While Europe may be \u201csleepwalking into a far-right trap\u201d, Austria is consciously walking straight into it. After all, polls had predicted the most recent electoral success of the Austrian Freedom party (FP\u00d6) for almost two years. While the far-right party\u2019s leader, Herbert Kickl, heralded its victory as the beginning of \u201ca new era\u201d, it is better understood as a seemingly unavoidable progression. If anything, the country\u2019s recent election results confirmed a broader pattern of far-right normalisation in Europe in general and in Austria in particular. Although 29% was indeed its best result ever in a nationwide election, the FP\u00d6 has consistently achieved results in the double digits since 1990, has been included in the national government multiple times, and currently governs in several states with the conservative Austrian People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP). After the most recent state election in Vorarlberg, the \u00d6VP is about to form its fourth regional coalition with the FP\u00d6 there. As such, Austria is a perfect example of the dangerous shortsightedness of normalising far-right parties \u2013 a process led in the 21st century by, above all, conservative parties. It started as a way to strengthen its own power, but the \u00d6VP\u2019s embrace of the FP\u00d6 and the latter\u2019s repeated inclusion in national government helped make far-right policy positions mainstream, which in turn made the far right more acceptable to the general public \u2013 perhaps ultimately helping it win September\u2019s elections. Because if the mainstream already parrots the far right, then why not just vote for the \u201creal thing\u201d instead? People prefer the original over the copy, as the far-right French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen once said, and as research confirms. The \u00d6VP will now probably become the junior party in a coalition with a dominant FP\u00d6. As is the case following recent elections in several other European countries, such as Italy and the Netherlands, the far right is now the largest contingent in the rightwing block. Given that many conservative parties have by now worked alongside far-right parties at a national or local level, suddenly questioning their competence and abilities rings hollow and hypocritical, and not just to the far right. Unsurprisingly, the \u00d6VP\u2019s normalisation of the far right \u2013 linked to its own radicalisation on certain issues, such as Islam and immigration \u2013 has created expectations among its own voters. Today, a substantial share of \u00d6VP supporters consider the FP\u00d6 to be a better coalition partner than any mainstream party. In a recent poll from before the election, almost half (48%) of \u00d6VP voters said the party should govern with the \u201cKickl FP\u00d6\u201d, while just over a third (34%) of \u00d6VP voters preferred to govern with the \u201cBabler SP\u00d6\u201d, meaning the leader of the Social Democrats, Andreas Babler, and his party. Although the \u00d6VP was the only mainstream party that had not categorically ruled out governing with the FP\u00d6 before the election, it did declare its leader, Kickl, persona non grata. While the \u00d6VP leader, Karl Nehammer, still holds on to this odd separation \u2013 as though Kickl is somehow exceptional \u2013 he is already at odds with almost half of his voters. Moreover, Kickl was the minister for the interior in the previous \u00d6VP-FP\u00d6 government. Incidentally, during that government, cut short by the infamous Ibiza scandal, the \u00d6VP chose to ignore the FP\u00d6\u2019s behaviour: as interior minister, Kickl ordered a police raid of Austria\u2019s own domestic intelligence agency, a move was later declared illegal and disproportionate, as the underlying reasons for the search proved to be unfounded. Moreover, the \u00d6VP had also undermined itself in office, as the conviction of the former chancellor Sebastian Kurz for making false statements to a parliamentary inquiry into alleged corruption demonstrated. This suggests that close collaboration with the far right normalises not only its policy stances but also its behaviour. Given that the \u00d6VP did little to stop the FP\u00d6 when it was the senior party in the coalition, what can we expect of it as the junior partner? Importantly, Austria is not the only country in western Europe demonstrating this dangerous pattern of far-right normalisation. In both Italy and Sweden, for instance, a far-right party has become the most popular within the rightwing block.

It is identical in capability and hardware to the cheaper, smaller iPhone 16, which means it lacks the zoom camera, more advanced screen and other capabilities of the company\u2019s Pro iPhones.</p> <p>Though the 6.7in display is sizeable, it is no longer the biggest screen on an iPhone, as the 16 Pro Max has an even larger and better display, for which you pay a hefty premium. Instead, the Plus has tremendous battery life that should see general usage of up to three days between charges and outlast even the heaviest of use days.</p> <p>So the 16 Plus is for those that want a bigger but not the best screen or need really long battery life. The trade-off is that it is \u00a3100 more than the already great regular iPhone 16, it is difficult to use one-handed and is a bit of a bulky lump in your pocket.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> fast, good dual camera with macro mode, big screen, action button, camera control button, photographic styles, USB-C, very long battery life, long software support, Face ID.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> no telephoto camera, screen slower than competition and Pro iPhones, no always-on display mode, needs two hands to use most of the time.</p> </blockquote>  ",

If you don\u2019t like Apple\u2019s default look to photos you can get very creative with your own settings. The camera can also shoot spatial photos and videos for viewing on headsets such as the Vision Pro, and has the impressive audio mix feature for video from the 16 Pro. Overall, the 16 Plus has a good camera, but its lack of an extended zoom camera is disappointing, particularly at this size and price. Price The iPhone 16 Plus costs from \u00a3899 (\u20ac1,099/$899/A$1,599) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16 costs \u00a3799, iPhone 16 Pro costs \u00a3999, the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs \u00a31,199, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL costs \u00a31,099, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus costs \u00a3999 and the Fairphone 5 costs \u00a3499. Verdict The iPhone 16 Plus occupies an odd spot in Apple\u2019s 2024 smartphone lineup. It is identical in capability and hardware to the cheaper, smaller iPhone 16, which means it lacks the zoom camera, more advanced screen and other capabilities of the company\u2019s Pro iPhones. Though the 6.7in display is sizeable, it is no longer the biggest screen on an iPhone, as the 16 Pro Max has an even larger and better display, for which you pay a hefty premium. Instead, the Plus has tremendous battery life that should see general usage of up to three days between charges and outlast even the heaviest of use days. So the 16 Plus is for those that want a bigger but not the best screen or need really long battery life. The trade-off is that it is \u00a3100 more than the already great regular iPhone 16, it is difficult to use one-handed and is a bit of a bulky lump in your pocket. Pros: fast, good dual camera with macro mode, big screen, action button, camera control button, photographic styles, USB-C, very long battery life, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no telephoto camera, screen slower than competition and Pro iPhones, no always-on display mode, needs two hands to use most of the time.",

The premier said current contribution arrangements for developers were \u201ccomplex, inequitable and unfair\u201d and an \u201cadministrative nightmare\u201d that can slow down building homes. \u201cThere is something like 43 of the 79 local government councils across the state that collect these developer contributions,\u201d she told reporters on Tuesday at Wollert in Melbourne\u2019s outer north. \u201cBut they collect them in a whole range of different ways \u2026 they can be different from one block of land to the next.\u201d Allan said the lack of a uniform statewide approach meant that areas where more homes were being built did not get \u201cthe opportunity to share in this funding\u201d. She said the development industry recognised the infrastructure contribution landscape needed reform, with a working group to report to back to government by March 2025. The planning minister, Sonya Kilkenny, said the aim was to a create a regime to eventually be used statewide. \u201cWhat we want to see is a simplified system,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething that is going to be fit for purpose and that works for all communities and for all local government areas around the state.\u201d The opposition spokesperson for home ownership and housing affordability, Evan Mulholland, said the government\u2019s announcement was a \u201ctax on housing\u201d that would increase the cost of homes. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen examples of growth areas not getting the infrastructure they deserve because hundreds of millions of dollars have been held up in Treasury coffers on Spring Street instead of being delivered to communities before residents move in,\u201d he said. \u201cLabor have completely botched the delivery of new growth areas.

Hayward, chair of the independent social housing regulation review commissioned by the Victorian government, said there was little detail about the proposal as it would be finalised during a consultation process. He said it was concerning that the working group with the property industry was largely made up of \u201cpeople with a very vested interest in the outcome of the decision\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no balance in that working group,\u201d he said. Under the current system, developers make a one-off payment toward essential state infrastructure in most of Melbourne\u2019s greenfield suburbs under the Growth Areas Infrastructure Contribution. Other schemes are mainly used to fund local government infrastructure. It is estimated the Growth Areas Infrastructure Contribution pays for just 15% of the state infrastructure and services needed in growth areas. Infrastructure Victoria has long been calling for the state government to set up a consistent and efficient infrastructure contribution system. The opposition\u2019s spokesperson for planning, Liberal MP James Newbury \u2013 whose electorate of Brighton is affected by the state government\u2019s contentious move to seize planning control of some of Melbourne\u2019s most affluent suburbs \u2013 on Tuesday published what he claimed was a leaked outline of Labor\u2019s housing reform announcements that it plans to continue rolling out this week.

      "body": "<p>Good morning.</p> <p>In September 2023, Justin Trudeau stood up in parliament and made extraordinary allegations against the Indian government. The prime minister said Canadian authorities were investigating \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/18/credible-evidence-india-behind-killing-of-canadian-sikh-leader-says-trudeau\">credible allegations</a>\u201d about the potential involvement of Indian officials in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/advocate-separate-sikh-state-india-shot-dead-canada-hardeep-singh-nijjar-temple\">murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Canadian Sikh separatist activist in British Columbia.</p> <p>India issued a furious response, dismissing the allegations as absurd and vehemently denying any involvement. The fallout was swift: diplomats were expelled from both countries and India suspended visa services for Canadian citizens for a month.</p> <p>Now, the situation has further inflamed. Canadian police officials made even bigger accusations, accusing Indian diplomats and consular staff of participating in a criminal network run by a notorious Indian gangster. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/justin-trudeau-testimony-india\">In a public inquiry</a>, Trudeau said that Canada could not \u201caccept this fundamental violation of its sovereignty\u201d. And on Friday, Canada\u2019s foreign minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/canada-india-diplomats-warned-anti-sikh\">put India\u2019s remaining diplomats \u201con notice\u201d</a>, threatening expulsion if the country had indeed put Canadian lives at risk.</p> <p>To untangle this complicated story, I spoke with the Guardian\u2019s south Asia correspondent, Hannah Ellis-Petersen, about the many allegations levelled at India. That\u2019s right after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Middle East </strong></em>| Israel has accused Hezbollah of keeping hundreds of millions of dollars in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israel-claims-hezbollah-bunker-under-beirut-hospital-holds-millions-in-cash\">cash and gold in a bunker under a hospital in the southern suburbs of Beirut</a>, though it said it would not strike the complex. The Sahel hospital in Dahiyeh was evacuated shortly afterwards, and Fadi Alame, its director, told Reuters that the allegations were untrue.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Labour </strong></em>| A cross-party group of 30 MPs has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/22/cross-party-mps-urge-reeves-to-impose-2-tax-on-wealth-above-10m\">urged Rachel Reeves to impose a 2% tax on wealth above \u00a310m </a>on Britain\u2019s rich in next week\u2019s budget rather than announce spending cuts that would hit the most poor hardest.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Ukraine </strong></em>| Britain is to lend Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/22/uk-lend-ukraine-2bn-for-weapons-to-fight-russia\">an additional \u00a32.26bn and allow Kyiv to spend the money on weapons to fight off the Russian invasion</a> as part of a wider $50bn (\u00a338.5bn) loan programme expected to be confirmed by G7 members later this week.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Sudan </strong></em>| Refugees and aid agencies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/21/despair-chad-camps-refugees-flee-sudan\">have warned of deteriorating conditions in overcrowded camps in Chad</a>, as intensifying violence and a hunger crisis in Sudan drive huge numbers across the border. About 25,000 people \u2013 the vast majority women and children \u2013 crossed into eastern Chad in the first week of October. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/22/what-caused-the-civil-war-in-sudan-and-how-has-it-become-one-of-the-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crises\">Read an explainer</a>. </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>European Union</strong></em> | Moldovans have voted by a razor-thin majority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/moldova-vote-join-eu-razor-thin-majority\">in favour of joining the EU</a>, nearly final results showed on Monday after a pivotal referendum clouded by allegations of Russian interference. With 50.18% supporting EU membership, the decision was much closer than pre-referendum polls suggested. </p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018There is a sense in India they can get away with this\u2019</h2>    <p>Canada is not the only country scrutinising potential involvement of the Indian government in crimes against dissidents. Last year, US investigators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/29/india-assassination-attempt-american-citizen\">claimed that they foiled</a> an alleged assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist, arranged by Indian government officials. The US justice department <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/20/allegations-suggest-india-is-now-part-of-the-assassination-club\">named Vikash Yadav as the spy that orchestrated the plot</a>, while the US Drug Enforcement Administration accused Yadav of using \u201chis position of authority and access to confidential information to direct the attempted assassination of an outspoken critic of the Indian government here on US soil\u201d. And, earlier this year, a cross-party group of politicians in the UK <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-68148447\">requested an urgent meeting</a> with then-security minister Tom Tugendhat after reports that \u201cthreat to life warnings\u201d were being issued to British Sikhs.</p> <p>What the Sikh activists allegedly targeted by the Indian government have in common is that they are part of the Khalistan movement, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/27/canada-sikh-india-khalistan-hardeep-singh-nijjar\">separatist group</a> that seeks to create a homeland in the north-western state of Punjab, where most of India\u2019s Sikh population lives.</p> <p>The movement gained traction in the 1970s and 80s, but largely dissipated domestically in the following decades. It is still considered a security threat by the government though, which is fearful that online groups run by separatists in Canada will stir up a resurgence within the Punjab region.</p> <p>\u201cThe BJP believes that everyone should rally behind a uniform, singular nationalist identity of India so movements like the Khalistan movement have historically been seen as a huge threat to that nationalist project for the country,\u201d Hannah says.</p> <p>There are still pockets of support for the movement in the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada, which has the largest Sikh population outside India. Canada\u2019s refusal to extradite the most vocal activists to India has long been a source of tension between the two countries, but Trudeau\u2019s comments have now created a significant rupture in their diplomatic relationship. In the year since this row began, India has launched a vociferous campaign to paint Canada as a country that is harbouring terrorists and actors hostile to the Indian state.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Claims of a large Indian criminal network</strong></p> <p>Last week\u2019s press statement by Canadian police is a significant escalation in the severity of the allegations. Previously, Indian diplomats were persons of interest in the killing of Nijjar (three Indian nationals were arrested for the killing). Now, Canada is alleging that Indian officials had been involved in a larger criminal network \u2013 run by gang leader Lawrence Bishnoi \u2013 that systematically harasses and intimidates those considered to be associated with the Khalistani movement. \u201cThey accused them of surveillance, targeted attacks, and most particularly of targeted killings of Canadian Sikhs,\u201d Hannah says.</p> <p>Trudeau said he recently spoke to India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, in Singapore, during a meeting with senior intelligence and national security officials from both countries, where Canadian officials presented intelligence and evidence in support of their claims. Nonetheless, India dismissed the evidence as erroneous, continuing to accuse the Canadian government of pursuing the allegations to garner political support from the country\u2019s large Sikh community, and refusing to cooperate with what it views as a smear campaign.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Assassination allegations in the US</strong></p>    <p>Just a few months after the murder of Nijjar, the US said it had thwarted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/22/us-thwarts-plot-to-kill-sikh-separatist-and-issues-diplomatic-warning-to-india\">plot to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun</a>, an American and Canadian citizen and prominent Khalistani critic of Modi. Pannun was declared a terrorist by the Indian government in 2020 and is wanted in almost two dozen cases \u2013 he says all the charges against him are false.</p> <p>In June 2023, Nikhil Gupta, an Indian citizen, attempted to pay a hitman $100,000 in cash to assassinate Pannun \u2013 without realising that the supposed hitman was actually an undercover federal agent. Gupta was allegedly instructed by Yadav, the supposed Indian spy. The indictment naming Yadav, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/17/vikash-yadak-indian-spy-charged\">unsealed last week</a>, stated that Yadav was \u201cemployed by the government of India\u2019s cabinet secretariat, which is a part of the Indian prime minister\u2019s office\u201d. The FBI director, Christopher Wray, issued a statement making clear that \u201cthe FBI will not tolerate acts of violence or other efforts to retaliate against those residing in the US for exercising their constitutionally protected rights\u201d. India\u2019s government confirmed that Yadav was no longer an employee.</p> <p>The two cases are intricately linked because Gupta unwittingly told the undercover agent that Nijjar \u201cwas also a target\u201d and that there are \u201cso many targets\u201d. Six days after Gupta told the undercover agent that Nijjar was a target, Nijjar was shot outside a gurdwara (a Sikh place of worship) in British Columbia. Gupta then allegedly received a video clip from the Indian official that showed Nijjar\u2019s \u201cbloody body slumped in his vehicle\u201d.</p> <p>Despite India\u2019s complete refusal to cooperate with Canada, India is cooperating with the US. They have sent a team of investigators to look into the case and they have fired the state official that has been implicated in the crime, who they have said is a rogue agent.</p> <p>\u201cIndia is agreeing to comply with America in their investigation, while simultaneously completely denying any involvement in the Canadian one, even though they are so closely linked,\u201d which seems contradictory, Hannah says.</p> <p>These two cases, among other examples of surveillance and intimidation, are part of a wider pattern of \u201ctransnational repression,\u201d she adds and mark a radical shift, ushered in under Modi, in the way Indian intelligence treats its critics who live abroad.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The diplomatic fallout</strong></p> <p>India has been laying the groundwork for years to be considered a political and economic superpower. \u201cOther superpowers have behaved in this way in the past and have taken out those who they see as terrorists on foreign soil,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cAnd so there is, I think, this sense in India that, now that they have that type of strength behind them and they have much stronger relationships with these countries, they can also get away with this.\u201d</p> <p>But covert operations such as these are usually more sophisticated. If India is found guilty of organising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/22/us-thwarts-plot-to-kill-sikh-separatist-and-issues-diplomatic-warning-to-india\">Pannun</a>\u2019s assassination, it made some shockingly clumsy decisions and left behind quite a trail.</p> <p>Despite the allegations of extrajudicial violence on foreign soil, the US continues to insist that its relationship with India is not in jeopardy. The two countries are continuing to sign <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-us-cooperate-critical-battery-minerals-trade-minister-says-2024-10-03/\">mutually beneficial agreements and deals</a>. India understands that it occupies a uniquely powerful position: for the US, its growth and size offers a critical counterbalance to China.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. In September 2023, Justin Trudeau stood up in parliament and made extraordinary allegations against the Indian government. The prime minister said Canadian authorities were investigating \u201ccredible allegations\u201d about the potential involvement of Indian officials in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian Sikh separatist activist in British Columbia. India issued a furious response, dismissing the allegations as absurd and vehemently denying any involvement. The fallout was swift: diplomats were expelled from both countries and India suspended visa services for Canadian citizens for a month. Now, the situation has further inflamed. Canadian police officials made even bigger accusations, accusing Indian diplomats and consular staff of participating in a criminal network run by a notorious Indian gangster. In a public inquiry, Trudeau said that Canada could not \u201caccept this fundamental violation of its sovereignty\u201d. And on Friday, Canada\u2019s foreign minister put India\u2019s remaining diplomats \u201con notice\u201d, threatening expulsion if the country had indeed put Canadian lives at risk. To untangle this complicated story, I spoke with the Guardian\u2019s south Asia correspondent, Hannah Ellis-Petersen, about the many allegations levelled at India. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Middle East | Israel has accused Hezbollah of keeping hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold in a bunker under a hospital in the southern suburbs of Beirut, though it said it would not strike the complex. The Sahel hospital in Dahiyeh was evacuated shortly afterwards, and Fadi Alame, its director, told Reuters that the allegations were untrue. Labour | A cross-party group of 30 MPs has urged Rachel Reeves to impose a 2% tax on wealth above \u00a310m on Britain\u2019s rich in next week\u2019s budget rather than announce spending cuts that would hit the most poor hardest. Ukraine | Britain is to lend Ukraine an additional \u00a32.26bn and allow Kyiv to spend the money on weapons to fight off the Russian invasion as part of a wider $50bn (\u00a338.5bn) loan programme expected to be confirmed by G7 members later this week. Sudan | Refugees and aid agencies have warned of deteriorating conditions in overcrowded camps in Chad, as intensifying violence and a hunger crisis in Sudan drive huge numbers across the border. About 25,000 people \u2013 the vast majority women and children \u2013 crossed into eastern Chad in the first week of October. Read an explainer. European Union | Moldovans have voted by a razor-thin majority in favour of joining the EU, nearly final results showed on Monday after a pivotal referendum clouded by allegations of Russian interference. With 50.18% supporting EU membership, the decision was much closer than pre-referendum polls suggested. In depth: \u2018There is a sense in India they can get away with this\u2019 Canada is not the only country scrutinising potential involvement of the Indian government in crimes against dissidents. Last year, US investigators claimed that they foiled an alleged assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist, arranged by Indian government officials. The US justice department named Vikash Yadav as the spy that orchestrated the plot, while the US Drug Enforcement Administration accused Yadav of using \u201chis position of authority and access to confidential information to direct the attempted assassination of an outspoken critic of the Indian government here on US soil\u201d. And, earlier this year, a cross-party group of politicians in the UK requested an urgent meeting with then-security minister Tom Tugendhat after reports that \u201cthreat to life warnings\u201d were being issued to British Sikhs. What the Sikh activists allegedly targeted by the Indian government have in common is that they are part of the Khalistan movement, a separatist group that seeks to create a homeland in the north-western state of Punjab, where most of India\u2019s Sikh population lives. The movement gained traction in the 1970s and 80s, but largely dissipated domestically in the following decades. It is still considered a security threat by the government though, which is fearful that online groups run by separatists in Canada will stir up a resurgence within the Punjab region. \u201cThe BJP believes that everyone should rally behind a uniform, singular nationalist identity of India so movements like the Khalistan movement have historically been seen as a huge threat to that nationalist project for the country,\u201d Hannah says. There are still pockets of support for the movement in the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada, which has the largest Sikh population outside India. Canada\u2019s refusal to extradite the most vocal activists to India has long been a source of tension between the two countries, but Trudeau\u2019s comments have now created a significant rupture in their diplomatic relationship. In the year since this row began, India has launched a vociferous campaign to paint Canada as a country that is harbouring terrorists and actors hostile to the Indian state. *** Claims of a large Indian criminal network Last week\u2019s press statement by Canadian police is a significant escalation in the severity of the allegations. Previously, Indian diplomats were persons of interest in the killing of Nijjar (three Indian nationals were arrested for the killing). Now, Canada is alleging that Indian officials had been involved in a larger criminal network \u2013 run by gang leader Lawrence Bishnoi \u2013 that systematically harasses and intimidates those considered to be associated with the Khalistani movement. \u201cThey accused them of surveillance, targeted attacks, and most particularly of targeted killings of Canadian Sikhs,\u201d Hannah says. Trudeau said he recently spoke to India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, in Singapore, during a meeting with senior intelligence and national security officials from both countries, where Canadian officials presented intelligence and evidence in support of their claims. Nonetheless, India dismissed the evidence as erroneous, continuing to accuse the Canadian government of pursuing the allegations to garner political support from the country\u2019s large Sikh community, and refusing to cooperate with what it views as a smear campaign. *** Assassination allegations in the US Just a few months after the murder of Nijjar, the US said it had thwarted a plot to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American and Canadian citizen and prominent Khalistani critic of Modi. Pannun was declared a terrorist by the Indian government in 2020 and is wanted in almost two dozen cases \u2013 he says all the charges against him are false. In June 2023, Nikhil Gupta, an Indian citizen, attempted to pay a hitman $100,000 in cash to assassinate Pannun \u2013 without realising that the supposed hitman was actually an undercover federal agent. Gupta was allegedly instructed by Yadav, the supposed Indian spy. The indictment naming Yadav, which was unsealed last week, stated that Yadav was \u201cemployed by the government of India\u2019s cabinet secretariat, which is a part of the Indian prime minister\u2019s office\u201d. The FBI director, Christopher Wray, issued a statement making clear that \u201cthe FBI will not tolerate acts of violence or other efforts to retaliate against those residing in the US for exercising their constitutionally protected rights\u201d. India\u2019s government confirmed that Yadav was no longer an employee. The two cases are intricately linked because Gupta unwittingly told the undercover agent that Nijjar \u201cwas also a target\u201d and that there are \u201cso many targets\u201d. Six days after Gupta told the undercover agent that Nijjar was a target, Nijjar was shot outside a gurdwara (a Sikh place of worship) in British Columbia. Gupta then allegedly received a video clip from the Indian official that showed Nijjar\u2019s \u201cbloody body slumped in his vehicle\u201d. Despite India\u2019s complete refusal to cooperate with Canada, India is cooperating with the US. They have sent a team of investigators to look into the case and they have fired the state official that has been implicated in the crime, who they have said is a rogue agent. \u201cIndia is agreeing to comply with America in their investigation, while simultaneously completely denying any involvement in the Canadian one, even though they are so closely linked,\u201d which seems contradictory, Hannah says. These two cases, among other examples of surveillance and intimidation, are part of a wider pattern of \u201ctransnational repression,\u201d she adds and mark a radical shift, ushered in under Modi, in the way Indian intelligence treats its critics who live abroad. *** The diplomatic fallout India has been laying the groundwork for years to be considered a political and economic superpower. \u201cOther superpowers have behaved in this way in the past and have taken out those who they see as terrorists on foreign soil,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cAnd so there is, I think, this sense in India that, now that they have that type of strength behind them and they have much stronger relationships with these countries, they can also get away with this.\u201d But covert operations such as these are usually more sophisticated. If India is found guilty of organising Pannun\u2019s assassination, it made some shockingly clumsy decisions and left behind quite a trail. Despite the allegations of extrajudicial violence on foreign soil, the US continues to insist that its relationship with India is not in jeopardy. The two countries are continuing to sign mutually beneficial agreements and deals. India understands that it occupies a uniquely powerful position: for the US, its growth and size offers a critical counterbalance to China. The indictment of Yadav signals, though, that the US is not willing to give India carte blanche. And, crucially, India will struggle to alienate Canada indefinitely because of Canada\u2019s strong and historic ties with the US and the UK. Both countries are pressuring India to cooperate with Canada\u2019s investigations. Even in the case of criminal prosecution, any material repercussions are likely to be limited \u2013 the government will simply distance itself from the individuals who are implicated and claim that they were lone actors. At worst, India might be viewed as more of a rogue nation than before. Hannah says: \u201cUltimately, you just have to look elsewhere to see what the precedent is for these kinds of crimes.\u201d She adds that while the US found Saudi Arabia to be responsible for the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, it was \u201cquite happy to resume that relationship and seemingly turn a blind eye to what is essentially an extrajudicial killing,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cIndia knows this.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Zoe Williams has written a supremely enjoyable primer on Rivals, the new Disney adaptation of the Jilly Cooper classic, and how it somehow engenders nostalgia for the 80s: \u201cCan you imagine anyone in a Jilly Cooper novel who had to get up early?

Pjotr Sauer reports Cartoon of the day | Rebecca Hendin The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad Even the most fastidious horticulturalist probably welcomes the sight of a dog or two running around in their garden \u2013 but at the Chelsea flower show, they have never been welcome. From next year, though, that will change in at least one garden: the one designed by the Gardeners\u2019 World presenter and noted golden retriever enthusiast Monty Don. In an exhibit designed to make all gardeners feel more welcome to Chelsea, Don\u2019s first ever Chelsea garden will centre on a manicured lawn, which he believes to be essential for canine sprawling, sleeping, rolling, flopping, itching and chasing balls. He will also be including a large tree for shade, and bringing inspiration from his own garden in Herefordshire, including brick paths, a summerhouse and a meadow planted with ornamental bulbs. Radio 2\u2019s Jo Whiley will also be curating a dog-themed playlist for the garden, which will be playing throughout the show from the summerhouse. Don has said that he likes dogs so much because they are \u201cnot humans\u201d; viewers of Gardeners\u2019 World will know his late golden retrievers, Nigel and Nell (pictured with Don in a slightly more dramatic setting in 2016) and more recent arrivals: Yorkshire terrier Patti and a new golden retriever puppy, Ned. Above all, he said, the garden will be \u201ca celebration of the way that so many of us share our gardens with our canine companions\u201d.

      "body": "<p>British regulators have been urged by MPs to examine the relationship between London estate agents, lawyers and lenders and a former Bangladeshi government minister under investigation for alleged corruption.</p> <p>Saifuzzaman Chowdhury was the land minister in Bangladesh until earlier this year, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/05/why-bangladesh-prime-minister-sheikh-hasina-resigned\">government of Sheikh Hasina was spectacularly toppled</a>, after her regime\u2019s violent suppression of student protests.</p> <p>Chowdhury has since had his bank accounts frozen and is being investigated by<strong> </strong>Dhaka authorities, amid allegations of corruption against multiple members of the deposed government.</p> <p>A lawyer, who no longer acts for Chowdhury, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26fa8c8c-c9b5-4803-89d8-107e5c88738a\">previously said that his client has \u201cnothing to hide\u201d</a> and had acquired his wealth before entering politics. Chowdhury\u2019s UK real estate portfolio includes more than 250 properties worth an estimated \u00a3200m.</p> <p>Now an MP on the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on anti-corruption has asked HM Revenue and Customs, the Financial Conduct Authority (FDCA) and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to investigate whether UK companies followed anti-money laundering rules when helping Chowdhury with property deals.</p> <p>In letters seen by the Guardian, Labour MP Phil Brickell called on the three regulators to ensure that companies involved in the transactions \u201cundertook adequate checks on the source of Mr Chowdhury\u2019s wealth and funds\u201d.</p> <p>He urged HMRC, the FCA and the SRA to ensure that British estate agents, law firms and lenders had abided by their regulatory obligations.</p> <p>\u201cShowing that the UK is serious about making London the anti-corruption capital of the world requires proactive, swift and robust investigation where allegations of these kinds emerge,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Members of the parliamentary APPG on anti-corruption and responsible tax met last week to discuss how to assist Bangladesh in tracking UK assets linked to people under investigation by Dhaka authorities.

      "bodyText": "British regulators have been urged by MPs to examine the relationship between London estate agents, lawyers and lenders and a former Bangladeshi government minister under investigation for alleged corruption. Saifuzzaman Chowdhury was the land minister in Bangladesh until earlier this year, when the government of Sheikh Hasina was spectacularly toppled, after her regime\u2019s violent suppression of student protests. Chowdhury has since had his bank accounts frozen and is being investigated by Dhaka authorities, amid allegations of corruption against multiple members of the deposed government. A lawyer, who no longer acts for Chowdhury, previously said that his client has \u201cnothing to hide\u201d and had acquired his wealth before entering politics. Chowdhury\u2019s UK real estate portfolio includes more than 250 properties worth an estimated \u00a3200m. Now an MP on the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on anti-corruption has asked HM Revenue and Customs, the Financial Conduct Authority (FDCA) and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to investigate whether UK companies followed anti-money laundering rules when helping Chowdhury with property deals. In letters seen by the Guardian, Labour MP Phil Brickell called on the three regulators to ensure that companies involved in the transactions \u201cundertook adequate checks on the source of Mr Chowdhury\u2019s wealth and funds\u201d. He urged HMRC, the FCA and the SRA to ensure that British estate agents, law firms and lenders had abided by their regulatory obligations. \u201cShowing that the UK is serious about making London the anti-corruption capital of the world requires proactive, swift and robust investigation where allegations of these kinds emerge,\u201d he said. Members of the parliamentary APPG on anti-corruption and responsible tax met last week to discuss how to assist Bangladesh in tracking UK assets linked to people under investigation by Dhaka authorities. The chair of the group, Joe Powell MP, has written to the National Crime Agency urging it to investigate assets in the UK linked to members of the former Bangladeshi regime, including Chowdhury. The role of western companies that work with politically connected overseas business figures has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, particularly after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Brickell wants regulators to check whether UK firms filed \u201csuspicious activity reports\u201d, which they must submit to law enforcement if they are concerned about potential money laundering, and whether they may have committed a criminal offence if they failed to do so. The central bank of Bangladesh has frozen bank accounts belonging to Chowdhury and family members, while the country\u2019s Anti-Corruption Commission is investigating allegations that he illegally acquired hundreds of millions of dollars and laundered it in the UK. According to reports in Dhaka, British government officials have pledged to assist Bangladesh in locating any UK assets held by those under investigation. The governor of Bangladesh\u2019s central bank told the Financial Times last month that he had sought the UK\u2019s help is investigating whether members of Hasina\u2019s regime diverted \u00a313bn of assets overseas. He said he had asked the UK to identify the source of funds for \u00a3150m of Chowdhury\u2019s property purchases, which include several luxury London mansions. A lawyer for Chowdhury previously said his client was being subjected to a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d instigated by the new Bangladeshi regime and that there was a risk he could be the subject of a miscarriage of justice. Chowdhury had said that his overseas assets had been funded by legitimate international business interests. Bangladeshi citizens are subject to a strict limit of $12,000 (\u00a39,176) on assets that can be transferred out of the country. The lawyer said he was no longer instructed by Chowdhury and Chowdhury did not return requests for comment sent to his personal email addresses. A spokesperson for the SRA said: \u201cWe take the issue of potential breaches of money-laundering regulations very seriously and will take action if we find firms are not meeting these obligations.\u201d The FCA and HMRC declined to comment.",

The indie beer campaign includes a mark that will be used on beer pump clips, cans and bottle labels, as well as a website, indiebeer.uk, where consumers can check the credentials of their pint. The move also has backing from the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), whose members have traditionally seen cask ale as something separate from \u201ccraft beer\u201d, which has typically been applied to keg-dispensed beer. Heineken, AB InBev and Asahi have been approached for comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 October 2024. The website where consumers can check whether a brewery is independent is indiebeer.uk, not indiebeer.co.uk as an earlier version said.",

Research conducted by myself and my colleague Diana Bossio in 2023 also concluded that it had benefited the media industry financially \u2013 but that it cannot and should not operate in isolation from other supports for public interest journalism and that it has significant limitations at present. One of the limitations is that the code is operating as a threat rather than enforceable policy due to the absence of designation, which means it might lose efficacy over time if not revisited. There are also problems with the existing registration criteria for news outlets eligible to enter negotiation. More measures are needed, using different areas of law, to support our media ecosystem and democracy. The code used competition law to achieve one primary goal: it addressed a market imbalance between the social media platforms and news organisations. A digital services levy could use the existing tax system to redistribute revenue from big tech to public interest journalism, which would supplement the work of the code. These two measures can and should be used in tandem and should not be seen as opposing forces. Meta has made it very clear to Australians that they do not value Australian journalism, news and public interest media \u2013 nor do they value our ability to counter the mis- and disinformation that now flourishes on social media. It is up to us to build and maintain a healthy regulatory framework that supports public interest journalism and to revisit it when it needs to be updated or rebuilt. Instituting a digital services levy would be a useful addition to the arsenal. \u2022 Belinda Barnet is senior lecturer in media and communications at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne",

      "body": "<p>Nick Ephgrave has the air of a copper under siege. A former Metropolitan police officer who once pounded the pavements of Brixton in south London, the ninth director of the Serious Fraud Office can be forgiven for feeling claustrophobic in his office overlooking Trafalgar Square.</p> <p>The SFO\u2019s offices in Cockspur Street, near the tourist-thronged square and its barrage of buskers, are a far cry from the glass and steel headquarters of the companies it takes on.</p> <p>Even to enter Ephgrave\u2019s attic room \u2013 a small, corner office looking down on the gun-metal lions beneath Nelson\u2019s Column \u2013 he must first go through the security of the Canadian High Commission. Shabby carpet, struggling house plants and chipped mugs give an impression that is more Slough House, in the TV drama Slow Horses, than the UK\u2019s premier anti-fraud squad.</p> <p>At least he has a view; some of its staff work in its basements, taking vitamin D tablets to compensate for the lack of natural light. There, the majority of the SFO\u2019s historical case files are stored in a former swimming pool.</p> <p>Its dilapidated offices and soundtrack are distractions he could do without. Running the SFO is one of the highest-pressure jobs in law enforcement. His predecessors have faced heavy criticism, so much so that the body was nicknamed \u201cThe Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d, referring to a series of failures when it occupied its former offices. Being forced to set aside \u00a3250m for potential damages has earned it a new nickname among some senior Treasury officials: \u201cThe Cockups on Cockspur\u201d.</p> <p>In his most candid interview yet, Ephgrave goes further than any of his predecessors, admitting that the SFO has granted immunity from prosecution to an individual who helped it to snare white-collar criminals.</p> <p>While he says the organisation welcomed him, Ephgrave also has to bat away preconceived notions of who ought to be running the SFO, given that the role is often done by someone with a legal background.</p> <p>\u201cClearly, I\u2019m not a lawyer,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the things I think I bring, which I think my predecessors maybe hadn\u2019t, was experience of progressing investigations in all sorts of different ways. Introducing new tactics, new methodologies.\u201d</p> <p>Ephgrave says he faced resistance, a sense of: \u201c\u2018Who is this fella that\u2019s come in from policing into this rather specialist world?\u2019\u201d People were worried that this lack of legal experience might affect the \u201cquality of decision-making\u201d, he adds. \u201cGetting over that hump was a bit of a challenge, initially.\u201d</p> <p>Ephgrave may face more such challenges in the future, given his surprising admission that the SFO has granted complete immunity from prosecution to an individual, after their assistance in apprehending other offenders.</p> <p>He divulges the fact while outlining his plans to speed up the SFO\u2019s notoriously slow handling of cases, via what his US counterparts colloquially call \u201cflipping\u201d individuals, so that offenders assist the state \u2013 often described as turning king\u2019s evidence, in the UK system. This means, as Ephgrave explains it, using covert means to gather evidence on someone and then offering them a lesser charge or even immunity from prosecution in return for their assistance gathering evidence that can help secure other convictions.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, if you look at the legislation, I can actually, as director, in really extreme cases, authorise immunity from prosecution. Now, of course, that would be a very, very significant step to take and it\u2019s hard to imagine how that would work,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Asked if it has even been used before, he adds: \u201cI believe it has, once. You might need to factcheck me on that but I think it\u2019s been used once by the SFO. So I can do that, but rarely, rarely, rarely do we ever do it.\u201d</p> <p>It is a startling admission. The SFO has previously rejected freedom of information requests on whether it has granted immunity related to some specific time periods, saying that to do so would undermine its operations.</p> <p>People familiar with operations at the SFO confirmed that this power has been exercised.</p> <p>A former director of the SFO said they are \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d that Ephgrave confirmed, this and that in doing so he has \u201cset an entirely new and unhelpful precedent which is irresponsible at best\u201d. They said: \u201cIt should always be neither confirm nor deny.\u201d </p>    <p>Then there is its budget, a source of constant tension. As a rare prosecuting authority, the SFO takes on some of the world\u2019s best-resourced companies and individuals, who hire armies of lawyers to fend off the fraud-busters. Some of its recent high-profile cases include a corruption and bribery case involving Rolls-Royce that resulted in an almost \u00a3500m deferred prosecution agreement.

      "bodyText": "Nick Ephgrave has the air of a copper under siege. A former Metropolitan police officer who once pounded the pavements of Brixton in south London, the ninth director of the Serious Fraud Office can be forgiven for feeling claustrophobic in his office overlooking Trafalgar Square. The SFO\u2019s offices in Cockspur Street, near the tourist-thronged square and its barrage of buskers, are a far cry from the glass and steel headquarters of the companies it takes on. Even to enter Ephgrave\u2019s attic room \u2013 a small, corner office looking down on the gun-metal lions beneath Nelson\u2019s Column \u2013 he must first go through the security of the Canadian High Commission. Shabby carpet, struggling house plants and chipped mugs give an impression that is more Slough House, in the TV drama Slow Horses, than the UK\u2019s premier anti-fraud squad. At least he has a view; some of its staff work in its basements, taking vitamin D tablets to compensate for the lack of natural light. There, the majority of the SFO\u2019s historical case files are stored in a former swimming pool. Its dilapidated offices and soundtrack are distractions he could do without. Running the SFO is one of the highest-pressure jobs in law enforcement. His predecessors have faced heavy criticism, so much so that the body was nicknamed \u201cThe Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d, referring to a series of failures when it occupied its former offices. Being forced to set aside \u00a3250m for potential damages has earned it a new nickname among some senior Treasury officials: \u201cThe Cockups on Cockspur\u201d. In his most candid interview yet, Ephgrave goes further than any of his predecessors, admitting that the SFO has granted immunity from prosecution to an individual who helped it to snare white-collar criminals. While he says the organisation welcomed him, Ephgrave also has to bat away preconceived notions of who ought to be running the SFO, given that the role is often done by someone with a legal background. \u201cClearly, I\u2019m not a lawyer,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the things I think I bring, which I think my predecessors maybe hadn\u2019t, was experience of progressing investigations in all sorts of different ways. Introducing new tactics, new methodologies.\u201d Ephgrave says he faced resistance, a sense of: \u201c\u2018Who is this fella that\u2019s come in from policing into this rather specialist world?\u2019\u201d People were worried that this lack of legal experience might affect the \u201cquality of decision-making\u201d, he adds. \u201cGetting over that hump was a bit of a challenge, initially.\u201d Ephgrave may face more such challenges in the future, given his surprising admission that the SFO has granted complete immunity from prosecution to an individual, after their assistance in apprehending other offenders. He divulges the fact while outlining his plans to speed up the SFO\u2019s notoriously slow handling of cases, via what his US counterparts colloquially call \u201cflipping\u201d individuals, so that offenders assist the state \u2013 often described as turning king\u2019s evidence, in the UK system. This means, as Ephgrave explains it, using covert means to gather evidence on someone and then offering them a lesser charge or even immunity from prosecution in return for their assistance gathering evidence that can help secure other convictions. \u201cI mean, if you look at the legislation, I can actually, as director, in really extreme cases, authorise immunity from prosecution. Now, of course, that would be a very, very significant step to take and it\u2019s hard to imagine how that would work,\u201d he says. Asked if it has even been used before, he adds: \u201cI believe it has, once. You might need to factcheck me on that but I think it\u2019s been used once by the SFO. So I can do that, but rarely, rarely, rarely do we ever do it.\u201d It is a startling admission. The SFO has previously rejected freedom of information requests on whether it has granted immunity related to some specific time periods, saying that to do so would undermine its operations. People familiar with operations at the SFO confirmed that this power has been exercised. A former director of the SFO said they are \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d that Ephgrave confirmed, this and that in doing so he has \u201cset an entirely new and unhelpful precedent which is irresponsible at best\u201d. They said: \u201cIt should always be neither confirm nor deny.\u201d Then there is its budget, a source of constant tension. As a rare prosecuting authority, the SFO takes on some of the world\u2019s best-resourced companies and individuals, who hire armies of lawyers to fend off the fraud-busters. Some of its recent high-profile cases include a corruption and bribery case involving Rolls-Royce that resulted in an almost \u00a3500m deferred prosecution agreement. Its investigation into the activities of the steel and trading magnate Sanjeev Gupta is in its fourth year. The SFO\u2019s annual running cost of \u00a395m is dwarfed by the money that flows through the UK and its financial capital. It is minuscule compared with just one slice of the City\u2019s industry, for example: \u00a34.2tn of assets are under management by its financial professionals for overseas clients. Its annual budget is formed from a complex mixture of fixed funding and bids for so-called blockbuster funding for individual cases that exceed 5% of its annual budget. But it has also been known for some own goals, making it harder to win greater resources. It is going cap in hand in the spending review after already upsetting the Treasury: it was forced to set aside \u00a3250m for potential damages as the cost of cleaning up a failed investigation of the mining company ENRC, according to its parliamentary budget submissions. Ephgrave suggests that he is confident about future funding for the SFO. A move from applying for extra funds towards upfront money is a new \u201cexciting possibility that now presents itself in this current spending review period\u201d, he says. \u201cThat is an arrangement [blockbuster funding] that has been in place for some time. And it works. I mean, it provided us with quite a significant amount of money every year on the average to fund those big cases. So it wasn\u2019t broken,\u201d Ephgrave says. But that uncertain income makes it hard to recruit permanent staff. \u201cSo one of the things that\u2019s changed in this spending review is that a certain chunk of the money that we would normally expect to get through blockbuster case applications has actually been provided upfront. So that provides us with a degree of certainty on funding, which allows us then to make some bolder decisions around permanent recruitment, because we\u2019ve always had to have the ability to flex.\u201d This is far from a done deal, however, sources familiar with the financial negotiations and broader examination of the regulation and law enforcement of the City said. Ephgrave is also trying to improve incentives for individuals who help the SFO. He wants to be able to pay whistleblowers, adopting a US-style approach whereby informants can receive 10-30% of the money the government manages to win back from a case. If they provide \u201csmoking gun\u201d-type evidence, the SFO director wants to have powers to do likewise, and believes that it will speed up investigations and improve the quality of evidence. The SFO has faced a string of big failures in some of its prominent cases. One of its current prosecutions, which could pose an existential threat if unsuccessful, is against individuals linked to the mining company Glencore. \u201cThe team that worked here worked extremely hard to put together the evidence that\u2019s allowed us to go ahead and now charge six senior characters that were in that organisation at the time.

      "body": "<p>There is no watching Rivals, the Disney+ adaptation of the Jilly Cooper classic, and pretending the 80s weren\u2019t like that. The poisonous, unabashed homophobia of Tory politics; the hushed-up rapes, the sexual exploitation, the abuse of power, the objectification. Not to mention the inequality, the snobbery, the vulgar excess, the truly nauseating deference to aristocracy \u2013 a craven surrender to their innate superiority \u2013 and the racism and misogynoir. There is a highly plausible depiction of just how hard a black woman had to fight to exist and to be seen, even by the characters who are meant to be right-on. There is no denying any of it. So why does this high-camp, warts-and-all frolic through the 80s make me feel so nostalgic? Is it just because I had forgotten how much <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/19/oh-god-i-envied-his-voice-andrew-ridgeley-on-ego-angst-and-loving-george-michael\">I liked Wham!</a>?</p> <p>No, it is not just the Wham!. It\u2019s not even just for the bam, thank you ma\u2019am, but let\u2019s start there.</p> <h2>The bonkbuster: its history, tenets and internal logic</h2> <p>Lolz, not really. It would be my greatest delight to trace the arc of Cooper\u2019s approach to sex, from the incredibly horny but socially constrained heroines of her earliest novels (1977\u2019s Octavia, 1978\u2019s Imogen) through to Rivals (1988) \u2013 the middle and probably the pearl of the Rutshire Chronicles \u2013 and beyond, but we don\u2019t have time.</p> <p>To summarise: the characters love shagging. Not just the men. There are predatory, exploitative, deceitful shaggers, male and female, and there are lusty, carefree shaggers overflowing with life force, same proviso, and the sexual morality is very simple: if both people are really into it, this is the best thing that ever happened; deal with the fallout later. The worldview is reflexively consensual, because it centres pleasure and sometimes (but not always) love.</p> <p>Cooper doesn\u2019t call herself a feminist, which has led some people to conclude that sex positivity is the opposite of feminism. She has also made a few inconsistent remarks about the #MeToo movement (briefly, that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/jilly-cooper-author-men-diminished-metoo-feminism-a8753946.html\">it diminished men</a>, but also that it was good for women, sharing <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/jilly-cooper-rape-author-tackle-b2535766.html\">her own #MeToo story</a>), which has led some to conclude that she and, by extension, her oeuvre (and even era) didn\u2019t criticise predatory or exploitative behaviour enough.</p>    <p>But the 80s saw a lot of hot contest around sex, in which feminists weren\u2019t operating in a bell jar, separate from the rest of society; rather, we were having the same conversation as everyone else, just more articulately. There was an anti-pornography movement and a sex-positive one \u2013 and they fought, <em>a lot</em>, along the same lines as in the debates of the 60s and 70s: were women the victims of men\u2019s sexual aggression or the agents of their own sexual destiny?</p> <p>The anti-pornography position was set out in 1980, when the National Organization for Women described the \u201cbig four\u201d exploitations \u2013 pederasty, pornography, sadomasochism and public sex. That rhetorical manoeuvre, rolling kink and pornography in with the obvious injustice of paedophilia, then randomly sprinkling public sex on top, is a classic bad-faith argument.</p> <p>Sex-positive feminism sometimes found itself boxed into a corner, but it never just rolled over. It would continue to insist that sex was great, even pending a consensus (that never arrived) on pornography. And it saw no contradiction in castigating sexual violence and celebrating sex, because there isn\u2019t one. While this may, of course, be a coincidence, the numbers show that <a href=\"https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/are-we-really-having-less-sex\">everyone got laid a lot more in the 80s</a>.</p> <h2>Drinking in the mornings, smoking in the bath: debauchery and self-actualisation</h2> <p>Whether you always have a fat cigar on the go (David Tennant as Lord Baddingham) or a fag dangling from your mouth so naturally that you have probably forgotten it\u2019s there (Aidan Turner and Danny Dyer\u2019s characters); whether you are smoking in a plane (Annabel Scholey), on a train (Katherine Parkinson) or in an automobile (everyone), if anyone could make smoking look cool, it\u2019s these people. But the data is in, children. I\u2019m not going to make the case that the 80s were great because we could smoke without realising it was bad for you.</p>    <p>Nor could I stand up in court and argue the difference between a heavy drinker and an alcoholic, which Rivals takes as 101, the very nursery slopes of booze taxonomy. Knowing what we know now about the ills of alcohol, these levels of consumption seem untenable. A stiff drink after a difficult meeting; a raid on a rival\u2019s whisky stash, just to make a point; a half bottle of whisky upon receipt of bad news; a bottle of fizz instead of tea, to welcome a neighbour; a liquid lunch that leaves you staggering. In the land of Rivals, this is all natural, zesty, human appetite, a Jungian libido of which only a prig or a cynic would disapprove. </p> <p>Run the numbers on how many units that is, laugh if you like, but admit it: this world \u2013 where no one goes to the gym, except one character made of evil; where no one plays tennis except naked; where no one, but no one, is getting up at 5am to start their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/20/welcome-to-the-winter-arc-the-very-worst-season-in-the-self-improvement-calendar\">winter arc</a>; where wellness is not a thing; and where self-discipline is not even a refuge of the boring, but simply never mentioned \u2013 was great.</p> <p>At least, it was great on a nostalgic fantasy level. This was a world in which the individual didn\u2019t have all, or indeed any, of the answers. Allied to that, it was a world in which people hung out, went to parties, stayed late. Can you imagine anyone in a Cooper novel who had to get up early? They would be a laughing stock. Even Nafessa Williams as Cameron Cook, who introduces a US work ethic to the lolling Cotswold gentleman-amateurs \u2013 when she says she has to work, she means with a hangover, around brunch time, after scrambled eggs.</p> <h2>From low-carb diets to stone-washed denim: was the fat-shaming for real?</h2> <p>If you saw a wife in a modern drama, however satirical, who wouldn\u2019t allow her husband a potato, or a husband whose lip curled in disgust at the sight of his own (not even fat!) wife in underwear, you would say: this isn\u2019t a relationship; this is more like a jailer-inmate scenario. Interspousal snack-policing in Rivals is so intense that it drives two characters into one another\u2019s arms in \u2013 no spoilers, I promise \u2013 the most exquisite love story of the book.</p>    <p>The 80s were different: there was no compunction about ridiculing fatness, no taboo around valorising thinness. \u201cMoments on the lips, for ever on the hips\u201d, \u201cyou can never be too rich or too thin\u201d \u2013 people had these supposed aphorisms as fridge magnets. Worse was women\u2019s magazines advising readers to stick a picture of yourself, fat, on your fridge door to discourage \u2026 eating?</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t work, by the way. My friend\u2019s mum used to cook with tape over her mouth. Another friend\u2019s mum used to douse the bin with washing-up liquid, in case she \u201caccidentally\u201d picked out leftovers and ate them. While Rosemary Conley was devising her hip-and-thigh diet, Callan Pinckney was inventing Callanetics, which opened, in 1984, with a photo of where your legs should meet if you were thin enough (ankles, mid-calf, knees, mid-thigh and nowhere else).

Fashion in the 80s was one long mixed message, from the Amish-adjacent modesty of a Laura Ashley dress to the the boob tube, but it didn\u2019t have \u201clooking thin\u201d as its first precept.

This makes no sense: Thatcherite economics had cast millions into poverty and unemployment, the public realm was degraded by privatisation and underinvestment, the nuclear threat was immense and pervasive. It is unbelievable how many pop songs, dramas, <em>children\u2019s books</em>,<em> </em>in the 80s were explicitly about the nuclear holocaust. It was a neurotic life and I remember it viscerally. Even though, in retrospect, it was less threatening than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/21/humanity-earth-natural-limits-biodiversity-warning-cop16-conference-scientists-academics\">the climate crisis</a> \u2013 being just men pushing buttons, rather than whole systems failures decades in the making \u2013 it didn\u2019t feel at the time like anything less than ultimate jeopardy.</p> <p>Yet the optimism persisted; the hedonism persisted. We have been at the brink of disaster before, without anything like our present state of collective despair \u2013 so what the hell has happened? Have the amassed forces of capital poisoned the information well with hopelessness? Was it always the young who brought the optimism to the party \u2013 and a mistake, therefore, not to invite them?

      "bodyText": "There is no watching Rivals, the Disney+ adaptation of the Jilly Cooper classic, and pretending the 80s weren\u2019t like that. The poisonous, unabashed homophobia of Tory politics; the hushed-up rapes, the sexual exploitation, the abuse of power, the objectification. Not to mention the inequality, the snobbery, the vulgar excess, the truly nauseating deference to aristocracy \u2013 a craven surrender to their innate superiority \u2013 and the racism and misogynoir. There is a highly plausible depiction of just how hard a black woman had to fight to exist and to be seen, even by the characters who are meant to be right-on. There is no denying any of it. So why does this high-camp, warts-and-all frolic through the 80s make me feel so nostalgic? Is it just because I had forgotten how much I liked Wham!? No, it is not just the Wham!. It\u2019s not even just for the bam, thank you ma\u2019am, but let\u2019s start there. The bonkbuster: its history, tenets and internal logic Lolz, not really. It would be my greatest delight to trace the arc of Cooper\u2019s approach to sex, from the incredibly horny but socially constrained heroines of her earliest novels (1977\u2019s Octavia, 1978\u2019s Imogen) through to Rivals (1988) \u2013 the middle and probably the pearl of the Rutshire Chronicles \u2013 and beyond, but we don\u2019t have time. To summarise: the characters love shagging. Not just the men. There are predatory, exploitative, deceitful shaggers, male and female, and there are lusty, carefree shaggers overflowing with life force, same proviso, and the sexual morality is very simple: if both people are really into it, this is the best thing that ever happened; deal with the fallout later. The worldview is reflexively consensual, because it centres pleasure and sometimes (but not always) love. Cooper doesn\u2019t call herself a feminist, which has led some people to conclude that sex positivity is the opposite of feminism. She has also made a few inconsistent remarks about the #MeToo movement (briefly, that it diminished men, but also that it was good for women, sharing her own #MeToo story), which has led some to conclude that she and, by extension, her oeuvre (and even era) didn\u2019t criticise predatory or exploitative behaviour enough. But the 80s saw a lot of hot contest around sex, in which feminists weren\u2019t operating in a bell jar, separate from the rest of society; rather, we were having the same conversation as everyone else, just more articulately. There was an anti-pornography movement and a sex-positive one \u2013 and they fought, a lot, along the same lines as in the debates of the 60s and 70s: were women the victims of men\u2019s sexual aggression or the agents of their own sexual destiny? The anti-pornography position was set out in 1980, when the National Organization for Women described the \u201cbig four\u201d exploitations \u2013 pederasty, pornography, sadomasochism and public sex. That rhetorical manoeuvre, rolling kink and pornography in with the obvious injustice of paedophilia, then randomly sprinkling public sex on top, is a classic bad-faith argument. Sex-positive feminism sometimes found itself boxed into a corner, but it never just rolled over. It would continue to insist that sex was great, even pending a consensus (that never arrived) on pornography. And it saw no contradiction in castigating sexual violence and celebrating sex, because there isn\u2019t one. While this may, of course, be a coincidence, the numbers show that everyone got laid a lot more in the 80s. Drinking in the mornings, smoking in the bath: debauchery and self-actualisation Whether you always have a fat cigar on the go (David Tennant as Lord Baddingham) or a fag dangling from your mouth so naturally that you have probably forgotten it\u2019s there (Aidan Turner and Danny Dyer\u2019s characters); whether you are smoking in a plane (Annabel Scholey), on a train (Katherine Parkinson) or in an automobile (everyone), if anyone could make smoking look cool, it\u2019s these people. But the data is in, children. I\u2019m not going to make the case that the 80s were great because we could smoke without realising it was bad for you. Nor could I stand up in court and argue the difference between a heavy drinker and an alcoholic, which Rivals takes as 101, the very nursery slopes of booze taxonomy. Knowing what we know now about the ills of alcohol, these levels of consumption seem untenable. A stiff drink after a difficult meeting; a raid on a rival\u2019s whisky stash, just to make a point; a half bottle of whisky upon receipt of bad news; a bottle of fizz instead of tea, to welcome a neighbour; a liquid lunch that leaves you staggering. In the land of Rivals, this is all natural, zesty, human appetite, a Jungian libido of which only a prig or a cynic would disapprove. Run the numbers on how many units that is, laugh if you like, but admit it: this world \u2013 where no one goes to the gym, except one character made of evil; where no one plays tennis except naked; where no one, but no one, is getting up at 5am to start their winter arc; where wellness is not a thing; and where self-discipline is not even a refuge of the boring, but simply never mentioned \u2013 was great. At least, it was great on a nostalgic fantasy level. This was a world in which the individual didn\u2019t have all, or indeed any, of the answers. Allied to that, it was a world in which people hung out, went to parties, stayed late. Can you imagine anyone in a Cooper novel who had to get up early? They would be a laughing stock. Even Nafessa Williams as Cameron Cook, who introduces a US work ethic to the lolling Cotswold gentleman-amateurs \u2013 when she says she has to work, she means with a hangover, around brunch time, after scrambled eggs. From low-carb diets to stone-washed denim: was the fat-shaming for real? If you saw a wife in a modern drama, however satirical, who wouldn\u2019t allow her husband a potato, or a husband whose lip curled in disgust at the sight of his own (not even fat!) wife in underwear, you would say: this isn\u2019t a relationship; this is more like a jailer-inmate scenario. Interspousal snack-policing in Rivals is so intense that it drives two characters into one another\u2019s arms in \u2013 no spoilers, I promise \u2013 the most exquisite love story of the book. The 80s were different: there was no compunction about ridiculing fatness, no taboo around valorising thinness. \u201cMoments on the lips, for ever on the hips\u201d, \u201cyou can never be too rich or too thin\u201d \u2013 people had these supposed aphorisms as fridge magnets. Worse was women\u2019s magazines advising readers to stick a picture of yourself, fat, on your fridge door to discourage \u2026 eating? This doesn\u2019t work, by the way. My friend\u2019s mum used to cook with tape over her mouth. Another friend\u2019s mum used to douse the bin with washing-up liquid, in case she \u201caccidentally\u201d picked out leftovers and ate them. While Rosemary Conley was devising her hip-and-thigh diet, Callan Pinckney was inventing Callanetics, which opened, in 1984, with a photo of where your legs should meet if you were thin enough (ankles, mid-calf, knees, mid-thigh and nowhere else). So, yes, fat-shaming was a thing. Yet watching the parade of denim in Rivals, thinking how unflattering it all is \u2013 good grief, the dungarees, so formless, you can just about make out that someone inside them is alive \u2013 I realised that \u201cunflattering\u201d wasn\u2019t it.

      "body": "<p>Alexandra Morton-Hayward, a 35-year-old mortician turned molecular palaeontologist, had been behind the wheel of her rented Vauxhall for five hours, motoring across three countries, when a torrential storm broke loose on the plains of Belgium. Her wipers pulsed at full speed as the green fields of Flanders turned a blurry grey. Behind her sat a small, black picnic cooler. Within 24 hours, it would be full of human brains \u2013 not modern specimens, but brains that had contemplated this landscape as far back as the middle ages and had, miraculously, remained intact.</p> <p>For centuries, archaeologists have been perplexed by discoveries of ancient skeletons devoid of all soft tissue, except what Morton-Hayward cheerfully described as \u201cjust a brain rattling around in a skull\u201d. At Oxford, where she is a doctoral candidate, she has gathered the world\u2019s largest collection of ancient brains, some as old as 8,000 years. Additionally, after poring over centuries of scientific literature, she has tallied a staggering catalogue of cases \u2013 more than 4,400 preserved brains as old as 12,000 years. Using advanced<strong> </strong>technologies such as mass spectrometry and particle accelerators, she is leading a new effort to reveal the molecular secrets that have enabled some human brains to survive longer than Stonehenge or the Great Pyramid of Giza.</p> <p>This research may unlock not just the past, but present-day mysteries, too. Morton-Hayward has suggested that the molecular processes that damage our brains in life could help preserve them after death \u2013 a revelation that may reshape our understanding of ageing and neurodegenerative conditions.</p> <p>On that stormy day, Morton-Hayward had embarked on an expedition to collect 37 brains recently excavated from a medieval graveyard in Belgium. She radiated empathy and good humour as she chatted about slicing up cerebral matter. Gory body parts do not faze her. When she worked in the funeral trade, she handled thousands of corpses, hefting their organs and draining their fluids while talking amiably, as if her clients were still alive.</p> <p>As the rain intensified, Morton-Hayward slowed down. She felt a looming sense of dread, the approach of the affliction she calls \u201cthe werewolf\u201d. Flushing, she lifted a hand off the steering wheel and patted her cheek. \u201cI can feel my face getting hot,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI need some medication.\u201d Another storm was rising \u2013 this one inside her own skull. She suffers from nightly attacks of cluster headaches, which have been likened to being bludgeoned and repeatedly stabbed in the eye with an icepick. The fatigue of a long drive through foul weather had triggered an earlier than normal recurrence of her symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most painful conditions known to mankind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018suicide headache\u2019, because 40% of sufferers end up just wanting it to stop. In that sense, I\u2019m always aware of my brain. Sometimes, it feels like it\u2019s in worse shape than the ones I have on the bench in the lab.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Normally, the brain is our most fragile organ. Minutes after the loss of blood or oxygen supply, neurological damage begins, followed by decomposition. Hours after death, brain enzymes begin to consume cells from within, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/may/05/life-after-death\">a process called autolysis</a>. Within days, cellular membranes rupture and the brain liquefies. Eventually, the blood-brain barrier also fails and microbes invade to feast on the nutrient-rich soup \u2013 a foul-smelling process known as putrefaction or, in lay language, rotting. If the body lies exposed, maggots, insects or rodents also may scavenge the remains. Soon, only a hollow-eyed skull will remain. Decomposition occurs more slowly under water or underground (the deeper the burial, the slower), but most bodies skeletonise within five or 10 years.</p> <p>For all these reasons, scientists have been slow to recognise that brains can sometimes remain intact for thousands of years without any embalming, freezing or mineral fossilisation. Over generations, discoveries of ancient brains were often dismissed as bizarre curiosities, forgotten or simply discarded. Now, that\u2019s begun to change.</p> <p>At her lab in Oxford, Morton-Hayward keeps two refrigerators full of brains, housed in takeaway containers and plastic bags. More specimens sit in crates at room temperature. Above her desk, she keeps brain samples in cookie tins, vials and on glass slides. So vast is her collection that she has moved some specimens to off-site storage \u2013 enough to fill another three refrigerators. Mindful of tragic losses elsewhere, she bought a generator in case of a power cut. (In Florida, in 1986, one <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/10/26/florida-bog-reveals-8000-year-old-secrets/efaacbdf-0b89-42a8-841a-8cf16e8dd72e/\">collection of brains</a> from an 8,000-year-old burial site was destroyed when a freezer lost power.)</p>    <p>Over the past five years, Morton-Hayward has gathered more than 600 brains from scientists around the world. Her biggest jackpot \u2013 450 brains \u2013 came from a cemetery in south-west England that buried the dead from a workhouse, asylum and prisoners of war during the 18th and 19th centuries. Dozens more came from a mass grave in Philadelphia believed to hold victims of a yellow fever epidemic. The oldest sample of brain tissue comes from an unfortunate Swede whose head was bashed in, cut off and impaled on a pole 8,000 years ago. \u201cIn my experience, folks are super happy to just give it away,\u201d she said. \u201cSome archaeologists are really squeamish about the soft tissues.\u201d</p> <p>In the lab, she popped open a plastic container and gently coaxed out her \u201cshow dog\u201d, which she has named Rusty: a reddish brain with deep crevices from the workhouse graveyard. \u201cHe is my favourite,\u201d she said, nestling it in her gloves. \u201cApologies for the smell. It\u2019s formaldehyde.\u201d</p> <p>Something peculiar unites these brains: many come from people who ended their lives in misery. As Morton-Hayward explained, \u201cA lot of these sites where we find brains preserved are sites of suffering, quite honestly.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Morton-Hayward traces her fascination with the brain to a very specific time \u2013 when her own brain began to torture her. While studying archaeology at the University of St Andrews, she began suffering from crippling headaches. Doctors could find no cause. Eventually, an MRI scan revealed something unusual: part of her brain was collapsing into the hole where her spinal column enters the skull, a rare abnormality known as Chiari malformation.</p> <p>In her final year at St Andrews, Morton-Hayward underwent a delicate surgery to relieve the pressure on her brain. But the attacks continued. \u201cThey affect everything I do,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery waking moment.\u201d She dropped out of university and sank into depression. \u201cI didn\u2019t know why I was in so much pain,\u201d she said. \u201cI just felt completely useless, like I had totally failed.\u201d</p> <p>As it turned out, she also had a second brain condition: cluster headaches, one of the most painful afflictions known to medicine. In the <a href=\"https://medcraveonline.com/JNSK/why-cluster-headaches-are-called-quotsuicide-headachesquot.html\">Journal of Neurology and Stroke</a>, one patient described a cluster headache as a \u201clightning storm\u201d of pain that makes \u201cyour eye feel like it literally will explode out of your head\u201d. Usually recurring in spurts at the same time each day, cluster headaches leave patients in constant dread and often lead to secondary afflictions such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. The suicide rate for those suffering from cluster headaches is about 20 times higher than average. (The precise relationship between Morton-Hayward\u2019s two conditions remains nebulous. \u201cThere\u2019s so little we know about the brain, it\u2019s staggering,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I find that terrifying, and sometimes I find that really comforting.\u201d)</p> <p>Over time, Morton-Hayward\u2019s agony became unbearable. She tried to kill herself and woke up in hospital. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a pragmatist,\u201d she said, quietly. \u201cI was like: \u2018That didn\u2019t work, so let\u2019s try something else. Let\u2019s try living.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After leaving university, she moved from job to job: trauma nurse, grief counsellor, dishwasher and wedding planner (which she found utterly depressing, because she said couples worried more about the tablecloths than marrying the right person). Desperate for something new, she applied for an opening at a undertakers in Rochester, Kent, run by a mortician who had worked in the industry since the age of 15. The interview went well, and the director showed her around. He took her to the chapel of rest, a quiet parlour with curtains and soft music where families bid farewell to their loved ones. To her surprise, Morton-Hayward saw an open casket containing the body of an elderly woman. \u201cThe director put his hands on the side of the coffin and just talked to me over this body,\u201d she said. It was the first time she had seen a dead person. \u201cI wasn\u2019t shocked, but I was like, <em>this is weird</em>. I was more struck by how comfortable he clearly was.\u201d She came to see the episode was a test of whether she would be comfortable working with the dead. The answer was yes. \u201cIt was the most fun job I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said.</p>    <p>Over the next five years, Morton-Hayward would care for more than 5,000 deceased people. She helped plan memorial services, dressed the dead for open-casket funerals, sewed mouths shut to prevent the grimace caused by rigor mortis, placed plastic caps beneath eyelids to make bodies appear peacefully asleep, and learned to embalm \u2013 making incisions in the femoral artery to drain the body fluids before pumping in preservatives. Her own ordeals had acquainted her with suffering and death, and she exuded a natural empathy for her clients. \u201cWhen someone passes away \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter how old they were or whether it was expected \u2013 it\u2019s devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cThe funeral director can become the focus of grief, anger and frustration, because you\u2019re the one telling the family that they need to let go of their loved one and they need to bury them. But that anger always turns into gratitude.\u201d</p> <p>She began pondering the mysteries of dead bodies. \u201cYou know their favourite memory, their favourite colour and these sorts of things,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you have them on a mortuary table and you have that brain in your hand and you wonder: where is that memory stored?\u201d She found herself fascinated by death and decomposition, and how one might study it scientifically. \u201cI never thought of myself as a scientist, which is why I went back to school,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Despite her fragile health, in 2015 Morton-Hayward enrolled in online classes through the Open University to finish her undergraduate degree. Once haunted by the shame of dropping out, she began to redeem herself as a student, graduating with honours and winning a prize for her undergraduate dissertation about the testimony of forensic experts in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/22/the-guardian-view-on-war-crimes-trials-justice-for-srebrenicas-victims\">Srebrenica war crime trials</a> at The Hague. She started to feel that she wasn\u2019t an academic failure. Maybe she could even balance a scientific career alongside her neurological disorders? In 2018, she switched to working nights at the funeral directors, and began a master\u2019s in bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology at University College London (UCL). \u201cI got tired of putting people in the ground and decided I wanted to start digging them up,\u201d she joked.</p> <p>It was during her graduate studies that Morton-Hayward came across an oddity that would change the course of her life. Years earlier, archaeologists made a series of discoveries that contradicted everything Morton-Hayward had come to expect from her years in the funeral business. She became intrigued by another aspect of death.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In 1994, a plainspoken archaeologist named <a href=\"https://bradford.academia.edu/SoniaOConnor\">Sonia O\u2019Connor</a> was summoned to an excavation site in Hull, where about 250 graves from a medieval monastery were being exhumed. The dig revealed many surprises: ancient underwear, skeletons with evidence of syphilis, a massive coffin whose oak planks preserved the imprint of a corpulent man described by the chief archaeologist as \u201cthe stereotype image of Friar Tuck\u201d. But nothing prepared the excavators for the moment when a skull broke apart, revealing a grey-brown mass. When O\u2019Connor came to inspect the unusual specimen, she found a shrunken and discoloured organ with two cerebral hemispheres and telltale surface folds. \u201cI thought, this is a brain!\u201d she recalled. But that seemed beyond belief: the body had been buried for more than 400 years.</p> <p>With the help of Don Brothwell, a forensic expert who also investigated mass graves in the Balkans, O\u2019Connor found that one in every 10 skulls from the site held a preserved brain. Shrunken, spongy or crumbly to the touch, most were brown or rust-coloured with patches of black. The best-preserved brains came from the wettest parts of the site, and many were circled by mysterious orange deposits in the soil. These brains had not been preserved by known means such as dehydration, mummification or natural tanning in acidic waters. No other soft tissues remained except the brains. \u201cIf you talk to pathologists, they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s the first organ in the body to go to liquid,\u201d O\u2019Connor said of the brain. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the opposite of that.\u201d</p> <p>Some experts O\u2019Connor consulted were sceptical. One suggested her so-called brains might be just fungus. But the more she looked into it, the more certain O\u2019Connor became. In those days, the internet was in its infancy and O\u2019Connor could find only a few other reports of preserved brains. In the late 18th century, French authorities found decades-old brains when they moved the largest graveyard in Paris, the foul-smelling Cimeti\u00e8re des Saints-Innocents. \u201cIn considering this singular ability to so strongly resist destruction, one cannot help but be astonished,\u201d the physician Michel-Augustin Thouret wrote in 1791 after inspecting the bodies. The skeletons were transported to the underground quarries now known as the Catacombs and the brains were largely forgotten. In 1902, Grafton Elliot Smith, an Australian British anatomist, reported the excavation of a pre-dynastic cemetery in Egypt with nearly 500 graves with preserved brains. \u201cAnatomists and anthropologists seem to be not only ignorant of this fact,\u201d he lamented, \u201cbut even deny the possibility of its occurrence.\u201d</p> <p>Soon, O\u2019Connor learned of more preserved brains in Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands and the US. Somehow these amazing finds never got much attention or were simply thrown away, leaving future scholars to be surprised anew each time more ancient specimens appeared. Then came the most famous discovery of all. In the summer of 2008, a team of archaeologists with the York Archaeological Trust were excavating a network of drainage channels from the iron age near the <a href=\"https://ffhyork.weebly.com/heslington-archaeology.html\">village of </a><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440311000690\">Heslington</a>, when they found a dark-stained skull lying face-down in the clay. While cleaning the skull, a lab technician felt something thump inside the cavity and spotted a yellow, spongy clump. As it happened, the lab worker had been one of O\u2019Connor\u2019s students and remembered her lecture about preserved ancient brains. She phoned her former instructor, who later confirmed that the Heslington find was indeed a brain.</p>    <p>O\u2019Connor assembled a multidisciplinary team of scientists and gradually they pieced together a grisly story, which they published in a 2011 paper in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-archaeological-science\">Journal of Archaeological Science</a>. The skull was about 2,500 years old and belonged to an adult male who had been hanged, decapitated and dropped into a small pond. Other than one small finger bone, there was no sign of the rest of the body. The only remaining soft tissue was the brain \u2013 the oldest one ever found in the UK.</p> <p>After the discovery was reported in the news, O\u2019Connor got a call from Axel Petzold, a neurologist at UCL who studied degenerative diseases in living patients. Many of these conditions involved protein pathologies and he wondered if similar aggregations of abnormal proteins might have persisted in the Heslington brain, or even helped conserve it. He convinced O\u2019Connor to give him a sample, and over the next decade the UCL team identified more than 800 proteins in the ancient brain \u2013 the most ever discovered in an archaeological specimen. Somehow the proteins had formed stubborn aggregations that preserved the brain for more than two millennia.</p> <p>For Morton-Hayward, the studies of the Heslington brain were \u201cmind-blowing\u201d. The very idea of a 2,500-year-old brain defied everything she knew. Even in a chilled mortuary, brains typically began to liquefy within a few days. How could an ancient brain remain intact? She ended up doing her master\u2019s dissertation on protein preservation in ancient brains. Soon, she began a collaboration with O\u2019Connor. Morton-Hayward spent the pandemic teaching herself about proteomics (the study of proteins) and began compiling reports of preserved brains dating back to the 17th century. She had found a topic for her PhD: identifying the cellular and molecular processes that allow neural tissues to resist decay \u2013 in other words, discovering underlying causes of brain preservation.</p> <p>But after starting her doctoral studies at Cambridge, Morton-Hayward had a falling out with her adviser and had to fight to transfer her project to Oxford. For a time, she feared her new career would collapse. It was another bleak time \u2013 made darker by nightly attacks of cluster headaches. \u201cMany students would not be able to cope with the ailments and setbacks she has faced,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/12/dinosaur-data-can-the-bones-of-the-deep-past-help-predict-extinctions-of-the-future\">Erin Saupe</a>, an Oxford professor of palaeobiology and one of her current advisers. \u201cShe seems to get a lot of joy out of the process of discovery, which must drive her forward.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>To the naked eye, ancient brains look much like normal brains, just discoloured and shrunken. Viewed under a microscope, however, one can see remains of neurofilaments \u2013 essentially, the wreckage of the structural framework of the brain. \u201cIt\u2019s like a spider web,\u201d Morton-Hayward said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of empty space, which is really strange because they look so solid.\u201d</p> <p>Her work focuses on deciphering the molecular processes that occur after death and preserve brain tissue. She uses mass spectrometry to identify which amino acids and proteins persist in the ancient tissues (the most common is myelin basic protein, part of the fatty insulation of the neural wiring). She also took brain tissues to the <a href=\"https://www.harwellcampus.com/facilities/diamond-light-source/\">Diamond Light Source synchrotron at Harwell</a>, the UK national particle accelerator, and spent 19-hour shifts bombarding them with electrons travelling at almost the speed of light to identify the metals, molecules and minerals associated with the preserved brains.</p> <p>She also has conducted experiments to compare brain decomposition in different burial environments. She put dead mice in jars of either water or quartz powder to investigate how the brains decayed over a six-month period. Over time, she observed a proportional increase in myelin proteins \u2013 the same ones she had found in abundance in ancient brains. \u201cWe find brains preferentially preserved in waterlogged, oxygen-poor environments in the mouse-decay experiment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, because these are the same environments in which we find human brains preserved.\u201d</p> <p>These analyses all point to one underlying cause: a phenomenon called <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.2606\">molecular cross-linking</a>. She posits that fragments of brain proteins and degraded lipids bind with metals to form a spongy material that resists decay. The cross-linking drives out water \u2013 explaining why preserved brains are typically shrunken \u2013 and forms durable polymers that persist through time. Because the brain abounds with proteins and lipids, it offers what Morton-Hayward described as an \u201cideal mixture\u201d of ingredients for this odd natural preservation.</p> <p>This process can be catalysed by metals, particularly iron. Indeed, preserved brains turn out to be loaded with iron \u2013 up to 25% in some cases. It is the minerals containing iron that make ancient brains yellow, black, orange or red, like Rusty.</p> <p>In living brains, iron supports essential functions, such as respiration and electron transport. But iron also can be dangerous because it accumulates with age and can promote a phenomenon known as oxidative damage. Oxidative damage has been implicated in ageing, neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, and other brain pathologies. In fact, Morton-Hayward\u2019s work suggests that oxidative stress during life may jumpstart a process that continues after death, with greater cross-linking in certain conditions such as low-oxygen, waterlogged burials. She is struck by the fact that many preserved brains come from people whose lives ended miserably \u2013 in mass graves, traumatic deaths, workhouses and asylums.</p>    <p>\u201cAny kind of physiological stress \u2013 like starvation, for example \u2013 and you will age faster and die younger,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why we have so many brains from sites where there is suffering and deprivation.\u201d In other words, the processes that in life accelerate ageing continue after death. The result is a cruel irony \u2013 the very thing that might have driven someone to lose their mind in life might preserve some brains after death.</p> <p>In March 2024, Morton-Hayward published the initial results of her research in <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspb\">Proceedings of the Royal Society B</a>.<strong> </strong>After the paper\u2019s publication, Morton-Hayward spent days doing back-to-back interviews with media from around the world including CNN, the BBC, the New Scientist and Science. \u201cWe\u2019ve got it to the point where it is now a serious topic of study and that is wonderful,\u201d the now-retired O\u2019Connor said. She is delighted to see Morton-Hayward continue the work. \u201cThat a PhD student is wanting to take this forward is brilliant \u2013 somebody who can understand the chemistry, the physics, the genetics, all these things.\u201d One of Morton-Hayward\u2019s advisers, Prof Greger Larson, mentioned that one of her \u201csuperpowers\u201d is her ability to \u201cto reach out and befriend experts in a wide variety of different fields\u201d. He added: \u201cA lot of people are assisting her, but she\u2019s clearly the hub.\u201d</p> <p>Yet few know of the medical torments Morton-Hayward has endured to reach this point. The cluster headache attacks follow a predictable pattern in the wee hours of the night. Her eyes and nose start running, her cheeks flush hot and one side of her face droops as she feels a pounding agony. She cannot lie down: any pressure on the back of her head becomes unbearable. Her fiance, Richard Thomas, a postdoctoral researcher in geosciences at Oxford, can only watch helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s quite horrible,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do at all.\u201d</p> <p>Every three months, Morton-Hayward receives injections of nerve blocks into the back of her head; the pain gets worse for a week before it gets better. She takes triptans, which dilate her blood vessels and reduce the pain. She takes steroids when her workload is high, but only for short stretches due to the risks of long-term use. At home, she keeps oxygen tanks and a vagus nerve stimulator. \u201cIt affects your heart because of the constant stress of being in such pain,\u201d she said, \u201cso now I have to take heart medication as well.\u201d Perhaps her best defence is a practice of mindful detachment. \u201cNothing relieves it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only option is to not feel it, to imagine you are not in your own body. You put it outside yourself.\u201d</p> <p>As dawn breaks, the werewolf retreats. \u201cI have a sort of amnesia,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way you live with it is you forget how bad the pain was. I think it\u2019s your body\u2019s learned response. Otherwise you would not be able to carry on. You would never lie down to sleep, knowing what was coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI try to tell her to rest, and she\u2019s like: \u2018No, I have a PhD to do!\u2019\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI definitely would have given up by now.\u201d He has assumed the role of caretaker, including making sure she eats properly. \u201cShe will try to work all hours of the day, all the time,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI think she lived off toast before I met her \u2013 toast and beer.\u201d</p> <p>The relentless pace takes a toll. Last year, Morton-Hayward experienced severe abdominal pains, which she ignored. But it turned out to be an ovarian abscess, and the infection spread throughout her body, leading to sepsis. She spent two weeks in hospital and underwent blood and iron transfusions. \u201cOn the third day, this big team came rushing into the ward, super panicked,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy haemoglobin numbers were so low that they expected to see somebody in cardiac arrest.\u201d</p> <p>In April, shortly after the publication of her paper, Morton-Hayward travelled to a conference in New Orleans to give a presentation and enjoy a holiday with Thomas. By the end of the trip, she had developed a cough. During the flight home her breathing weakened. On landing, she headed straight to A&amp;E, where she discovered she had pneumonia. She went back into hospital. \u201cI\u2019m really sick of being sick,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Even as her brain and body conspired against her, Morton-Hayward pushed forward. Nobody better understands the preciousness of time, the urgency, than someone one with a grave illness who has come close to death.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One morning a few weeks after her bout with pneumonia, Morton-Hayward picked up her picnic cooler and set out in pursuit of more specimens. She made the long drive from Oxford to Belgium in stormy weather. As usual, her attacks came overnight, this time as she was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Ghent.</p> <p>Over breakfast the next day, she pulled out her phone and glanced at a ghoulish photo of a brain from a medieval churchyard. Stowing the cooler in the back of the car, she drove through the Belgian countryside. Long barges ploughed through canals and giant freighters stacked with shipping containers loomed over the quays. Lowlands were a boom not only for shipping: waterlogged soils also preserved brains and, today, a cheerful reaper had come to harvest them.</p> <p>On these plains, one did not have to dig deep to find human remains. Hundreds of thousands died here in the first world war, as immortalised in a famous poem by John McCrae: \u201cIn Flanders fields the poppies blow / Between the crosses, row on row.\u201d<em> </em></p> <p>After a short drive, Morton-Hayward arrived at the offices of an archaeological firm, BAAC. Nandy Dolman, an archaeologist, led Morton-Hayward into a cavernous warehouse of the dead. Tall shelves were stacked with cardboard boxes containing thousands of skeletons dating back to the medieval period.</p> <p>Since 2020, the firm had been exhuming the cemetery of St Martin\u2019s Church, a famous landmark in Ypres dating back to the 13th century. To make way for an urban construction project, about 1,300 skeletons had been removed, including scores with preserved cerebral matter. On a previous visit Morton-Hayward had collected 55 brains, and had returned for the final 37, packed in plastic bags labelled Monster \u2013 which is Dutch for \u201csample\u201d.</p> <p>In a conference room upstairs, Dolman gave a detailed presentation about the graves of Flemish people who might have lived during the era depicted by the painters Pieter Bruegel the Elder and his namesake son. She believes the preserved brains span hundreds of years, as far back as the 12th century. Skeletons had been documented with geolocation, photographs and data including sex, approximate age and whether the skulls contained brains. Dolman showed photos of bones with the distinctive blue and red stains \u2013 indications of iron, the metal<strong> </strong>suspected of catalysing brain preservation. \u201cThe documentation, the metadata \u2013 this is tip-top,\u201d Morton-Hayward said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/24/queen-of-crime-solving-angela-gallop-forensic-science\">The queen of crime-solving</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then Dolman revealed a surprise: the newly found brains included those of 20 children. Morton-Hayward opened her mouth and eyes wide in astonishment. Until then, she had only a single juvenile in her collection of 600 preserved brains. Could children too have suffered extreme neurological stress and accelerated brain ageing? Perhaps during a famine? Or was another mechanism at work? As countless scientists have discovered, every advance only generates more questions. \u201cI\u2019ll write up these notes tomorrow and go through my monsters,\u201d she told her colleague just before bidding farewell. She had a long journey ahead across three countries, hoping to arrive home before the werewolf returned.</p> <p>In Flanders fields, the grasses blew beside the parking lot as Morton-Hayward returned to the car carrying the remains of three dozen souls who, centuries before, watched sunsets glow over these plains. Why had they persisted so long? Were everlasting brains the rewards for their agonies? Once silent in the grave, now they would speak again, thanks to someone who had also, against the odds, endured.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on X at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, listen to our podcasts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read\">here</a> and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alexandra Morton-Hayward, a 35-year-old mortician turned molecular palaeontologist, had been behind the wheel of her rented Vauxhall for five hours, motoring across three countries, when a torrential storm broke loose on the plains of Belgium. Her wipers pulsed at full speed as the green fields of Flanders turned a blurry grey. Behind her sat a small, black picnic cooler. Within 24 hours, it would be full of human brains \u2013 not modern specimens, but brains that had contemplated this landscape as far back as the middle ages and had, miraculously, remained intact. For centuries, archaeologists have been perplexed by discoveries of ancient skeletons devoid of all soft tissue, except what Morton-Hayward cheerfully described as \u201cjust a brain rattling around in a skull\u201d. At Oxford, where she is a doctoral candidate, she has gathered the world\u2019s largest collection of ancient brains, some as old as 8,000 years. Additionally, after poring over centuries of scientific literature, she has tallied a staggering catalogue of cases \u2013 more than 4,400 preserved brains as old as 12,000 years. Using advanced technologies such as mass spectrometry and particle accelerators, she is leading a new effort to reveal the molecular secrets that have enabled some human brains to survive longer than Stonehenge or the Great Pyramid of Giza. This research may unlock not just the past, but present-day mysteries, too. Morton-Hayward has suggested that the molecular processes that damage our brains in life could help preserve them after death \u2013 a revelation that may reshape our understanding of ageing and neurodegenerative conditions. On that stormy day, Morton-Hayward had embarked on an expedition to collect 37 brains recently excavated from a medieval graveyard in Belgium. She radiated empathy and good humour as she chatted about slicing up cerebral matter. Gory body parts do not faze her. When she worked in the funeral trade, she handled thousands of corpses, hefting their organs and draining their fluids while talking amiably, as if her clients were still alive. As the rain intensified, Morton-Hayward slowed down. She felt a looming sense of dread, the approach of the affliction she calls \u201cthe werewolf\u201d. Flushing, she lifted a hand off the steering wheel and patted her cheek. \u201cI can feel my face getting hot,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI need some medication.\u201d Another storm was rising \u2013 this one inside her own skull. She suffers from nightly attacks of cluster headaches, which have been likened to being bludgeoned and repeatedly stabbed in the eye with an icepick. The fatigue of a long drive through foul weather had triggered an earlier than normal recurrence of her symptoms. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most painful conditions known to mankind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018suicide headache\u2019, because 40% of sufferers end up just wanting it to stop. In that sense, I\u2019m always aware of my brain. Sometimes, it feels like it\u2019s in worse shape than the ones I have on the bench in the lab.\u201d * * * Normally, the brain is our most fragile organ. Minutes after the loss of blood or oxygen supply, neurological damage begins, followed by decomposition. Hours after death, brain enzymes begin to consume cells from within, a process called autolysis. Within days, cellular membranes rupture and the brain liquefies. Eventually, the blood-brain barrier also fails and microbes invade to feast on the nutrient-rich soup \u2013 a foul-smelling process known as putrefaction or, in lay language, rotting. If the body lies exposed, maggots, insects or rodents also may scavenge the remains. Soon, only a hollow-eyed skull will remain. Decomposition occurs more slowly under water or underground (the deeper the burial, the slower), but most bodies skeletonise within five or 10 years. For all these reasons, scientists have been slow to recognise that brains can sometimes remain intact for thousands of years without any embalming, freezing or mineral fossilisation. Over generations, discoveries of ancient brains were often dismissed as bizarre curiosities, forgotten or simply discarded. Now, that\u2019s begun to change. At her lab in Oxford, Morton-Hayward keeps two refrigerators full of brains, housed in takeaway containers and plastic bags. More specimens sit in crates at room temperature. Above her desk, she keeps brain samples in cookie tins, vials and on glass slides. So vast is her collection that she has moved some specimens to off-site storage \u2013 enough to fill another three refrigerators. Mindful of tragic losses elsewhere, she bought a generator in case of a power cut. (In Florida, in 1986, one collection of brains from an 8,000-year-old burial site was destroyed when a freezer lost power.) Over the past five years, Morton-Hayward has gathered more than 600 brains from scientists around the world. Her biggest jackpot \u2013 450 brains \u2013 came from a cemetery in south-west England that buried the dead from a workhouse, asylum and prisoners of war during the 18th and 19th centuries. Dozens more came from a mass grave in Philadelphia believed to hold victims of a yellow fever epidemic. The oldest sample of brain tissue comes from an unfortunate Swede whose head was bashed in, cut off and impaled on a pole 8,000 years ago. \u201cIn my experience, folks are super happy to just give it away,\u201d she said. \u201cSome archaeologists are really squeamish about the soft tissues.\u201d In the lab, she popped open a plastic container and gently coaxed out her \u201cshow dog\u201d, which she has named Rusty: a reddish brain with deep crevices from the workhouse graveyard. \u201cHe is my favourite,\u201d she said, nestling it in her gloves. \u201cApologies for the smell. It\u2019s formaldehyde.\u201d Something peculiar unites these brains: many come from people who ended their lives in misery. As Morton-Hayward explained, \u201cA lot of these sites where we find brains preserved are sites of suffering, quite honestly.\u201d * * * Morton-Hayward traces her fascination with the brain to a very specific time \u2013 when her own brain began to torture her. While studying archaeology at the University of St Andrews, she began suffering from crippling headaches. Doctors could find no cause. Eventually, an MRI scan revealed something unusual: part of her brain was collapsing into the hole where her spinal column enters the skull, a rare abnormality known as Chiari malformation. In her final year at St Andrews, Morton-Hayward underwent a delicate surgery to relieve the pressure on her brain. But the attacks continued. \u201cThey affect everything I do,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery waking moment.\u201d She dropped out of university and sank into depression. \u201cI didn\u2019t know why I was in so much pain,\u201d she said. \u201cI just felt completely useless, like I had totally failed.\u201d As it turned out, she also had a second brain condition: cluster headaches, one of the most painful afflictions known to medicine. In the Journal of Neurology and Stroke, one patient described a cluster headache as a \u201clightning storm\u201d of pain that makes \u201cyour eye feel like it literally will explode out of your head\u201d. Usually recurring in spurts at the same time each day, cluster headaches leave patients in constant dread and often lead to secondary afflictions such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. The suicide rate for those suffering from cluster headaches is about 20 times higher than average. (The precise relationship between Morton-Hayward\u2019s two conditions remains nebulous. \u201cThere\u2019s so little we know about the brain, it\u2019s staggering,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I find that terrifying, and sometimes I find that really comforting.\u201d) Over time, Morton-Hayward\u2019s agony became unbearable. She tried to kill herself and woke up in hospital. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a pragmatist,\u201d she said, quietly. \u201cI was like: \u2018That didn\u2019t work, so let\u2019s try something else. Let\u2019s try living.\u2019\u201d After leaving university, she moved from job to job: trauma nurse, grief counsellor, dishwasher and wedding planner (which she found utterly depressing, because she said couples worried more about the tablecloths than marrying the right person). Desperate for something new, she applied for an opening at a undertakers in Rochester, Kent, run by a mortician who had worked in the industry since the age of 15. The interview went well, and the director showed her around. He took her to the chapel of rest, a quiet parlour with curtains and soft music where families bid farewell to their loved ones. To her surprise, Morton-Hayward saw an open casket containing the body of an elderly woman. \u201cThe director put his hands on the side of the coffin and just talked to me over this body,\u201d she said. It was the first time she had seen a dead person. \u201cI wasn\u2019t shocked, but I was like, this is weird. I was more struck by how comfortable he clearly was.\u201d She came to see the episode was a test of whether she would be comfortable working with the dead. The answer was yes. \u201cIt was the most fun job I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said. Over the next five years, Morton-Hayward would care for more than 5,000 deceased people. She helped plan memorial services, dressed the dead for open-casket funerals, sewed mouths shut to prevent the grimace caused by rigor mortis, placed plastic caps beneath eyelids to make bodies appear peacefully asleep, and learned to embalm \u2013 making incisions in the femoral artery to drain the body fluids before pumping in preservatives. Her own ordeals had acquainted her with suffering and death, and she exuded a natural empathy for her clients. \u201cWhen someone passes away \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter how old they were or whether it was expected \u2013 it\u2019s devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cThe funeral director can become the focus of grief, anger and frustration, because you\u2019re the one telling the family that they need to let go of their loved one and they need to bury them. But that anger always turns into gratitude.\u201d She began pondering the mysteries of dead bodies. \u201cYou know their favourite memory, their favourite colour and these sorts of things,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you have them on a mortuary table and you have that brain in your hand and you wonder: where is that memory stored?\u201d She found herself fascinated by death and decomposition, and how one might study it scientifically. \u201cI never thought of myself as a scientist, which is why I went back to school,\u201d she said. Despite her fragile health, in 2015 Morton-Hayward enrolled in online classes through the Open University to finish her undergraduate degree. Once haunted by the shame of dropping out, she began to redeem herself as a student, graduating with honours and winning a prize for her undergraduate dissertation about the testimony of forensic experts in the Srebrenica war crime trials at The Hague. She started to feel that she wasn\u2019t an academic failure. Maybe she could even balance a scientific career alongside her neurological disorders? In 2018, she switched to working nights at the funeral directors, and began a master\u2019s in bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology at University College London (UCL). \u201cI got tired of putting people in the ground and decided I wanted to start digging them up,\u201d she joked. It was during her graduate studies that Morton-Hayward came across an oddity that would change the course of her life. Years earlier, archaeologists made a series of discoveries that contradicted everything Morton-Hayward had come to expect from her years in the funeral business. She became intrigued by another aspect of death. * * * In 1994, a plainspoken archaeologist named Sonia O\u2019Connor was summoned to an excavation site in Hull, where about 250 graves from a medieval monastery were being exhumed. The dig revealed many surprises: ancient underwear, skeletons with evidence of syphilis, a massive coffin whose oak planks preserved the imprint of a corpulent man described by the chief archaeologist as \u201cthe stereotype image of Friar Tuck\u201d. But nothing prepared the excavators for the moment when a skull broke apart, revealing a grey-brown mass. When O\u2019Connor came to inspect the unusual specimen, she found a shrunken and discoloured organ with two cerebral hemispheres and telltale surface folds. \u201cI thought, this is a brain!\u201d she recalled. But that seemed beyond belief: the body had been buried for more than 400 years. With the help of Don Brothwell, a forensic expert who also investigated mass graves in the Balkans, O\u2019Connor found that one in every 10 skulls from the site held a preserved brain. Shrunken, spongy or crumbly to the touch, most were brown or rust-coloured with patches of black. The best-preserved brains came from the wettest parts of the site, and many were circled by mysterious orange deposits in the soil. These brains had not been preserved by known means such as dehydration, mummification or natural tanning in acidic waters. No other soft tissues remained except the brains. \u201cIf you talk to pathologists, they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s the first organ in the body to go to liquid,\u201d O\u2019Connor said of the brain. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the opposite of that.\u201d Some experts O\u2019Connor consulted were sceptical. One suggested her so-called brains might be just fungus. But the more she looked into it, the more certain O\u2019Connor became. In those days, the internet was in its infancy and O\u2019Connor could find only a few other reports of preserved brains. In the late 18th century, French authorities found decades-old brains when they moved the largest graveyard in Paris, the foul-smelling Cimeti\u00e8re des Saints-Innocents. \u201cIn considering this singular ability to so strongly resist destruction, one cannot help but be astonished,\u201d the physician Michel-Augustin Thouret wrote in 1791 after inspecting the bodies. The skeletons were transported to the underground quarries now known as the Catacombs and the brains were largely forgotten. In 1902, Grafton Elliot Smith, an Australian British anatomist, reported the excavation of a pre-dynastic cemetery in Egypt with nearly 500 graves with preserved brains. \u201cAnatomists and anthropologists seem to be not only ignorant of this fact,\u201d he lamented, \u201cbut even deny the possibility of its occurrence.\u201d Soon, O\u2019Connor learned of more preserved brains in Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands and the US. Somehow these amazing finds never got much attention or were simply thrown away, leaving future scholars to be surprised anew each time more ancient specimens appeared. Then came the most famous discovery of all. In the summer of 2008, a team of archaeologists with the York Archaeological Trust were excavating a network of drainage channels from the iron age near the village of Heslington, when they found a dark-stained skull lying face-down in the clay. While cleaning the skull, a lab technician felt something thump inside the cavity and spotted a yellow, spongy clump. As it happened, the lab worker had been one of O\u2019Connor\u2019s students and remembered her lecture about preserved ancient brains. She phoned her former instructor, who later confirmed that the Heslington find was indeed a brain. O\u2019Connor assembled a multidisciplinary team of scientists and gradually they pieced together a grisly story, which they published in a 2011 paper in the Journal of Archaeological Science. The skull was about 2,500 years old and belonged to an adult male who had been hanged, decapitated and dropped into a small pond. Other than one small finger bone, there was no sign of the rest of the body. The only remaining soft tissue was the brain \u2013 the oldest one ever found in the UK. After the discovery was reported in the news, O\u2019Connor got a call from Axel Petzold, a neurologist at UCL who studied degenerative diseases in living patients. Many of these conditions involved protein pathologies and he wondered if similar aggregations of abnormal proteins might have persisted in the Heslington brain, or even helped conserve it. He convinced O\u2019Connor to give him a sample, and over the next decade the UCL team identified more than 800 proteins in the ancient brain \u2013 the most ever discovered in an archaeological specimen. Somehow the proteins had formed stubborn aggregations that preserved the brain for more than two millennia. For Morton-Hayward, the studies of the Heslington brain were \u201cmind-blowing\u201d. The very idea of a 2,500-year-old brain defied everything she knew. Even in a chilled mortuary, brains typically began to liquefy within a few days. How could an ancient brain remain intact? She ended up doing her master\u2019s dissertation on protein preservation in ancient brains. Soon, she began a collaboration with O\u2019Connor. Morton-Hayward spent the pandemic teaching herself about proteomics (the study of proteins) and began compiling reports of preserved brains dating back to the 17th century. She had found a topic for her PhD: identifying the cellular and molecular processes that allow neural tissues to resist decay \u2013 in other words, discovering underlying causes of brain preservation. But after starting her doctoral studies at Cambridge, Morton-Hayward had a falling out with her adviser and had to fight to transfer her project to Oxford. For a time, she feared her new career would collapse. It was another bleak time \u2013 made darker by nightly attacks of cluster headaches. \u201cMany students would not be able to cope with the ailments and setbacks she has faced,\u201d said Erin Saupe, an Oxford professor of palaeobiology and one of her current advisers. \u201cShe seems to get a lot of joy out of the process of discovery, which must drive her forward.\u201d * * * To the naked eye, ancient brains look much like normal brains, just discoloured and shrunken. Viewed under a microscope, however, one can see remains of neurofilaments \u2013 essentially, the wreckage of the structural framework of the brain. \u201cIt\u2019s like a spider web,\u201d Morton-Hayward said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of empty space, which is really strange because they look so solid.\u201d Her work focuses on deciphering the molecular processes that occur after death and preserve brain tissue. She uses mass spectrometry to identify which amino acids and proteins persist in the ancient tissues (the most common is myelin basic protein, part of the fatty insulation of the neural wiring). She also took brain tissues to the Diamond Light Source synchrotron at Harwell, the UK national particle accelerator, and spent 19-hour shifts bombarding them with electrons travelling at almost the speed of light to identify the metals, molecules and minerals associated with the preserved brains. She also has conducted experiments to compare brain decomposition in different burial environments. She put dead mice in jars of either water or quartz powder to investigate how the brains decayed over a six-month period. Over time, she observed a proportional increase in myelin proteins \u2013 the same ones she had found in abundance in ancient brains. \u201cWe find brains preferentially preserved in waterlogged, oxygen-poor environments in the mouse-decay experiment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, because these are the same environments in which we find human brains preserved.\u201d These analyses all point to one underlying cause: a phenomenon called molecular cross-linking. She posits that fragments of brain proteins and degraded lipids bind with metals to form a spongy material that resists decay. The cross-linking drives out water \u2013 explaining why preserved brains are typically shrunken \u2013 and forms durable polymers that persist through time. Because the brain abounds with proteins and lipids, it offers what Morton-Hayward described as an \u201cideal mixture\u201d of ingredients for this odd natural preservation. This process can be catalysed by metals, particularly iron. Indeed, preserved brains turn out to be loaded with iron \u2013 up to 25% in some cases. It is the minerals containing iron that make ancient brains yellow, black, orange or red, like Rusty. In living brains, iron supports essential functions, such as respiration and electron transport. But iron also can be dangerous because it accumulates with age and can promote a phenomenon known as oxidative damage. Oxidative damage has been implicated in ageing, neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, and other brain pathologies. In fact, Morton-Hayward\u2019s work suggests that oxidative stress during life may jumpstart a process that continues after death, with greater cross-linking in certain conditions such as low-oxygen, waterlogged burials. She is struck by the fact that many preserved brains come from people whose lives ended miserably \u2013 in mass graves, traumatic deaths, workhouses and asylums. \u201cAny kind of physiological stress \u2013 like starvation, for example \u2013 and you will age faster and die younger,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why we have so many brains from sites where there is suffering and deprivation.\u201d In other words, the processes that in life accelerate ageing continue after death. The result is a cruel irony \u2013 the very thing that might have driven someone to lose their mind in life might preserve some brains after death. In March 2024, Morton-Hayward published the initial results of her research in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. After the paper\u2019s publication, Morton-Hayward spent days doing back-to-back interviews with media from around the world including CNN, the BBC, the New Scientist and Science. \u201cWe\u2019ve got it to the point where it is now a serious topic of study and that is wonderful,\u201d the now-retired O\u2019Connor said. She is delighted to see Morton-Hayward continue the work. \u201cThat a PhD student is wanting to take this forward is brilliant \u2013 somebody who can understand the chemistry, the physics, the genetics, all these things.\u201d One of Morton-Hayward\u2019s advisers, Prof Greger Larson, mentioned that one of her \u201csuperpowers\u201d is her ability to \u201cto reach out and befriend experts in a wide variety of different fields\u201d. He added: \u201cA lot of people are assisting her, but she\u2019s clearly the hub.\u201d Yet few know of the medical torments Morton-Hayward has endured to reach this point. The cluster headache attacks follow a predictable pattern in the wee hours of the night. Her eyes and nose start running, her cheeks flush hot and one side of her face droops as she feels a pounding agony. She cannot lie down: any pressure on the back of her head becomes unbearable. Her fiance, Richard Thomas, a postdoctoral researcher in geosciences at Oxford, can only watch helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s quite horrible,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do at all.\u201d Every three months, Morton-Hayward receives injections of nerve blocks into the back of her head; the pain gets worse for a week before it gets better. She takes triptans, which dilate her blood vessels and reduce the pain. She takes steroids when her workload is high, but only for short stretches due to the risks of long-term use. At home, she keeps oxygen tanks and a vagus nerve stimulator. \u201cIt affects your heart because of the constant stress of being in such pain,\u201d she said, \u201cso now I have to take heart medication as well.\u201d Perhaps her best defence is a practice of mindful detachment. \u201cNothing relieves it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only option is to not feel it, to imagine you are not in your own body. You put it outside yourself.\u201d As dawn breaks, the werewolf retreats. \u201cI have a sort of amnesia,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way you live with it is you forget how bad the pain was. I think it\u2019s your body\u2019s learned response. Otherwise you would not be able to carry on. You would never lie down to sleep, knowing what was coming.\u201d \u201cI try to tell her to rest, and she\u2019s like: \u2018No, I have a PhD to do!\u2019\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI definitely would have given up by now.\u201d He has assumed the role of caretaker, including making sure she eats properly. \u201cShe will try to work all hours of the day, all the time,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI think she lived off toast before I met her \u2013 toast and beer.\u201d The relentless pace takes a toll. Last year, Morton-Hayward experienced severe abdominal pains, which she ignored. But it turned out to be an ovarian abscess, and the infection spread throughout her body, leading to sepsis. She spent two weeks in hospital and underwent blood and iron transfusions. \u201cOn the third day, this big team came rushing into the ward, super panicked,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy haemoglobin numbers were so low that they expected to see somebody in cardiac arrest.\u201d In April, shortly after the publication of her paper, Morton-Hayward travelled to a conference in New Orleans to give a presentation and enjoy a holiday with Thomas. By the end of the trip, she had developed a cough. During the flight home her breathing weakened. On landing, she headed straight to A&amp;E, where she discovered she had pneumonia. She went back into hospital. \u201cI\u2019m really sick of being sick,\u201d she said. Even as her brain and body conspired against her, Morton-Hayward pushed forward. Nobody better understands the preciousness of time, the urgency, than someone one with a grave illness who has come close to death. * * * One morning a few weeks after her bout with pneumonia, Morton-Hayward picked up her picnic cooler and set out in pursuit of more specimens. She made the long drive from Oxford to Belgium in stormy weather. As usual, her attacks came overnight, this time as she was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Ghent. Over breakfast the next day, she pulled out her phone and glanced at a ghoulish photo of a brain from a medieval churchyard. Stowing the cooler in the back of the car, she drove through the Belgian countryside. Long barges ploughed through canals and giant freighters stacked with shipping containers loomed over the quays. Lowlands were a boom not only for shipping: waterlogged soils also preserved brains and, today, a cheerful reaper had come to harvest them. On these plains, one did not have to dig deep to find human remains. Hundreds of thousands died here in the first world war, as immortalised in a famous poem by John McCrae: \u201cIn Flanders fields the poppies blow / Between the crosses, row on row.\u201d After a short drive, Morton-Hayward arrived at the offices of an archaeological firm, BAAC. Nandy Dolman, an archaeologist, led Morton-Hayward into a cavernous warehouse of the dead. Tall shelves were stacked with cardboard boxes containing thousands of skeletons dating back to the medieval period. Since 2020, the firm had been exhuming the cemetery of St Martin\u2019s Church, a famous landmark in Ypres dating back to the 13th century. To make way for an urban construction project, about 1,300 skeletons had been removed, including scores with preserved cerebral matter. On a previous visit Morton-Hayward had collected 55 brains, and had returned for the final 37, packed in plastic bags labelled Monster \u2013 which is Dutch for \u201csample\u201d. In a conference room upstairs, Dolman gave a detailed presentation about the graves of Flemish people who might have lived during the era depicted by the painters Pieter Bruegel the Elder and his namesake son. She believes the preserved brains span hundreds of years, as far back as the 12th century. Skeletons had been documented with geolocation, photographs and data including sex, approximate age and whether the skulls contained brains. Dolman showed photos of bones with the distinctive blue and red stains \u2013 indications of iron, the metal suspected of catalysing brain preservation. \u201cThe documentation, the metadata \u2013 this is tip-top,\u201d Morton-Hayward said. Then Dolman revealed a surprise: the newly found brains included those of 20 children. Morton-Hayward opened her mouth and eyes wide in astonishment. Until then, she had only a single juvenile in her collection of 600 preserved brains. Could children too have suffered extreme neurological stress and accelerated brain ageing? Perhaps during a famine? Or was another mechanism at work? As countless scientists have discovered, every advance only generates more questions. \u201cI\u2019ll write up these notes tomorrow and go through my monsters,\u201d she told her colleague just before bidding farewell. She had a long journey ahead across three countries, hoping to arrive home before the werewolf returned. In Flanders fields, the grasses blew beside the parking lot as Morton-Hayward returned to the car carrying the remains of three dozen souls who, centuries before, watched sunsets glow over these plains. Why had they persisted so long? Were everlasting brains the rewards for their agonies? Once silent in the grave, now they would speak again, thanks to someone who had also, against the odds, endured. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on X at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Radio 2\u2019s Jo Whiley will also be curating a dog-themed playlist for the garden, which will be playing throughout the show from the summerhouse. The brick paths will be inscribed with the names of dogs belonging to Radio 2 presenters and RHS ambassadors, as well as Monty\u2019s dog Ned. The garden will be relocated after the show to Battersea Dogs and Cats home, of which Queen Camilla is the patron, so her adopted Jack Russell Terriers, Beth and Bluebell, will also feature on the path. Don said: \u201cThis is an irresistible opportunity to join with the RHS and Radio 2 to share my love of gardens and dogs at the world\u2019s greatest horticultural event. Along with the superb team headed by Jamie Butterworth, we shall be making a garden that is inspired by Longmeadow and my own dogs but above all a celebration of the way that so many of us share our gardens with our canine companions.\u201d A tribute to Nigel, who died in 2020, is planted in Don\u2019s Herefordshire garden: Don created a topiary golden retriever to watch over him when he gardens, just as Nigel did. He has previously said he likes dogs so much because they are \u201cnot humans\u201d.",

But Goodbye Jimmy Dean was actually by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/boyswonderofficial/\">Boys Wonder</a>, a visionary band whose star rose and fell between 1986 and 1988. They were about eight years ahead of their time, and in retrospect, their chronically awkward fit with their era was probably always going to be their undoing. But while they lasted, they were great. In 1987, I saw them performing on the Channel 4 comedy show Saturday Live, swaggeringly delivering another three-minute manifesto titled Shine on Me. I was smitten, but given their large-scale blanking by the music press (and the fact that the world wide web had yet to be invented), I was left wondering what on earth had happened to them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He looked like something out of black-and-white era Doctor Who.

Goodbye Jimmy Dean was the third, put out before the loss of key members and an ill-advised detour into more dance-influenced music. Even at the band\u2019s peak, journalists were largely indifferent or hostile, and their songs were barely played on the radio. As their singer Ben Addison now puts it: \u201cWe were banging our heads against a wall. And the wall won.\u201d</p> <p>Now their prescience might finally be acknowledged. The band\u2019s quintessential five-piece lineup have just performed their first gig in 35 years, with another to follow. At the same time, some of their original stage outfits feature in <a href=\"https://fashiontextilemuseum.org/exhibitionsdisplays/outlaws/\">Outlaws</a>, a new exhibition centred on \u201cfashion renegades of 80s London\u201d at the capital\u2019s Fashion and Textile Museum. But the main event is a brilliant new Boys Wonder anthology titled Question Everything, most of which has never been heard before.</p> <p>In the course of a fascinating two-hour Zoom call, Addison \u2013 who is now a father of two, resident in Dusseldorf \u2013 tells me the band\u2019s story. He and his twin brother, Scott, were art-school alumni from south-east London, who cut their musical teeth as the drummer and bassist with a quartet called <a href=\"http://www.brigandage.com/\">Brigandage</a> (\u201cthe Sex Pistols with a female singer,\u201d he says), in the vanguard of a short-lived genre known as Positive Punk. Once that project had come to grief, they befriended guitarist Graham Jones, who was about to exit the wreckage of early 1980s pop sensations Haircut 100. He and the Addisons shared a vision of the best punk rock being mixed with a dazzling array of other influences.</p> <p>Jones, who speaks to me from his home in Cornwall, recalls daily trips to the Addisons\u2019 flat, where the three of them would meticulously record songs using a four-track Portastudio. \u201cWhile Scott was doing his overdubs,\u201d he says, \u201cBen would be sitting over in the corner with a pad and paper and he\u2019d be drawing outfits. Our girlfriends were going to fashion college, so some of them could create the items of clothing that Ben was drawing. There was more going on than just the music: this whole creative process was happening behind the scenes.\u201d</p> <p>They soaked up as much of their favourite music \u2013 and its iconography \u2013 as they could. \u201cWe would sit down together and watch the Who do <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiSKu7SbGNQ\">My Generation</a> on [1960\u2019s US TV staple] The Smothers Brothers show,\u201d says Addison. \u201cThe [Pistols\u2019] God Save the Queen video. Untold Bowie stuff. Roxy, especially with the shoulder pads and Brian Eno\u2019s feathers. Tom Jones when he was at his most gyratable, as it were. And pre-fat Elvis.\u201d</p>    <p>There was an early plan to call the band Batman &amp; Robin, but the expectation of copyright problems led them to put an \u2018s\u2019 on the latter character\u2019s \u201cBoy Wonder\u201d tagline, and the resulting name stuck. A visual breakthrough came with the Addisons\u2019 bowl-contoured haircuts, which defied the 80s\u2019 tyranny of quiffs. \u201cA good friend of ours called Andrew McLaughlin was a rising star within Vidal Sassoon,\u201d says Addison. \u201cHe turned up one night at the Greenwich theatre bar, which was one of our favourite hangouts, with this bleached, completely severe fringe, like Henry V. He looked like something out of black and white Doctor Who. I said, \u2018Fucking hell, Andrew \u2013 that is the bomb. This is what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019\u201d Ben combined his new barnet with eyebrows almost comically thickened with an eye-pencil, and instantly had his signature look.</p> <p>\u201cIt just felt just so exciting, to be doing something that no one else was doing,\u201d says Jones.

To coin the cliche, I think we really were more of a tax write-off than anything else.\u201d So it was that their time as a major-label act abruptly came to a close; a short spell with the Rough Trade label proved no more successful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m way older now.

Re-turn, which was mandated by the Irish government, to implement the scheme as part of a bid to meet EU 90% recycling targets, said that in the eight months since February, 630m containers have been deposited at reverse vending machines up and down the country. In what is the biggest behavioural shift since the plastic bag tax was introduced in 2001, returns have rocketed from 2m a month to 110m a month, according to the latest figures. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a pretty easy way of people feeling good about themselves, because a lot of people do want to do recycling, to do the right thing for the planet,\u201d said Ciaran Foley, chief executive of Re-turn, the company tasked with implementing and running the scheme. The scheme has also reduced litter on streets, raised money for charity and even helped homeless people and children raise small quantities of cash. Similar schemes have stalled several times in the UK and previously been canned in Ireland, but they exist in many EU member states including Germany where legislation that took effect in 2006 means consumers are able to return both refillable bottles and single-use cans. Ciava Dunning, a train driver on the Dublin Westport line, says she noticed people carry their rubbish off the train now, whereas before they left it behind, as they could now collect \u20ac0.15 (12p) per can and \u20ac0.25 per plastic bottle.

For a country with a population of just over 5 million, a return rate of more than 110m a month appears to be the seal of success. But with an estimated 1.7bn cans and plastic bottles put on the market every year, Ireland has some way to go. As an EU member state, Ireland must increase that to 77% next year and 90% by 2029, all part of the bloc-wide effort to boost the circular economy. A PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottle can be recycled seven times, while cans can be recycled indefinitely. For other countries such as the UK, which hope to launch its own scheme in 2026, Foley says the challenges should not be underestimated. \u201cWhen we went live, we got lots of resistance from the public,\u201d he says. \u201cSocial media can be brutal.

On Tuesday, the charity South West Heritage Trust announced it had acquired the coins for the nation thanks to major funding including from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund. From 26 November, the hoard will go on display at the British Museum in London and will then be shown across the UK, including Bath, not far from the spot it was found, before finding a permanent home at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.

      "body": "<p>Louise Haigh, like many transport secretaries before her, wants to know what the hell has gone wrong at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/hs2\">HS2</a>, why the costs jump every time the numbers are added up, and whether anything can be done to get a financial grip on the project. \u201cI have seen up close the scale of failure in project delivery \u2013 and it\u2019s dire,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/20/ministers-to-oversee-dire-hs2-as-true-cost-remains-uncertain\">she says</a>.</p> <p>Nobody would argue with that assessment. The latest estimate for the first stage of the project is a colossal \u00a360bn to \u00a365bn in today\u2019s money, and it\u2019s odds-on that a few more billion will come at the next count. So it is reasonable for a new government, especially one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/08/building-hs2-to-euston-and-crewe-could-pay-for-itself-analysis-finds\">contemplating reinstating the section to Crewe</a>, albeit in slimmed-down form, to want to know what happened. Yet another independent review of HS2 \u2013 this one by James Stewart, former chair of infrastructure at KPMG \u2013 is justified.</p> <p>But the intriguing part in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/transport-secretary-announces-urgent-action-to-get-a-grip-on-spiralling-hs2-costs\">Haigh\u2019s announcement</a> was her separate review into the \u201cincentives\u201d of contractors, which, we\u2019re told, \u201ccould lead to some contracts being renegotiated or amended\u201d. That\u2019s getting to the nub of the matter because the most significant chunk of HS2\u2019s cost over-runs relates to the decision, circa 2018, to award cost-plus contracts \u2013 where the contractor is paid a percentage of the total value of the work, whatever that value ends up being \u2013 on the line from Old Oak Common to Birmingham Curzon Street.

      "bodyText": "Louise Haigh, like many transport secretaries before her, wants to know what the hell has gone wrong at HS2, why the costs jump every time the numbers are added up, and whether anything can be done to get a financial grip on the project. \u201cI have seen up close the scale of failure in project delivery \u2013 and it\u2019s dire,\u201d she says. Nobody would argue with that assessment. The latest estimate for the first stage of the project is a colossal \u00a360bn to \u00a365bn in today\u2019s money, and it\u2019s odds-on that a few more billion will come at the next count. So it is reasonable for a new government, especially one contemplating reinstating the section to Crewe, albeit in slimmed-down form, to want to know what happened. Yet another independent review of HS2 \u2013 this one by James Stewart, former chair of infrastructure at KPMG \u2013 is justified. But the intriguing part in Haigh\u2019s announcement was her separate review into the \u201cincentives\u201d of contractors, which, we\u2019re told, \u201ccould lead to some contracts being renegotiated or amended\u201d. That\u2019s getting to the nub of the matter because the most significant chunk of HS2\u2019s cost over-runs relates to the decision, circa 2018, to award cost-plus contracts \u2013 where the contractor is paid a percentage of the total value of the work, whatever that value ends up being \u2013 on the line from Old Oak Common to Birmingham Curzon Street.

Why were such one-sided contracts ever written? Well, at the start of 2018, Carillion, a giant of the contracting sector, had gone bust and ministers feared big companies wouldn\u2019t bid for HS2 work if they were on the hook for a normal level of cost over-runs. Put another way, the contractors had an opportunity to run rings around naive ministers and their arm\u2019s-length body, and they seized it. The size of these contracts, a report from the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) said in September, meant there was \u201can imbalance of power\u201d between contractors and HS2 Ltd.

Odebrecht, now known as Novonor, was at the centre of Latin America\u2019s largest graft scandal, after admitting in 2016 that it had bribed officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts. During the year-long trial, Toledo denied the money-laundering and collusion charges. On Monday he frequently smirked, and at times laughed, particularly when the judge mentioned multimillion-dollar sums central to the case as well as when she struggled to read transcripts and other evidence in the case. However last week he asked the court with a broken voice and the palms of his hands together to let him return home citing his age, cancer and heart problems. \u201cPlease let me heal or die at home,\u201d he said. Judge In\u00e9s Rojas said Toledo\u2019s victims were Peruvians who \u201ctrusted\u201d him as their president. Rojas explained that in that role, Toledo was \u201cin charge of managing public finances\u201d and responsible for \u201cprotecting and ensuring the correct\u201d use of resources. Instead, she said, he \u201cdefrauded the state.\u201d The sentence was announced in a room set up in a small Lima prison where Toledo has been detained since last year and which was built specifically to house former Peruvian presidents. Former president Alberto Fujimori, who died in September, served time there and ex-president Pedro Castillo is also being held there as he faces allegations of \u201crebellion\u201d after trying to dissolve Congress in 2022. Two other ex-presidents, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Ollanta Humala, are also being investigated in the Odebrecht case. Toledo, who famously shined shoes as a child, was arrested in the US in 2019 after officials in Peru requested his extradition. Prosecutors relied on testimony from former Odebrecht executive Jorge Barata as well as Toledo\u2019s ex-collaborator Josef Maiman, who said Toledo received bribes. The former president signed the contract with Odebrecht for the construction of the road, though the building took place over two subsequent administrations.

The open association with figures like Wallnau, who has written that the US is headed toward civil war and has accused Harris of practicing \u201cwitchcraft\u201d, could be a gamble, given the strong influence such figures wield among their followers \u2013 and the outrage they stoke among the uninitiated.",

De Bruyn told Guardian Australia he was approached by the ACU in November offering him the honorary doctorate and inviting him to give the graduation address, which he accepted, providing his speech a week in advance. \u201cThey knew what I was going to say, as to their attitude you\u2019d have to ask them,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to offend anybody but you can\u2019t say \u2018I\u2019m sensitive\u2019 and therefore you are not allowed to talk about some issue \u2013 it shuts down public debate.\u201d He said the topics he spanned were \u201cperfectly logical\u201d given he was being honoured by a Catholic university on his services to the Catholic church, describing abortion as a \u201ccatastrophic issue\u201d that needed to be discussed. His speech also touched on LGBTQ+ rights. Last year, the ACU faced controversy for ordering librarians to remove the public display of rainbow flags across campuses. De Bruyn told graduates marriage between man and a woman was \u201cinstituted by God at the origin of humanity in the Garden of Eden\u201d and \u201cevery society on Earth at all times\u201d had recognised marriage as being between opposite sexes. The head of the ACU\u2019s National Tertiary Education Union branch, Yaegan Doran, said the speech brought \u201cshame on the union movement\u201d and the university. \u201cAbortion rights are fundamental to women\u2019s rights,\u201d he said. \u201cQueer rights are not up for negotiation. Management\u2019s choice to give him an honorary doctorate brings shame on the university.\u201d One attendee, Laura, who did not want to use her surname, was at the graduation ceremony to celebrate her sister and walked out alongside other guests. She described the speech as \u201chateful\u201d and \u201cvitriolic\u201d. \u201cWhat should have been a day of pride for my sister, who is now a qualified primary school teacher, has been soured by this choice made by the ACU senate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely shameful and disgusting.\u201d De Bruyn was a former member of the Labor party national executive during his time as a union leader. The SDA was a major obstacle to the ALP legalising same-sex marriage before 2017. He was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia in the Queen\u2019s birthday honours list in 2022. A former crisis and risk communication lecturer at ACU, Tracie Winch, wrote on X that graduates who attended the event should be issued a refund and an apology. \u201cWithdraw the honorary doctorate. Is this what you stand for?\u201d she wrote. \u201cUniversity senate should be sacked.\u201d In a statement, an ACU spokesman said it offered the honorary degree to De Bruyn \u201cin recognition of his dedication to the rights of workers, educational advancement and improving social welfare\u201d. \u201cMr De Bruyn\u2019s remarks at the ceremony were delivered in a personal capacity. While his views may not be shared by many of our staff and students, as a university we encourage the respectful exchange of ideas that represent the wide spectrum of our diverse community.\u201d",

\u201cfull responsibility\u201d in case of a retaliatory attack by Israel on the Islamic Republic, after US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> indicated he was aware of Israeli plans to do so.</p> \n  <p><strong>Amir Saeid Iravani</strong>, Iran\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, called Biden\u2019s remarks \u201cprofoundly alarming and provocative\u201d in a letter addressed to UN chief <strong>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres</strong> and the Swiss presidency of the UN security council, according to AFP.</p> \n  <p>The US president responded \u201cyes and yes\u201d when asked Friday by a reporter if he had \u201ca good understanding right now\u201d of how and when Israel would respond to Iran\u2019s missile barrage on 1 October.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe United States will bear full responsibility for its role in instigating, inciting and enabling any acts of aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2026 as well as for the catastrophic consequences on regional and international peace and security,\u201d Iran\u2019s U.N. mission said in a letter to the UN security council.</p> \n  <p>Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders belonging to Hamas and Hezbollah, and an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general.</p> \n  <p>US ally Israel, at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, vowed revenge against Iran for the strikes.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis inflammatory statement (of Biden) is deeply concerning, as it indicates the United States\u2019 tacit approval and explicit support for Israel\u2019s unlawful military aggression against Iran,\u201d Iravani wrote in the letter.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTherefore, the United States will bear full responsibility for its role in instigating, inciting and enabling any acts of aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>According to the Washington Post, Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> has told Biden that he intends to strike Iran\u2019s military sites, and

The Fatwa is based on Islamic teaching, as much as foreign policy.</p> \n  <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/20/leaked-documents-allege-israel-plans-attack-iran\">the leak of the US classified documents over the weekend</a> setting out how Iran might be attacked is widely seen in Iran either as an effort inside the Biden administration to warn Israel off from mounting such a large attack on Iran, or else an attempt to persuade Iran to back down. The mood in Tehran is that an attack is imminent, and trust in US assurances that Iran\u2019s nuclear sites will be spared is low. Baqaei said Iran\u2019s planned response to any Israeli attack was already in place.</p> \n  <p>The recent call to abandon the Fatwa was originally led by an Iranian MP Mohammad Reza Sabaghiani who said \u201cto preserve the deterrent capability and ensure national security, the ability to develop nuclear weapons is necessary. While having nuclear weapons is possible for Israel, Iran must pursue nuclear weapons for self-defense\u201d.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, a second MP, Fathollah Tousi, who is a member of the parliament\u2019s economic commission, said Iran had the ability to make a bomb, but the decision rested with the Supreme Leader.</p> \n  <p>It has also been noticed in Iran that their leaked documents implicitly assume that Israel has a nuclear weapon, something that had been widely assumed in Tehran.</p> \n  <p>The Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was continuing with his regional tour visiting Bahrain and Kuwait as part of his effort to form a united front against Israel and explain Iran\u2019s support for the so-called axis of resistance in Lebanon and Gaza.</p> \n  <p>He has also been seeking assurances that Gulf States will not cooperate in any Israeli attack on Iran by allowing its airspace to be used. The foreign ministry said: \u201cWe are sure that the countries of the region, understanding the sensitivity of the region and the conditions, will not allow their space to be used to attack an Islamic country.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-21T14:33:46.377Z\">at 3.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6716630d8f08ec51ad9b2075\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-21T14:21:01.876Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Israeli military said air force helicopters and fighter jets intercepted five drones in the Mediterranean Sea before they crossed into the country.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/idfonline/status/1848361860451438944\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"iw\" dir=\"rtl\">\u05de\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d5\u05de\u05d8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d8\u05d5 \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d4 \u05db\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d8\u05d9\u05e1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05de\u05e8\u05d7\u05d1 \u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05df.<br>\u05db\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d8\u05d9\u05e1 \u05d4\u05d1\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d8\u05e8\u05dd \u05d7\u05e6\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e9\u05d8\u05d7 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5.<br><br>\u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3, \u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05d2\u05e9 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05d7\u05e9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d8\u05d7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d6\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d1\u05f4\u05d2</p>\u2014 \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc (@idfonline) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/idfonline/status/1848361860451438944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 21, 2024</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-21T14:34:19.676Z\">at 3.34pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-67165f198f08ec51ad9b2046\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-21T14:07:04.078Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Israel\u2019s airport authority briefly halted the takeoff and landing of flights at the country\u2019s main airport \u2013 <strong>Ben Gurion </strong>\u2013 this afternoon.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn coordination with the security system, landings and takeoffs at the airport were stopped,\u201d the airport authority said in a statement earlier, without elaborating further.

      "bodyText": "This blog is now closed. You can read our latest report on Israel\u2019s strikes on Lebanon here and all our coverage from the region here. Further to our earlier post here, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, is reporting that 10 civilians were killed and 30 others injured in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. At least 10 civilians were killed and 30 others were injured today as a result of the Israeli occupation artillery shelling of Jabalia Preparatory School, which houses displaced people in Jabalia camp, north of the Gaza Strip. Local sources said that medical teams recovered the bodies of at least 10 slain Palestinians and a number of wounded in Israeli artillery shelling of Jabalia Preparatory School in the Al-Fawqa area schools square, which is a Unrwa shelter for displaced people in Jabalia camp, north of the Gaza Strip. Medical sources indicated that 57 citizens were killed in the occupation raids on the Gaza Strip since dawn today, 44 of them in the north of the Strip. The UN warned Monday that almost no aid is entering the besieged Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped, CNN reports. \u201cAlmost no humanitarian aid is getting into (the) Jabalia refugee camp and telecommunications are severely disrupted amid ongoing air strikes, shelling and fighting across north Gaza, as the violence displaces more and more people,\u201d Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, said at a briefing. Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalia to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing. He also said a request by OCHA Monday to distribute food, medicine and fuel in the Jabalia camp was denied. Only four out of 66 planned humanitarian missions from southern to northern Gaza had been facilitated by Israeli authorities since the start of October, Haq added. \u201cWe reiterate once again that these delays are likely costing lives,\u201d he said. COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages the flow of aid into the strip, insists that supplies are reaching Gaza. In a post on X on Monday, it said that that in the past 24 hours, 47 humanitarian aid trucks had been transferred to northern Gaza. For comparison, CNN said, the UN previously reported that an average 500 trucks entered the strip a day in the months before 7 October 2023. Israel\u2019s requirements for the indemnification needed to allow Israeli banks to continue conducting transactions with Palestinian banks have been met by the Palestinian authorities, Reuters reports, citing an unnamed source. Technical experts argue that should warrant an extension of a current indemnification \u2013 set to lapse at the end of the month \u2013 for at least a year to avert an economic crisis in the West Bank, the source said. US deputy treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo, who last month warned Israel that allowing the banking relationships to lapse would put its own security at risk, spoke on Monday with Palestinian Authority prime minister Mohammad Mustafa (see earlier post here). A bit more (see earlier post here) on US secretary of state Antony Blinken\u2019s trip to the Middle East to push for a Gaza ceasefire. Blinken, who is expected in Israel on Tuesday, will visit Jordan on Wednesday and discuss humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip with the Jordanians, AFP reports, citing an official on the top US diplomat\u2019s plane. The official said that Blinken, who is expected to travel in the region through Friday, would be speaking throughout his trip on bridging gaps on reaching a ceasefire in the year-old Gaza war. Blinken will also discuss initial outlines of a post-conflict governance plan in Gaza, the official said. Blinken also plans to speak to Israel about its expected military strike on Iran and discourage any move that massively increases regional conflict, the official said. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has voiced hope for progress on an elusive ceasefire, two weeks before US elections, after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, described by US officials as intransigent in his demands. Blinken\u2019s other stops this trip are likely to include Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, officials say. Iran on Monday warned the United States would bear \u201cfull responsibility\u201d in case of a retaliatory attack by Israel on the Islamic Republic, after US president Joe Biden indicated he was aware of Israeli plans to do so. Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, called Biden\u2019s remarks \u201cprofoundly alarming and provocative\u201d in a letter addressed to UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and the Swiss presidency of the UN security council, according to AFP. The US president responded \u201cyes and yes\u201d when asked Friday by a reporter if he had \u201ca good understanding right now\u201d of how and when Israel would respond to Iran\u2019s missile barrage on 1 October. \u201cThe United States will bear full responsibility for its role in instigating, inciting and enabling any acts of aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2026 as well as for the catastrophic consequences on regional and international peace and security,\u201d Iran\u2019s U.N. mission said in a letter to the UN security council. Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders belonging to Hamas and Hezbollah, and an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. US ally Israel, at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, vowed revenge against Iran for the strikes. \u201cThis inflammatory statement (of Biden) is deeply concerning, as it indicates the United States\u2019 tacit approval and explicit support for Israel\u2019s unlawful military aggression against Iran,\u201d Iravani wrote in the letter. \u201cTherefore, the United States will bear full responsibility for its role in instigating, inciting and enabling any acts of aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,\u201d he said. According to the Washington Post, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Biden that he intends to strike Iran\u2019s military sites, and not to target nuclear or oil infrastructure. Lebanese state-run media reported 13 strikes on Monday evening on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, a main Hezbollah bastion, AFP reports, in one of the most intense nights of Israeli attacks in weeks. While most districts of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs had been emptied for almost a month, the densely packed residential area of Ouzai was still filled with people because it had never been targeted before. Lebanon\u2019s National news agency reported at least three Israeli strikes on the Ouzai district. Hezbollah-affiliated rescuers told AFP they were looking for survivors amid the devastation in Ouzai, adding that the evacuation alert, then the strike, caused \u201cpanic among residents\u201d who \u201cstarted to run in the streets\u201d. \u201cThey did not leave any room for people to escape. The strike came closely after the warning,\u201d one said. AFPTV footage showed plumes of smoke rising from Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, with AFP correspondents also hearing several loud bangs before the strikes. The footage also showed two strikes that caused a huge fire, with black smoke surrounding dissipating orange flames. Deputy US treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo on Monday spoke with Palestinian Authority prime minister Mohammad Mustafa and they discussed security and economic stability in the West Bank, the Treasury department said. Adeyemo and Mustafa also discussed the Palestinian Authority\u2019s efforts to improve its anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regime, the department said. It added that Adeyemo \u201cstressed the importance of preventing terrorists and violent extremists\u201d from raising, using, and moving funds in the West Bank. The full readout from Treasury: Today, U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo spoke with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa. They discussed security and economic stability in the West Bank as well as the Palestinian Authority\u2019s efforts to improve its anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo stressed the importance of preventing terrorists and violent extremists from raising, using, and moving funds in the West Bank. He noted the Palestinian Authority\u2019s progress on strengthening its CFT regime to further support these relationships, including by completing key milestones related to the assessment of AML/CFT risks within its jurisdiction and bolstering effective compliance with international standards. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo commended the Palestinian Authority for completing a risk assessment of their financial system, as well as scheduling a MENAFATF evaluation of their banking system. These are both critical steps for ensuring financial linkages between the Palestinian territories and the international financial system continue. They discussed the importance of the correspondent banking relationships between Israeli and Palestinian banks to the security and economic stability of the region. A Lebanese security official has said that the country\u2019s national airline had to switch landing strips on Monday after Israeli strikes near Beirut\u2019s only international airport hit close to the main runway, AFP reports. \u201cMiddle East Airlines switched the runway it was using because the main runway is close to the site of the Ouzai strike,\u201d the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. A lot of news continues to unfold in Beirut, Lebanon, and in northern Gaza. We\u2019ll keep you up with developments as reliable information emerges. It\u2019s around 1am on Tuesday in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City. The Guardian\u2019s New York team is handing over to our colleagues in Australia now. Here\u2019s where things stand: At least four were killed, including a child, and 24 were injured when one of the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut on Monday night hit just in front of the entrance of the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the largest public hospital in Lebanon. Israel also accused Hezbollah of operating under Sahel hospital, not that far away, also in the southern suburbs of the capital. That hospital was being evacuated and has not been hit. The heads of the United Nations World Food Programme and UN children\u2019s agency Unicef, Catherine Russell and Cindy McCain, have privately appealed to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help \u201calleviating the suffering of countless civilians\u201d in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, according to a new letter. Fadi Alame, the director of the Sahel hospital in the southern suburbs of Beirut, said an evacuation was getting underway and also denied that the hospital is cover for Hezbollah, despite Israeli accusations of such. Israel said the building covers a Hezbollah bunker that was used to shield the assassinated head of the militant group, Hassan Nasrallah, and cash for the group. Joe Biden\u2019s US administration remains \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel\u2019s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the White House has said. There is no indication that additional documents have been compromised and US officials have been in communication with Israeli counterparts about the leak, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley in the morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan. Lebanese state media reported further airstrikes on southern Lebanon in the last few hours, with reports of people being killed in the attacks and residential neighbourhoods being targeted by the Israeli military. There were reports that at least 29 Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. Israel has been accused of preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies, including water, food and medicine for people under siege. The US says it is intensifying diplomatic efforts to get ceasefires between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was also set to depart for a four-day trip to Israel and other countries in the Middle East on Monday. Israeli authorities are still preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies including medicine and food for people under siege, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, said. Up to 1,000 women and children needing medical care will shortly be evacuated from Gaza to Europe, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s Europe branch said. Israel, which is besieging the war-devastated Palestinian territory, \u201cis committed to 1,000 more medical evacuations within the next months to the European Union,\u201d Hans Kluge said, adding the evacuations would be facilitated by the WHO \u2013 the United Nations health agency \u2013 and the European countries involved. In northern Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent Society has posted an account from Ahmad Abu Al-Foul, a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), about what it describes as \u201cthe challenges of working in an area under intense Israeli occupation, targeting for the seventeenth consecutive day.\u201d The volunteer, in the interpreted English language captions, talks of the dangers he and colleagues face as they continue working to save lives. He described the huge pressure with pleas for help coming in all the time amid a shortage of medical supplies and fuel. \u201cWe receive dozens of pleas every day and every hour\u201d he said, from places where Palestinian civilians are getting caught up in active combat by the Israeli military\u2019s counteroffensive against Hamas. \u201cThe hospitals are finding it difficult to handle the large number of casualties that arrive every minute,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite this we continue to do our humanitarian work in northern Gaza.\u201d Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Health has condemned what it said was \u201cattacks on two of Lebanon\u2019s largest hospitals\u201d on Monday and was part of Israel\u2019s \u201cdaily targeting of the Lebanese health sector.\u201d Israel has killed at least 115 healthcare workers and emergency responders since fighting started between Hezbollah and Israel a year prior. It was the second night in a row that Beirut was heavily bombed, with Israel carrying out more than 15 airstrikes on Hezbollah-linked banking institutions the night before. On Sunday night, Israel said that it would begin targeting a Hezbollah-affiliated bank, Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which provides interest free loans and banking services to hundreds of thousands of Lebanese \u2013 primarily Shia Muslims. It accused the bank of helping finance Hezbollah and said that its branches were used to store weapons. The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah\u2019s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel\u2019s targets from just the group\u2019s military wing. The institution had sanctions placed on it by the US in 2017 during the Trump administration for giving Hezbollah access to the international financial system, according to the US treasury. Amid Israeli airstrikes on Beirut on Monday night, one hit just in front of the entrance of the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the largest public hospital in Lebanon. At least four were killed, including a child, 24 were injured in the strike, and the hospital suffered \u201cmajor damage\u201d from the blast. Despite the strike, the hospital continued operating and is currently receiving the injured from the nearby strikes, a source at the hospital told the Guardian. The initial casualty count was expected to rise as first responders continued digging through the rubble for people. A picture of the building struck in front of Rafik Hariri hospital showed a man covered in blood lying lifeless in a bombed-out building. Fears proliferated that hospitals would be struck in the greater Beirut area after the Israeli military struck near Rafik Hariri hospital and published claims that Hezbollah was operating under Sahel hospital, also in the southern suburbs of the capital \u2013 a claim that echoed those made by Israel in Gaza. Further details from the two senior UN agency officials who have written to Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Unicef\u2019s Catherine Russell and the World Food Programme\u2019s Cindy McCain. They called on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to protect civilians and critical civilian services, Reuters reports, in its news scoop of seeing the letter that was sent. They wrote that the UN and aid groups: Need unequivocal security assurances to ensure a safe operating environment \u2026 the rules of engagement and their implementation in practice, in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and Lebanon, must reflect the IDF (Israel Defense Forces)\u2019s obligation and commitment to respect, protect, and facilitate humanitarian action,\u201d said Russell, a former senior aide to Joe Biden, and McCain, Biden\u2019s former ambassador to the UN agencies for food and agriculture in Rome. They urgently appealed for an effective humanitarian notification system that the Israeli military \u201cacknowledges and supports\u201d, citing the success of using area-specific pauses in fighting to allow for the polio vaccination of children in Gaza. We request this be applied consistently to facilitate humanitarian action at scale,\u201d they wrote. The United States said last week it was watching to ensure that its ally Israel\u2019s actions on the ground show it does not have a \u201cpolicy of starvation\u201d in the north of Gaza. Israel has said there is not a lack of aid in Gaza and accused Hamas of hijacking the humanitarian assistance, Reuters reports. Hamas has repeatedly denied Israeli allegations that it was stealing aid and says Israel is to blame for shortages. We call on your support, as Prime Minister, to ensure that the government of Israel upholds its obligations and commitments to enable effective emergency relief operations, and to protect the safety and security of our staff and the civilians they serve,\u201d Catherine Russell and Cindy McCain wrote in their letter to Benjamin Netanyahu. The UN appeal came two days before the US told Israel it must take steps within 30 days to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aid. The heads of the United Nations World Food Programme and UN children\u2019s agency Unicef have privately appealed to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help \u201calleviating the suffering of countless civilians\u201d in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, according to a new letter. The letter has been seen by Reuters today and the agency is reporting on that now, as it is previously unreported despite it being dated 11 October. Effective and meaningful humanitarian action is possible with your political will and commitment,\u201d wrote Unicef executive director Catherine Russell and WFP executive director Cindy McCain, the widow of former US Senator for Arizona, John McCain. Netanyahu\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the letter. The amount of aid entering Gaza has plummeted to its lowest level all year, according to UN data. In addition, a global hunger monitor has warned of a looming famine, and the UN has accused Israel of denying and impeding dozens of attempts this month to deliver aid, particularly to Gaza\u2019s north. More follows. An Israeli airstrike hit in front of the entrance of Rafic Hariri University hospital in south Beirut on Monday night, a spokesperson for the hospital told the Guardian. Rafik Hariri hospital is the largest public hospital in Lebanon and took over the treatment of some patients which had previously been evacuated from hospitals in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, due to intense Israeli bombing in the area. The bombing near the hospital occured as Israel carried out more airstrikes in Dahiyeh. The Israeli military had issued warnings for residents to move at least five hundred meters away from certain sites in Dahiyeh, including the pier in Ouzaieh, a part of Dahiyeh that still has people living in it. After the warnings were issued, residents of Ouzaieh began to flee the area. Just two hours earlier, the Israeli military said that Hezbollah was hiding hundreds of millions of dollars of cash under a hospital in Haret Hreik, a neighbourhood in Dahiyeh. The hospital was quickly evacuated after the accusation, an accusation the hospital director has since denied. News is firming up that an Israeli airstrike has hit near Beirut\u2019s Rafik Hariri University hospital in the southern suburbs late on Monday, Lebanon\u2019s largest public-sector hospital. Reuters is citing a hospital source, adding that it appeared the strike hit the hospital\u2019s parking lot. We await more details. A breaking news headline on Reuters citing a witness report: \u201cheavy strike heard near Beirut\u2019s souther suburbs\u201d. This as AFP reports that the Israeli army has issued a new evacuation call for residents in a southern Beirut suburb. These two notes may well connect and we\u2019ll update things soon. Other, unverified reports can be seen referring to the Haret Hreik area, between the center of Beirut and the main airport on the outskirts and wire pictures are emerging. A source at Rafik Hariri hospital has told Reuters that the latest Israeli strike has occurred nearby. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari is claiming that there is a bunker under the Sahel hospital in Beirut filled with cash and gold belonging to the coffers of Hezbollah. The hospital is currently being evacuated in case of Israeli air strikes, despite Israel\u2019s assertions that it will not attack the hospital. According to the estimates we have, there is at least half a billion dollars in dollar bills and gold stored in this bunker. This money could and still can be used to rebuild the state of Lebanon,\u201d Hagari said and AFP reports. Earlier today, Israeli military chief lieutenant general Herzi Halevi said more than two dozen targets belonging to Al-Qard al-Hassan \u2013 a financial firm linked to Hezbollah \u2013 were hit. The Israeli military is now saying it will not strike the Sahel hospital in southern Beirut, while emphasizing that it is intent on attacking monetary stashes it cites as being controlled by Lebanon-based Hezbollah. The Israeli army said today its forces were pummeling Hezbollah\u2019s financial arm, hitting more than two dozen targets including a bunker with tens of millions of dollars in cash and gold, Agence France-Presse reports. The strikes since Sunday night mark an expansion of Israel\u2019s campaign against the Iran-backed group after a year of cross-border exchanges that escalated in late September into a full-blown war. Israeli forces are now seeking to degrade the Shiite Muslim movement\u2019s ability to fund its operations. The Israeli air force carried out a series of precise strikes on these Hezbollah financial strongholds. One of our main targets last night was an underground vault with tens of millions of dollars in cash and gold. The money was being used to finance Hezbollah\u2019s attacks on Israel,\u201d Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing. Hagari then referenced a separate bunker also allegedly filled with cash and gold under a hospital in the capital Beirut, but said the vault had not been targeted yet by the Israeli military. Reports are coming in that a hospital in the southern suburbs of Beirut is being evacuated amid claims by Israel that the building covers a Hezbollah bunker that was used to shield the assassinated head of the militant group, Hassan Nasrallah, and cash for the group. Fadi Alame, the director of the Sahel hospital, has told Reuters about the evacuation getting underway and also denied that the hospital is cover for Hezbollah. At least two people were killed and three others injured today in an apparent guided missile attack on a car in the Mazzeh area of Damascus, Syrian state television said, quoting a military source, Reuters reports. The source attributed the attack to Israel. The attack occurred near the Eastern Roundabout, close to the Golden Mazzeh Hotel, a high-end establishment in the centre of Syria\u2019s capital, state media added. An Israeli military spokesman later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it killed the head of Hezbollah\u2019s money transfers unit. We will continue to act against Hezbollah in Syria and everywhere else,\u201d Israel\u2019s chief military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said in a televised statement. It looks like more detail may be emerging concerning the short report earlier that at least one person was killed today, probably at least two, in a \u201cguided missile attack\u201d on a car in the Mazzeh area of Damascus, reported a few hours ago by Syrian state television. The Israel Defense Forces reports via its spokesperson Daniel Hagari that Israel carried out an airstrike in Syria today, where it was targeting the leader of the financial organization funding Hezbollah, directing funds from Iran, the Times of Israel reports, referring to the financial firm Al-Qard al-Hassan. Hagari has not given a name but indicated the man is newly appointed. Reuters is now issuing some more detail and we\u2019ll bring an update on this news as soon as possible. The Israeli military has issued a touch of detail to information about the latest air strikes on Lebanon. The Israel army says it has hit about 300 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in the past day, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. The Israeli military said a little earlier today that it struck about 300 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon over the past 24 hours, in a widening air campaign now also targeting the group\u2019s financial operations. \u201cApproximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,\u201d the military said in a statement after military chief Herzi Halevi said around 30 targets related to Al-Qard al-Hassan, a financial firm linked to Iran-backed Hezbollah. Antony Blinken is departing today for a week-long trip to Israel and a number of Arab countries on a visit that also comes as Israel weighs retaliation against Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month. His other stops are likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, state department officials say, and the Associated Press reports. Since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October 2023, and the Israeli response, Blinken has traveled to the Middle East 10 other times seeking an end to the crisis. His previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities, but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past. His other stops this trip are likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, officials say. US secretary of state Antony Blinken is due to meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and president Isaac Herzog tomorrow. Tuesday\u2019s meetings are the first major items on the agenda as Blinken head for the region today in a fresh effort to kickstart ceasefire talks after Israel last week killed Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas. Secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages, and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people\u2026He will reaffirm the US commitment to work with partners across the region to de-escalate tensions and provide lasting stability,\u201d US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement, the Associated Press reports. As of last Friday, Blinken was in Germany on a visit with US president Joe Biden. The Biden administration remains \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel\u2019s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the White House has said. There is no indication that additional documents have been compromised and US officials have been in communication with Israeli counterparts about the leak, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. The following is from a story written by my colleagues Richard Luscombe and Dan Sabbagh who provide more detail on the leaks: The documents are attributed to the US Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency. They are written in a style similar to documents previously leaked from the Pentagon, using classifications familiar to the national security community. The first document has the title \u201cIsrael: air force continues preparations for strike on Iran and conducts a second large-force employment exercise\u201d and the second \u201cIsrael: defense forces continue key munitions preparations and covert UAV activity almost certainly for a strike on Iran\u201d. Both are dated 16 October and were first leaked a day later. Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley in the morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan. Lebanese state media reported further airstrikes on southern Lebanon in the last few hours, with reports of people being killed in the attacks and residential neighbourhoods being targeted by the Israeli military. There were reports that at least 29 Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. Israel has been accused of preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies, including water, food and medicine for people under siege. The US says it is intensifying diplomatic efforts to get ceasefires between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was also set to depart for a four-day trip to Israel and other countries in the Middle East on Monday. Israeli authorities are still preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies including medicine and food for people under siege, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, said. The US president\u2019s special envoy to Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, has held talks with Lebanese officials in Beirut today as diplomatic efforts to revive ceasefire talks in both Gaza and Lebanon continue. Hochstein said that it was \u201cnot enough\u201d for Israel and Hezbollah to commit to UN resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. It calls for southern Lebanon to be free of any troops or weapons other than those of the Lebanese state. The agreement states that Hezbollah and other armed militias must not be present past the Litani River, about 18 miles (30km) north of the border. Hochstein said that neither Hezbollah nor Israel had adequately implemented the resolution, and that while it would be the basis for the end to current war, the US was seeking to determine what more needed to be done to make sure it was implemented \u201cfairly, accurately and transparently\u201d. Speaking in Beirut, where he met Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, a close Hezbollah ally who has been engaging in diplomatic efforts, Hochstein said: We are working with government of Lebanon, the state of Lebanon, as well as the government of Israel to get to a formula that brings an end to this conflict once and for all.. The United States wants to end this conflict absolutely as soon as possible. That is what President Biden wants, that is what we all are working towards. At least one person was killed today in a \u201cguided missile attack\u201d on a car in the Mazzeh area of Damascus, according to Syrian state television. The circumstances surrounding the attack are unclear. We will give you more details on this as we get them. The Israeli military has apologised for an airstrike in southern Lebanon on Sunday that killed three Lebanese soldiers, the Associated Press reports. The military said it struck a truck that had entered an area where it had previously targeted a Hezbollah truck transporting a launcher and missiles. The military said its soldiers were not aware that the second truck belonged to the Lebanese army. Lebanon\u2019s army has historically stayed out of cross-border clashes between Israel and Hezbollah, an influential Shia Muslim political party and Iranian-backed armed group. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, is reporting that at least 29 Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip today. Wafa his this report, which we have not yet been able to independently verify: Medical sources reported that seven people were killed and wounded as a result of artillery shelling targeting displaced persons inside a school in the vicinity of Abu Rashid Pool in Jabalia camp\u2026 In addition, six people, including children, were killed and others were injured with varying degrees in an occupation raid that targeted a gathering of citizens while they were trying to fill drinking water in the town of Jabalia. In Jabalia camp, four civilians were killed in an airstrike launched by an occupation drone on a group of citizens near al-Yaman al-Saeed hospital. Jabalia, the largest of Gaza\u2019s eight historical refugee camps, has become the centrepiece of a renewed assault on northern Gaza by the Israeli military, who claim they are trying to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping. Tens of thousands of civilians are thought to be trapped in Jabalia, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating. There have been frequent reports of Palestinian civilians being killed in airstrikes there, which have caused widespread destruction, levelling civilian infrastructure. Wafa also reported today that nine \u201ccitizens\u201d were killed by Israeli bombing in Gaza City, while three other people were killed in a bombing that targeted Ghazi Al-Shawa school, which houses displaced people in the town of Beit Hanoun, in the northeast edge of the Strip. The entirety of northern Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders. The military has ordered residents to flee towards the so-called \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d of al-Mawasi, even though it has been targeted in deadly airstrikes and is severely overcrowded. The IDF said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d residents left Jabalia since this morning via organised routes. The Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli airstrike on the main eastern city of Baalbek killed six people, including a child, on Monday. The state-run National News Agency reported that all six were from the same family. According to the Lebanese health ministry, four people were killed and four others injured in an Israeli attack on al Kharayib in southern Lebanon. The NNA said four Israeli airstrikes hit the southern Lebanese town of Arabsalim, and that residential neighbourhoods were targeted. An NNA correspondent said Israeli warplanes targeted Khiam, a town in the Nabatieh area of southern Lebanon, with four raids conducted there. Patrick Wintour is diplomatic editor for the Guardian Iran has written to the UN nuclear watchdog to complain formally about a threatened Israeli attack on its nuclear sites, urging its officials to warn Israel that such an attack would not only be illegal but be a breach of UN resolutions. The International Atomic Energy Authority responsible for oversight of Iran\u2019s nuclear program has so far said little about the crisis, and its relations with Tehran have been strained recently. The warning outlined by the Iranian foreign ministry came as unnamed military sources stepped up their warnings that Iran would pursue building a nuclear weapons if what it insists is its civil nuclear program is attacked by Israel. The threat reported in Tasnim News, one of the sites closest to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Council, comes after 35 parliamentarians wrote to Iran\u2019s national security commission urging a re-examination of Iran\u2019s religious opposition to a bomb. But the foreign ministry spokesperson Ismail Baqaei, responding to media speculation, insisted that Iran has no plan to change the Fatwa against the use of nuclear weapons issued by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as far back as 2003. The Fatwa is based on Islamic teaching, as much as foreign policy. But the leak of the US classified documents over the weekend setting out how Iran might be attacked is widely seen in Iran either as an effort inside the Biden administration to warn Israel off from mounting such a large attack on Iran, or else an attempt to persuade Iran to back down. The mood in Tehran is that an attack is imminent, and trust in US assurances that Iran\u2019s nuclear sites will be spared is low. Baqaei said Iran\u2019s planned response to any Israeli attack was already in place. The recent call to abandon the Fatwa was originally led by an Iranian MP Mohammad Reza Sabaghiani who said \u201cto preserve the deterrent capability and ensure national security, the ability to develop nuclear weapons is necessary. While having nuclear weapons is possible for Israel, Iran must pursue nuclear weapons for self-defense\u201d. On Monday, a second MP, Fathollah Tousi, who is a member of the parliament\u2019s economic commission, said Iran had the ability to make a bomb, but the decision rested with the Supreme Leader. It has also been noticed in Iran that their leaked documents implicitly assume that Israel has a nuclear weapon, something that had been widely assumed in Tehran. The Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was continuing with his regional tour visiting Bahrain and Kuwait as part of his effort to form a united front against Israel and explain Iran\u2019s support for the so-called axis of resistance in Lebanon and Gaza. He has also been seeking assurances that Gulf States will not cooperate in any Israeli attack on Iran by allowing its airspace to be used. The foreign ministry said: \u201cWe are sure that the countries of the region, understanding the sensitivity of the region and the conditions, will not allow their space to be used to attack an Islamic country.\u201d The Israeli military said air force helicopters and fighter jets intercepted five drones in the Mediterranean Sea before they crossed into the country. Israel\u2019s airport authority briefly halted the takeoff and landing of flights at the country\u2019s main airport \u2013 Ben Gurion \u2013 this afternoon. \u201cIn coordination with the security system, landings and takeoffs at the airport were stopped,\u201d the airport authority said in a statement earlier, without elaborating further. Israeli media reported that a suspicious object had been seen near the airport, though this has not officially been confirmed. Services have now resumed at the airport. Israel\u2019s police and intelligence agencies claimed to have broken up a network of Israeli citizens who have been providing military intelligence useful for missile targeting to Iran and were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. The investigation claimed the network had been active for around two years, and according to reports in the Israeli the suspects are accused of photographing and collecting information on IDF bases and facilities, including the Kirya defence headquarters in Tel Aviv and the Nevatim and Ramat David airbases. The Nevatim base was targeted in both Iranian missile attacks this year, and Ramat David has been targeted by Hezbollah. According to a statement released on Monday, the seven Israeli citizens were arrested for gathering sensitive information on Israeli Defense Force bases and energy infrastructure. According to Haaretz, the suspects allegedly received hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash transfers from Russian tourists, as well as in crypto currencies. Three of the suspects were apprehended while photographing sensitive sites in southern Israel, and the police discovered dozens of documents in their possession. \u201cInvestigations revealed that over a period exceeding two years, the suspects executed multiple security missions under the direction of two Iranian intelligence agents known as \u2018Alkhan\u2019 and \u2018Orkhan\u2019. The network members were aware that the intelligence they provided compromised national security and could aid enemy missile attacks. \u201cThe network conducted extensive reconnaissance missions on IDF bases nationwide, focusing on air force and navy installations, ports, Iron Dome system locations, and energy infrastructure such as the Hadera power plant. These activities were financially compensated with payments totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, often facilitated through cryptocurrencies. \u201cThe operation involved photographing and documenting strategic sites, with the collected data being transferred to Iranian agents. Network members utilised advanced equipment procured specifically for these tasks under Iranian guidance.\u201d The arrested were also allegedly tasked with collecting intelligence on several Israeli citizens at the behest of Iranian agents. This included conducting surveillance on targeted individuals. Some members were apprehended while attempting to gather intelligence on an Israeli citizen residing near their location, with security assessments indicating potential Iranian plans to harm this individual. The latest arrests, which follow previous recent arrests of Israeli citizens for allegedly spying fpor Iran, suggests that the well-developed intelligence operations run by Israel targeting Iran, Gaza and Hezbollah have not been a one way street, with Iran and its proxies also running operations in Israel. Israel\u2019s security services have broken up a spy ring that was gathering information on behalf of Iranian intelligence in the latest attempt by Tehran to recruit Israelis for espionage, the Shin Bet and police said on Monday. Seven Israelis from Israel\u2019s north, including the port city of Haifa, were arrested after an investigation found they had gathered intelligence on Israeli military bases and energy and port infrastructure, a joint Shin Bet and police statement said. Israeli police said the security breach was among the most serious ever seen by Israel, Reuters reported. \u201cThe assessment is that the activity of the members of the ring has caused security damage to the security of the state,\u201d a senior source with the Shin Bet security service said. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. Israeli authorities are still preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies including medicine and food for people under siege, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa said on Monday. Hospitals have been hit and are without power while injured people are left without care, Philippe Lazzarini said on X. \u201c@Unrwa remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets. According to reports, people attempting to flee are getting killed, their bodies left on the street. Missions to rescue people from under the rubble are also being denied,\u201d he added. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the Unrwa statement, Reuters reported. Fabian Hinz, a Middle East expert and missile analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank, described the leak as \u201cquite damaging\u201d because it reveals previously secret Israeli weapons and capabilities. The air-launched Golden Horizon ballistic missiles have never been disclosed before and so key details, their range, payload and degree of manoeuvrability mid-flight are unknown, he said. Because they would be launched from a long way away \u2013 possibly from over Iraqi airspace \u2013 \u201cdefending against them is quite difficult,\u201d Hinz said, particularly for Iran whose air defence systems are not considered particularly robust. Israel was not known to possess a covert long-range drone, which the documents say is used for long-range reconnaissance. Its existing Heron and Hermes drones are thought to be vulnerable to Iranian detection, Hinz said. The US monitoring is described as sophisticated because a high degree of understanding is required to make sense of military movements as recorded by satellite imagery and other means. \u201cEverybody knows spying happens. But when you have a country, the closest ally of Israel, shown publicly to be spying [on its ally], that\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d Germany on Monday demanded Israel \u201cclarify every incident\u201d involving the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon (Unifil), including the reported destruction of a Unifil observation tower and fence. UN peacekeepers on Sunday said an Israeli \u201carmy bulldozer deliberately demolished\u201d a UN observation tower and fence in southern Lebanon. Israel launched ground and air attacks on Lebanon in September, saying it wanted to crush Hezbollah, a powerful political party and armed group. Berlin voiced \u201cgreat concern\u201d about the latest in a series of incidents reported by the Blue Helmet force, which have sparked international condemnation. The German government expects \u201cthe Israeli side to clarify every incident\u201d and to release \u201cthe results of the investigations into this specific incident\u201d, said foreign ministry spokesperson Kathrin Deschauer. \u201cThe safety of an operation mandated by the UN security council and its personnel must not be endangered,\u201d she added. Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz has said the country and its military have \u201cno intention\u201d of harming the peacekeepers. Unifil has accused Israel of attacking their members multiple times in recent weeks. Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley early on Monday morning, striking buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan. At least 10 airstrikes were carried out in the southern suburbs of Beirut, with an entire building collapsing and a jet of fire streaming into the air in the Chiyah neighbourhood of greater Beirut. A building close to Lebanon\u2019s only commercial airport was also struck, video footage showing a smoke plume billowing while a nearby airplane sat on the runway. \u201cThey struck empty buildings in residential neighbourhoods, and destroyed those surrounding neighbourhoods. These weren\u2019t military centres or weapons caches,\u201d Ma\u2019an Khalil, the mayor of Ghobeiry municipality in the southern suburbs of Beirut, said. Flames and smoke rise form an Israeli airstrike on Dahiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, on Sunday. Israel issued several warnings via X prior to the bombings, pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon, warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. Streets from the affected areas were soon choked with traffic as people fled in anticipation of Israeli bombing. Al-Qard Al-Hassan has branches across Lebanon, with 15 in greater Beirut alone. French president Emmanuel Macron told Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he sees the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as a chance for a possible new phase of negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza, Macron\u2019s office said on Monday. Macron, whose government has had increasingly tense public exchanges with Israel over the past few weeks, also reiterated previous calls for ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza and condemnations of Israeli army action towards UN forces in Lebanon. Macron also expressed solidarity with Netanyahu after a drone was launched towards the prime minister\u2019s home, the French president\u2019s office said. US envoy Amos Hochstein said on Monday that a UN security council resolution that ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict would be the basis of a new ceasefire, but would require more than just commitments from the warring parties. \u201cThe commitment that we have is to resolve this conflict based on (UN Resolution) 1701 that is what the solution is going to have to look like,\u201d Hochstein told reporters, adding that \u201cboth sides simply committing to 1701, is just not enough\u201d after years of weak implementation. Arab League secretary general Ahmed Aboul Gheit said on Monday in Beirut that the league\u2019s priority was to achieve an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon, and he called for Israel\u2019s prompt withdrawal from any Lebanese territories it has occupied or entered. Aboul Gheit was also asked if Hezbollah could be destroyed, to which he replied: \u201cYou cannot destroy an idea.\u201d After they burned down his family home in northern Gaza, Israeli troops separated Ramez al-Skafi from his family and detained him. They had a particular job in mind for him, he said. For the next 11 days in early July, the 30-year-old Palestinian said he was sent into one house after another in his home district, Shuja\u2019iya, watched by his Israeli military minders. According to the account he gave the Guardian, they turned him into a human shield against booby-traps and Hamas gunmen. \u201cI tried to resist their proposal, but they started beating me and the officer told me it was not my choice to make and that I have to do whatever they want,\u201d Skafi said. \u201cHe told me that my work would be searching the houses and telling them information about the homeowners. After some extreme pressure, I was left no choice. \u201cThe next day I was told to go out on patrol with the Israeli soldiers, and I was very scared because of the tanks in front of me and the planes in the sky above me,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen [his minders] noticed my fear, they assured me: \u2018They know you are with us.\u2019\u201d US secretary of state Antony Blinken will depart for the Middle East on Monday, the state department said, as Washington is pushing to kickstart ceasefire negotiations to end the Gaza war after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The top US diplomat\u2019s latest trip to the region, his eleventh since the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that triggered the Gaza war, comes even as Israel has intensified its military campaign in Gaza and in Lebanon against Iran-aligned militia Hezbollah. Blinken will discuss with regional leaders the importance of ending the Gaza war, ways to chart a post-conflict plan for the Palestinian territory, as well as how to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the state department said in a statement. The top diplomat\u2019s trip will start with Israel, the state department said, but did not provide the other exact destinations. \u201cThroughout the region, secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages, and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people,\u201d the state department said in a statement. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati said there was no alternative to UN Resolution 1701, but added that \u201cnew understandings\u201d could be reached to implement it, a statement issued by his office cited him as saying on Monday. A UN peacekeeping mission is mandated by Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006, to help the Lebanese army keep its southern border area with Israel free of weapons or armed personnel other than those of the Lebanese state. Israeli forces blew up homes and besieged schools and shelters for displaced people on Monday as they deepened their operations in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, residents and medics said. They also rounded up men and ordered women to leave the camp, they said. Medics at the Indonesian hospital told Reuters that Israeli troops stormed a school and detained the men before setting the facility ablaze. The fire reached the hospital generators and caused a power outage, they added. Health officials said they refused orders by the Israeli army, which began a new incursion into the north of the Palestinian territory over two weeks ago, to evacuate the three hospitals in the area or leave the patients unattended. Troops remained outside the hospital but did not enter, they said. Medics at a second hospital, Kamal Adwan, reported heavy Israeli fire near the hospital at night. \u201cThe army is burning the schools next to the hospital, and no one can enter or leave the hospital,\u201d said one nurse at the Indonesian hospital, who asked not to be named. Palestinian health officials said 18 people had been killed in Jabalia and eight elsewhere in Gaza in Israeli strikes. The Israeli military has apologised over a strike that killed three Lebanese soldiers in southern Lebanon the previous day, AP reported. It said it is not battling the Lebanese military, and claimed its soldiers believed they were targeting a vehicle belonging to the Hezbollah militant group. Last week, Hezbollah said it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region reckoned with the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Up to 1,000 women and children needing medical care will shortly be evacuated from Gaza to Europe, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s Europe branch said in comments published on Monday. Israel, which is besieging the war-devastated Palestinian territory, \u201cis committed to 1,000 more medical evacuations within the next months to the European Union,\u201d Hans Kluge said in an interview with AFP. He said the evacuations would be facilitated by the WHO \u2013 the United Nations health agency \u2013 and the European countries involved. On Thursday, UN investigators said Israel was deliberately targeting health facilities in Gaza, and killing and torturing medical personnel there, accusing the country of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the occupied Palestinian territories, said in May that about 10,000 people needed evacuating from Gaza for urgent medical care. The WHO Europe has already facilitated 600 medical evacuations from Gaza to seven European countries since the latest war began there in October 2023. \u201cThis would never have happened if we did not keep the dialogue [open],\u201d Kluge said. \u201cThe same [is true] for Ukraine,\u201d he added. \u201cI keep the dialogue [open] with all partners. Iran has warned the UN nuclear watchdog about Israel\u2019s threats against its nuclear sites, foreign ministry, spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday at a weekly news conference. Israel has vowed to attack Iran in retaliation for a volley of Iranian missiles launched on 1 October, leading to widespread speculation that Iran\u2019s nuclear sites could be among Israel\u2019s targets. \u201cThreats to attack nuclear sites are against UN resolutions \u2026. And are condemned \u2026 we have sent a letter about it to \u2026 the UN nuclear watchdog,\u201d Baghaei said in the televised news conference. Ali Daher first heard the explosion and then he felt the pain. An Israeli aircraft loitering high above had shot two rockets at the building next door, collapsing the top two floors and showering him and his two sons with a deadly spray of concrete and jagged metal. The target of the strike was the Dar al-Salaam hotel \u2013 Arabic for \u201chouse of peace\u201d \u2013 in the southern Lebanese town of Wardaniyah, converted in the last weeks into a government displacement centre for 24 families forced to flee their homes under Israeli bombing. Originally a German-Lebanese centre set up to promote cultural understanding, bronze statuettes and pieces of Lebanese antiquities had been pushed to the side to make room for mattresses and boxes of aid. The strike on 9 October killed five people and injured 12. It was the first time that Wardaniyah had been targeted by Israel, but was the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on buildings hosting displaced people in parts of Lebanon thought to be safe and that have otherwise not seen any fighting. \u201cWe wanted to go somewhere safe, where there is no bombing, war or [militias], so we came here. Why did they strike here? We don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ali Daher, a 36-year-old mine clearance operator who was displaced from Tyre, south Lebanon, on 30 September. He held out his fractured wrist and pointed to his one-year-old son Kareem\u2019s arm, which had been bandaged after a piece of debris tore it open. The effects are also being felt in Lebanese society, where local officials have said the fear of strikes have inflamed tensions between members of the country\u2019s many sects and the largely Shia Muslim displaced, who they are afraid to welcome. Unconfirmed rumours of Hezbollah fighters hiding among the displaced have proliferated, despite the vast majority of displaced them being civilians. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced in Lebanon over the last year, most of them since 23 September, when Israel escalated its aerial campaign over wide swathes of the country. Many have sought shelter in Christian and Druze-majority areas that had previously been spared Israeli bombing. US envoy Amos Hochstein will be in Beirut on Monday for talks with Lebanese officials on conditions for a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, two sources in Lebanon told Reuters, as Israel expanded its air campaign on the group\u2019s assets overnight. Israeli strikes late on Sunday hit several branches of a financial institution linked to Hezbollah in Beirut, Lebanon\u2019s south and the Bekaa valley, but no casualties were immediately reported. Israel has reportedly given the United States a document with its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the war in Lebanon, Axios reported on Sunday, citing two US officials and two Israeli officials. Israel has demanded its IDF forces be allowed to engage in \u201cactive enforcement\u201d to make sure Hezbollah doesn\u2019t rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure close to the border, Axios reported, citing an Israeli official. Israel also demanded its air force have freedom of operation in Lebanese airspace, the report added. A US official told Axios it was highly unlikely that Lebanon and the international community would agree to Israel\u2019s conditions. The US military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now \u201cin place\u201d, defence secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, is a critical part of the US military\u2019s layered air defence systems and adds to Israel\u2019s already formidable anti-missile defences. \u201cThe THAAD system is in place,\u201d Austin said, speaking to reporters before his arrival in Ukraine on Monday. He declined to say whether it was operational, but added: \u201cWe have the ability to put it into operation very quickly and we\u2019re on pace with our expectations.\u201d President Joe Biden said the THAAD\u2019s deployment, along with about 100 US soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel, which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on 1 October. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. Israel launched a wave of attacks on buildings belonging to al-Qard al-Hassan, a US-sanctioned financial organisation that has more than 30 branches across Lebanon including 15 in densely populated parts of central Beirut and its suburbs. Lebanon\u2019s national news agency reported 11 strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs late on Sunday. Other strikes hit the association in Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa valley and in the country\u2019s south, NNA added. One strike hit close to Beirut\u2019s airport. The Israeli military had earlier issued a warning that it would begin attacks on infrastructure belonging to the association and ordered people to evacuate those areas, causing panicked crowds and traffic jams to clog the streets of the Lebanese capital. Meanwhile, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) warned that Israel may be causing the \u201cdestruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza\u2019s northernmost governate through death and displacement\u201d with its latest military campaign there. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has made life in north Gaza \u201cimpossible\u201d for Palestinians, many of whom were already facing starvation, while also ordering their displacement and preventing supplies from entering, it said in a statement. Israel has \u201ccontinued to relentlessly bomb and attack the area\u201d making it \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d for civilians to flee, the body wrote, adding that it had received reports of civilians being deliberately targeted. It added: Many Palestinians in the north have also expressed fears that should they flee; they will never be allowed to return to their homes in north Gaza. Israel has attacked two of the three main hospitals in the area \u2013 which were already damaged in previous attacks \u2013 and also bombed schools serving as shelters for displaced people, with many casualties appearing to be women and children, the OHCHR said. The statement ended by reminding Israel of the provisional measures ordered by the international court of justice in January, which said Israel must ensure it did not commit acts of genocide in Gaza and reminded it that as an occupying power, it has a duty to ensure the provision of food, medicine and shelter to the population. The IDF have nominally held complete control of northern Gaza since January, but launched a new assault on the area two weeks ago that they said was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from regrouping. In other developments: Several Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured late on Sunday when Israeli airstrikes hit two schools housing displaced people in Jabalia, the area in northern Gaza that Israel has placed under siege for more than two weeks. Other deadly Israeli attacks took place in Beit Lahia and Gaza City\u2019s al-Tuffah neighbourhood, both in northern Gaza, and in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Israeli forces have \u201cdeliberately demolished an observation tower and perimeter fence of a UN position in Marwahin,\u201d Unifil said on Sunday. The UN peacekeeping mission added: \u201cYet again, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times.\u201d The commander of the Israeli armoured brigade that was leading the Israeli offensive on Jabalia has been killed in northern Gaza, the Israeli military (IDF) has said. Col. Ehsan Daxa, the commander of the 401st Armored Brigade, is the highest ranking Israeli officer to have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on the Palestinian territory last year, according to Israeli media. The US government is investigating an unauthorised release of classified documents that assess Israel\u2019s plans to attack Iran. The US House speaker, Mike Johnson, confirmed the investigation in remarks to CNN\u2019s State of the Union program on Sunday, saying \u201cthe leak is very concerning.\u201d M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has condemned Israel\u2019s siege on the last remaining hospitals in Gaza, saying: \u201cThis is purely and simply a collective punishment imposed on Palestinians in Gaza, who must choose between being forcibly displaced from the North or killed. We fear that this will not stop.\u201d Hezbollah said on Sunday that it launched rockets at Haifa in Israel after the latest Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, Agence France-Presse reports. According to the group, its fighters launched a \u201crocket salvo\u201d at the \u201ccity of Haifa,\u201d adding that it was \u201cin response to the aggressions on [Beirut\u2019s] southern suburbs\u201d from Sunday morning.",

      "bodyText": "The architect of \u201cforced birth\u201d abortion legislation in South Australia has painted high-profile women as being in a \u201cbaby-killers club\u201d on social media. Joanna Howe, who has been credited by politicians in state and federal parliaments for her anti-abortion work, posted artworks of women including the SA Greens leader, Tammy Franks, to Instagram and X. Franks said the posts were \u201cdesigned to promote hatred\u201d. Howe posted the distorted illustrations of the women\u2019s faces under the title \u201cThe Baby-Killers Club\u201d, in a similar style to the popular book series The Baby-Sitters Club. The women depicted voted or argued against legislation Howe helped create, which aimed to make women who sought an abortion after 27 weeks and six days\u2019 gestation instead to be induced and give birth, and either keep the baby or adopt it out. Comments under the post were full of personal vitriol aimed at the women. On Howe\u2019s list were SA\u2019s deputy premier, Susan Close, the minister for women, Katrine Hildyard, the former Liberal deputy premier and attorney general Vickie Chapman, the academic Barbara Baird, the SA Best MLC Connie Bonaros, the public health professor Katina D\u2019Onise and Franks. Howe, an employment law professor at the University of Adelaide, was instrumental in drafting the legislation introduced to parliament by the Liberal frontbencher Ben Hood. He credited her as the legal lead on the bill. It has been described by the Greens and others as \u201cforced birth\u201d legislation. The Howe-Hood bill was narrowly defeated in SA\u2019s upper house last week, 10 votes to nine. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Hood had previously said a woman\u2019s right to end a pregnancy was maintained under the proposal because pregnancy ended when a baby was born. \u201cThe innovation of this bill is that it allows a mother to end her pregnancy throughout all nine months and indeed, right up to birth,\u201d he said. Howe runs a website called Justice for the 45 which claims 45 \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d babies have been killed \u201clegally\u201d since SA laws were reformed to allow abortions after 22 weeks and six days. SA Health data shows that in 2023, the year after the reforms, there were 47 terminations \u2013 less than 1% of all terminations performed \u2013 all because of foetal abnormalities or risks to the mother. Fewer than five terminations were performed after 27 weeks over the 18-month period after the reforms. Abortions after 27 weeks and six days are extremely rare. All later terminations must be approved by two doctors and only be carried out if there is significant risk to the woman and the foetus. Examples include if the foetus has severe abnormalities, or if the woman\u2019s life is at risk \u2013 or her mental health because, for instance, she is the victim of rape, incest or domestic violence. Pregnancies can proceed to a later stage if women are prevented from seeking earlier help or are incapable of seeking help for various reasons. There are also delays in the system, particularly for women living in rural and remote areas. Testing for abnormalities can also delay the process. Franks said concerned friends and family had drawn her attention to Howe\u2019s Instagram post. \u201cIt baffles me why somebody would do that in the first place, and it baffles me further why they\u2019d only target the women members of parliament,\u201d Franks said. Bonaros said she would ask Howe \u201cto reflect on the damage and hurt she has caused \u2013 not to me or my colleagues but to the families impacted\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep comfortably knowing I\u2019ve made the right decision for every woman and family facing the sort of gut-wrenching circumstances that late-term termination brings with it \u2013 and my thoughts are with them and only them,\u201d she said. D\u2019Onise said abortion was \u201cclearly a highly emotive matter\u201d. \u201cMy focus is on high quality, scientific, evidence-based health law, policy and practice,\u201d she said this week. Howe has said she wanted to make abortion \u201cunthinkable\u201d. She appeared in a video with the rightwing Liberal senator Alex Antic talking about a \u201cborn alive\u201d bill he co-sponsored with the LNP senator Matt Canavan and the United Australia party senator Ralph Babet. The \u201cborn alive\u201d concept, promoted for years in the US, falsely claims that babies are routinely born alive after abortions. Howe also filmed a video with Robbie Katter, from Katter\u2019s Australian party, about his \u201cborn alive\u201d legislation. Katter has said he would consider forcing a vote to recriminalise abortion in Queensland, contributing to abortion becoming a bigger issue in that state\u2019s election campaign. Other politicians have cited Howe when arguing for restricted access to abortion. She is a vocal opponent of women who have abortions being eligible for the federal government\u2019s stillborn baby payment, and told Sky News that women having a later-stage termination were \u201cintentionally inducing a child stillborn\u201d. The Labor MLC Russell Wortley said in the SA parliament during the forced birth debate that there were \u201cno sources or references about the position [Howe] takes\u201d and that it was \u201cnot supported by her employer\u201d, the university. Wortley said he had received information debunking \u201cevery single item\u201d Howe had raised. Howe did not initially respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s questions directly but said on Instagram that Guardian Australia was writing a \u201chit piece\u201d on her. Asked why there were only women on the \u201cbaby-killers club\u201d list, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure there are only women on the list.\u201d There are only women on the list. Guardian Australia asked Howe whether referring to the \u201cbaby-killers club\u201d was appropriate, whether the posts were designed to promote hatred, whether she described herself as a feminist, how she thought her posts might affect the women named and women who had abortions, and whether she believed women had abortions to access stillborn payments. Howe did not respond directly to Guardian Australia\u2019s questions but read them out on Instagram and subsequently posted graphic details and animations of abortions and said she thought the \u201cbaby-killers club\u201d description was \u201cpretty apt\u201d. She later sent a link to her Instagram post to Guardian Australia.

Here\u2019s more, from the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carter-sherman\">Carter Sherman</a>:</em></p> <p>When Jennifer Adkins and her husband were considering having a second child in Idaho, they vaguely thought how the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban could affect them. But Adkins\u2019 first pregnancy had gone so smoothly, she didn\u2019t even use an epidural when she gave birth. Her next pregnancy, she expected, would be similar.</p> <p>But in April 2023, 12 weeks into her second pregnancy, an ultrasound scan shattered that hope.</p> <p>The ultrasound indicated a litany of issues with the fetus, whom Adkins and her husband had taken to calling \u201cSpooky\u201d, since Adkins\u2019 due date was Halloween. Spooky, Adkins learned, showed multiple signs of a chromosomal disorder as well as dangerously severe swelling. Together, these conditions usually lead to a miscarriage or death shortly after delivery, Adkins\u2019 doctors told her. And if the pregnancy continued, Adkins herself was at risk of developing life-threatening pre-eclampsia and swelling.</p> <p>As the mother of a toddler son, Adkins was not willing to take that chance.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that you understand, until you are in that situation, how scary and how awful that actually is,\u201d Adkins said during a recent interview at a coffee shop outside Boise.</p> <p>Under Idaho law, abortions are permitted in medical emergencies. But although Adkins\u2019 health was in jeopardy, her doctors didn\u2019t believe her case was enough of an emergency to legally end the pregnancy. They were too afraid of Idaho\u2019s ban to even refer<strong> </strong>her to an out-of-state abortion clinic.</p> <p>So<strong> </strong>Adkins and her husband frantically called clinics in Washington, Oregon and Utah, trying to find somewhere within driving distance that was not booked up for weeks with other patients fleeing the<strong> </strong>abortion bans now blanketing the US. The couple also scrambled for financial support to pay for the procedure and travel. If they had to shoulder all those costs on their own, the family would be at risk of being unable to afford their mortgage.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about all these logistics when all you want to think about is grieving the loss of a baby that you really wanted,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cNone of us feel good about making that decision.

On Sunday, Harris celebrated her 60th birthday and gave an interview with Rev Al Sharpton on MSNBC.</p> <p>Sharpton asked her about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/20/us-presidential-election-trump-harris-updates\">Trump calling her a \u201cshit vice-president\u201d at a rally in Latrobe</a>, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.</p> <p>Harris, who became the first black vice-president and woman in the role after Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential election, responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The American people deserve so much better.

The contest on 5 November will be decided by the slimmest of margins.

Some links and key events from the day: Liz Cheney, former Republican congresswoman and longtime opponent of abortion rights, condemned Republican bans on the procedure and urged conservatives on Monday to support Kamala Harris. Jill Biden acknowledged on Monday that her husband made \u201cthe right call\u201d by stepping down from his run for re-election. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, said Elon Musk\u2019s plan to give away $1m a day in support of Donald Trump is a reflection of a ticket with \u201cno plan\u201d. The Central Park Five sued Trump for defamation after he falsely said during the presidential debate that they had pleaded guilty to a brutal rape 35 years ago, despite the fact that they had their convictions overturned. A Republican county supervisor in Arizona who refused to certify the 2022 midterm election has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The politics writer Olivia Nuzzi and New York magazine have parted ways after she was placed on leave following the disclosure that she had engaged in a \u201cpersonal\u201d relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr. Key rightwing legal groups tied to Trump and his allies have banked millions of dollars from conservative foundations and filed multiple lawsuits challenging voting rules in swing states. Trump doubled down on false claims about the federal government\u2019s hurricane recovery efforts and promoted baseless conspiracy theories about immigration. Donald Trump is now on stage at a campaign event in Concord, North Carolina, with faith leaders. His former housing secretary, Ben Carson, spoke before the ex-president arrived, saying the election would determine whether the US is a secular nation or one under God: \u201cWe\u2019re as close to losing it right now as we have been at any point in time.\u201d The former president leaned into religious messaging, saying of his assassination attempt, \u201cGod saved me for a purpose.\u201d He also said: \u201cWe embrace followers of Jesus,\u201d and later added: I\u2019m here tonight to deliver a simple message to Christians across America. It\u2019s time to stand up and save your country. Throughout his campaign, Trump has embraced a rightwing Christian worldview, working with evangelical leaders who have claimed he is \u201canointed\u201d to fight \u201cspiritual warfare\u201d against Democrats, the AP recently reported. Read more here form the Guardian\u2019s past reporting on Christian nationalists\u2019 embrace of Trump during the election: Joe Biden gave a shoutout to Kamala Harris at a ceremony honoring winners of the National Medals of Arts and National Humanities Medals, AP reports: \u201cI know the power of the women in this room to get things done\u201d and boost the next generation, Biden told the crowd, which included singer and actor Queen Latifah and poet Joy Harjo. He added that female winners were \u201cproving a woman can do anything a man can do, and then some, that includes being president of the United States of America\u201d. Biden\u2019s nod to the vice-president was met with a standing ovation, according to the AP. Hollywood heavyweights were in attendance, including Spike Lee, Steven Spielberg and Aaron Sorkin. A Republican county supervisor in rural Arizona who refused to certify the 2022 midterm election has agreed to a plea deal, becoming the first person criminally sanctioned for refusing to certify an election since 2020. Peggy Judd, a Republican supervisor in Cochise county, Arizona, agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge for failing or refusing to perform an official duty by an election officer. She will serve an unsupervised probation of at least 90 days and pay a maximum $500 fine, Arizona\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Kris Mayes, said in a press release announcing the plea deal on Monday. Judd, who is still in office, will preside over the presidential election next month and be required to certify its results. The attorney general\u2019s office said in court on Monday that the probation term lasted through the 2024 certification and that if Judd again refused, she would be in violation of her probation and would face up to 30 days in jail for the violation, the local outlet Capitol Media Services reported. More here: Judges in Michigan and North Carolina have ruled against two Republican lawsuits today seeking to challenge the legitimacy of ballots from Americans overseas, NPR reports. A state judge in Michigan dismissed a recent Republican National Committee legal complaint that alleged certain overseas voters from the state were not eligible to cast ballots. The Michigan judge said the law \u201cbars this 11th hour attempt to disenfranchise these electors\u201d and that Republicans were seeking to challenge language from the state secretary of state\u2019s office that is \u201cconsistent with federal and state law, and the Michigan constitution\u201d. And a North Carolina judge rejected a \u201crequest for the court to order that returned ballots of some overseas voters be set aside and not counted until the voters\u2019 eligibility can be confirmed\u201d, NPR reported. That judge said there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence\u201d that anyone had taken advantage of the overseas rules and cast a fraudulent ballot. From 2023 through September 2024, the committee and its affiliates have filed or been involved in 72 election lawsuits, a major legal blitz that experts say is designed to sow doubt about the results if Trump loses. More background on those cases here: Donald Trump repeated a litany of falsehoods and conspiracy theories about Hurricane Helene and the federal government\u2019s response while campaigning in North Carolina today. The former president falsely suggested, once again, that federal money meant for hurricane relief was \u201cspent \u2026 on illegal migrants\u201d. There is no basis for the claim that disaster funding was reallocated to services related to immigration. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which also oversees the major US immigration agencies. But money allocated for a program to help migrants is separate and unrelated to disaster response funds. Trump also falsely implied that the Democrats were spending money on undocumented people so that they could \u201cvote in the election\u201d, reiterating his frequently cited baseless claim about election fraud. He also claimed Fema\u2019s money is \u201call gone\u201d. But this is false, CNN noted, as the federal agency told the network last week that its disaster relief fund had roughly $8.5bn remaining. More here: As Kamala Harris\u2019s Michigan rally with Liz Cheney comes to a close, moderator Maria Shriver asks the vice-president how she copes with the stress of the race and what her message is to voters who are struggling with anxiety over the election. Harris says, \u201cI wake up in the middle of the night usually these days \u2026 but I work out every morning. I think that\u2019s really important [for] mind, body and spirit \u2026 I try to eat well. I love my family, and I make sure that I talk to the kids and my husband every day \u2026 My family grounds me in every way.\u201d The vice-president adds: We cannot despair \u2026 Every individual has the power to make a decision about what this will be \u2026 so let\u2019s not feel powerless. I get the overwhelming nature of this all makes us feel powerless \u2026 That\u2019s not our character as American people. We are not one to be defeated. We rise to a moment.\u201d Liz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman now campaigning with Kamala Harris in Michigan, outlines Trump\u2019s threats on foreign policy: He heaps praise on the world\u2019s most evil people, while he attacks with venom his political opponents here at home \u2026 If you look at where the Republican party is today, there\u2019s been a really dangerous embrace of isolationism, a dangerous embrace of tyrants \u2026 Don\u2019t think that Congress can stop him \u2026 all he has to do is what he\u2019s doing and say, I won\u2019t fulfill our Nato treaty obligations, and Nato begins to unravel. Liz Cheney, campaigning with Kamala Harris in Michigan, criticizes commentators who assert that the vice-president isn\u2019t ready to be president: She is supremely qualified to be president of the United States. There sometimes are some men who suggest that she\u2019s not, but if you look at her qualifications, there\u2019s no question that she\u2019s somebody that I know I can count on, who will put the good of this country first. Cheney also emphasizes her conservative credentials while explaining her support for Harris: \u201cThe very first campaign I ever volunteered in was for President Gerald Ford \u2026 and ever since then, I have been voting for Republicans. I\u2019ve never voted for a Democrat.\u201d Maria Shriver asks Kamala Harris and Liz Cheney if they ever imagined they would be campaigning together. Harris says she has long worked with Republicans, and given the threat Donald Trump poses, she is not surprised to be standing with the former Republican congresswoman: What is at stake in this election is so fundamental for us as Americans \u2026 Do we take seriously the importance of a president who obeys the oath to be loyal to the constitution of the United States? Do we prioritize a president \u2026 who cares about the rule of law? Cheney says: \u201cEveryone who watched January 6th knows what Donald Trump is willing to do.\u201d She adds: I could have just said I\u2019m going to do everything I can to work against Donald Trump, and there are a lot of Republicans who have said that \u2026 I have decided, and I am very proud, and I\u2019m honored to have made the decision to endorse Vice-President Harris \u2026 As a mother, I want my children to know that there is someone sitting in the Oval Office that they can look up to, someone who can be a role model. Shriver asks Cheney if she was afraid to endorse Harris, knowing the backlash she\u2019d face. Cheney shares a message to Republicans who want to support the Democratic ticket, but are afraid: \u201cYou can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody \u2026 Vote him out.\u201d Maria Shriver, former first lady of California, has taken the stage at Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign event in Royal Oak, Michigan, with Liz Cheney. Shriver starts off by making a pitch for bipartisanship, saying: \u201cI served as a Democratic first lady in a Republican administration in California. So I get this bipartisan thing. I\u2019ve seen it up close. And now I\u2019m a proud independent \u2026 People of both parties used to get along really well.\u201d Kamala Harris will soon make another appearance with Liz Cheney at a campaign event in Royal Oak, Michigan. Earlier in the day, the vice-president and former conservative congresswoman made their pitch in Pennsylvania, geared toward Republican voters. Cheney said: I\u2019m a conservative, and I know that the most conservative of all conservative principles is being faithful to the constitution. And you have to choose in this race between someone who has been faithful to the constitution, who will be faithful, and Donald Trump, who is not just us predicting how he will act. We watched what he did after the last election. Trump then went on to insinuate that he had been told he was a better president than George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. He was harping on the border and the alleged ills of undocumented people, before going on to say that the border patrol had endorsed him. That\u2019s not quite true \u2013 the government agency has not endorsed him, but its union, the Border Patrol Council has. Undeterred, Trump went on: They\u2019re great. They endorsed your favorite president. They didn\u2019t only endorse me, saying I\u2019m the greatest president there\u2019s ever been \u2026 What about George Washington? No, you\u2019re better. What about Lincoln? What about Abraham Lincoln? No, you\u2019re better, they said, I\u2019m tougher on the border than Abraham Lincoln. The former president appeared to try to hit back at claims that, at the age of 78, he is \u201ccognitively impaired\u201d. But Trump raised more questions than he answered by jumbling his words. The moment came as he told the crowd in North Carolina, in a somewhat confusing anecdote, that he was talking to someone from the state on the phone, but was then distracted by watching one of Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX rockets land. He told the person on the phone to wait while he watched the rocket, then forgot he was on the phone. \u201cI forgot he was on the phone because, and now they, all these idiots back there, will say he\u2019s cognitively impaired because he put he\u2019s cognitively impaired,\u201d Trump said, apparently referring to reporters in attendance. \u201cYou know, I do this stuff, five, six, seven times a day for 52 days without a break,\u201d he said, by way of explanation for his misstatements. He appeared to then lose his train of thought: I\u2019ll tell you what they are, really not all of them, not all of them. I\u2019d say about 92% couple of good ones. That\u2019s a lot of cameras going on. There are a couple of good ones back there. Now it is crazy in the crazy what they do, and the level of meanness. Trump is now onstage in Greenville, North Carolina, where he\u2019s been whipping up the crowd with his usual attacks on Kamala Harris. Earlier in the day, he took note of Harris\u2019s campaigning alongside Liz Cheney. On Truth Social, Trump implied that Arab voters \u2013 significant communities of which live in Michigan, a battleground state \u2013 are unlikely to look kindly on the vice-president associating with the daughter of Dick Cheney, who, as vice-president under George W Bush, was an architect of the US invasion of Iraq: Arab voters are indeed a source of concern for Democrats, though mostly over the Biden administration\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. Here\u2019s more on that, from the Guardian\u2019s Stephen Starr: Donald Trump is scheduled to soon take the stage in North Carolina, which hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 2008 but where polls have indicated Kamala Harris may have a fighting chance this year. Trump earlier in the day visited western parts of the state damaged by Hurricane Helene, and is now rallying in Greenville, on North Carolina\u2019s eastern side. He was introduced by adviser Stephen Miller, who was the architect of the hardline immigration policies Trump allowed during his presidency. \u201cFor eight long years, Donald Trump has been fighting for us in the arena. What he has endured, what he has been through on this journey,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey came after him, they came after his family, they came after his children, they came after his businesses, they came after his freedom, and they came after his life, and he\u2019s still standing strong. He is still standing tall. And with your help, North Carolina, Donald J Trump is going to save the United States of America.\u201d The former president then invited Adam Smith, a former Green Beret who has helped relief efforts in the Asheville area since Hurricane Helene devastated the area just over three weeks ago, to speak. At the podium, Smith thanked Trump for coming to the area. \u201cThe biggest fear that western North Carolina is sitting on right now, at least in the communities we\u2019ve talked to, is being forgotten,\u201d Smith said. \u201cTo have you here and have an opportunity to have this conversation at a national level, will keep western North Carolina on the map, and not leave the communities holding the bag on the back end of this, so we\u2019re very grateful that you\u2019ve shown up,\u201d Smith said to the former president. Trump continued his remarks by accusing the federal government of leaving North Carolinians \u201chelpless and abandoned\u201d after Hurricane Helene. \u201cIn the wake of this horrible storm, many Americans in this region felt helpless and abandoned and left behind by their government, and yet, in North Carolina\u2019s hour of desperation, the American people answered the call much more so than your federal government, unfortunately,\u201d Trump said. \u201cCitizens poured into western North Carolina from all over the country, bringing food, water, fuel, medical aid, even helicopters.\u201d \u201cNothing is more inspiring than to see the American spirit triumph over adversity with the most selfless acts of generosity and love\u201d he added. Donald Trump held a press conference in western North Carolina, where he surveyed the damage wrought by Hurricane Helene and attacked the federal government\u2019s recovery efforts. \u201cDriving up here you see the kind of destruction, actually incredible\u201d he said. \u201cThe power of nature, nothing you can do about it but you got to get a little bit better crew in to do a better job than has been done by the White House, because it\u2019s not good, not good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here today in western North Carolina to express a simple message to the incredible people of the state, I\u2019m with you and the American people are with you all the way\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are going to continue to be with you, we will see what happens with the election and on January 20th I think you are going to have a new crew coming in to do it properly and help you in a proper manner.\u201d Trump also addressed those who had lost family members and loved ones to the storm. \u201cTo everyone who has lost a loved one ... we ask God to give you comfort and peace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a terrible ordeal and this area was hit about as hard as anyone has ever seen....the communities were ravaged and destroyed, we are praying for you and we will not forget about you.\u201d Trump\u2019s repeated criticisms of the federal response to Hurricane Helene comes as the director of Fema condemned the former president and his supporters for spreading misinformation about the hurricane and the response by the federal disaster agency, which, the director said, has hampered the government\u2019s ability to get people the help they need. Donald Trump has long drawn criticism before over his statements about the Central Park Five, a group of men who were exonerated after being wrongly convicted for a crime and who earlier today sued him. After the jogger\u2019s assault, he spoke out about the case and took out a full-page ad in several New York newspapers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty, Reuters reports. Trump in 2019 stood by his prior comments about the Central Park Five, and declined to apologize. The Guardian adds that at the debate with Kamala Harris last month, Trump said of the men: \u201cThey pled guilty\u2026They killed a person, ultimately.\u201d The five then-boys, who were tried as adults, actually pleaded not guilty. And the victim, Trisha Meili, although almost killed, was found unconscious in the park, survived and testified in court. Yusef Salaam watched the debate in Philadelphia, afterwards telling the Washington Post in an interview: \u201cHere we are right now, full-circle moment, being able to be participants in this great democracy on the cusp of everything really powerfully supporting Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d The five Black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted for the 1989 rape of a white jogger in New York\u2019s Central Park have sued Donald Trump for defamation over statements he made at last month\u2019s US presidential debate, Reuters reported. Known widely as the Central Park Five, the defendants spent between five and 13 years in prison before they were cleared in 2002 based on new DNA evidence and the confession of another person. Trump falsely said at the September 10 debate with presidential rival Kamala Harris that the Central Park Five had killed a person and pleaded guilty. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Philadelphia by Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron Brown and Korey Wise, called Trump\u2019s statements \u201cdemonstrably false.\u201d A spokesperson for Trump\u2019s campaign called the case \u201cjust another frivolous, election interference lawsuit, filed by desperate left-wing activists.\u201d A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Shanin Specter, said in a statement that Trump\u2019s remarks \u201ccast them in a harmful false light and intentionally inflicted emotional distress on them.\u201d The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages for reputational and emotional harms as well as punitive damages. Kamala Harris is on tour of the three Great Lakes swing states with Liz Cheney, a Republican former congresswoman who broke with her party over their support for Donald Trump. In their first event together in a Philadelphia suburb, Harris warned voters to take Trump seriously, while Cheney said she came around to backing the Democrats because she does not think the former president will stand up for American allies. They will appear together in metro Detroit and then Milwaukee before the day is through. Meanwhile, Tim Walz was on daytime talk staple \u201cThe View\u201d, where he said that Trump\u2019s comments about deploying the national guard against his political enemies was a sign that he planned to bend the country\u2019s \u201cconstitutional guardrails\u201d. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: The White House proposed an expansion of contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) that will allow women to access birth control without a prescription. Harris has scheduled an interview with NBC News from her home at the Naval Observatory in Washington DC on Tuesday. A new poll found Trump may have lost his edge among voters when it comes to handling the economy, while Harris is viewed more favorably overall. Kamala Harris\u2019s push for the support of Republican voters won her the support of the daughter of Gerald Ford, the late Republican former president who served from 1974 to 1977. Susan Ford Bales\u2019s endorsement is perhaps most consequential in Michigan, the ex-president\u2019s home and also a swing state coveted by both candidates. The Detroit News has Bales\u2019s statement: As they wrapped up their joint event in Pennsylvania, Liz Cheney was asked to give something of a closing argument to her fellow Republicans for why they should support Kamala Harris. The former congresswoman said: I think that in this election, and especially here in Pennsylvania, we have the opportunity to tell the whole world who we are, and we have the chance to say, you know, we\u2019re going to reject cruelty. We\u2019re going to reject the kind of vile vitriol that we\u2019ve seen from Donald Trump. We\u2019re going to reject the misogyny from Donald Trump and JD Vance. And we have the chance in this race to elect somebody who, you know is going to defend the rule of law. You know, vice-president Harris is going to defend our constitution. We have the chance to remind people that we are a good country. We are a good and honorable people. We are a great nation and in this race, we have the opportunity to vote for and support somebody you can count on. We\u2019re not always going to agree, but I know vice-president Harris will always do what she believes is right for this country. She has a sincere heart, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m honored to be here. Thus concluded the first of three joint events the pair will do today. They now fly to Michigan for an event in the Detroit suburbs, followed by another in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. All three states are part of the Democrats\u2019 \u201cBlue Wall\u201d of swing states along the Great Lakes where voters traditionally back the party, but where polls show Harris is locked in a tight race against Donald Trump. Liz Cheney\u2019s support for Kamala Harris is somewhat inexplicable. She was a conservative Republican in Congress who supported almost none of the Democrats\u2019 legislative priorities, but her break with Donald Trump led to her falling out with the party, and losing her seat. She is also the daughter of Dick Cheney, the former vice-president who was an ardent supporter of the US invasion of Iraq. Asked at the event alongside Harris about how she came around to backing Democratic national security priorities, Cheney noted that hundreds of national security officials have endorsed the vice-president, and said Trump\u2019s policies were too dangerous to tolerate: The choice here, with respect to national security policy, is a man who has proven, he\u2019s absolutely proven, that he will not stand up, he won\u2019t defend this nation with respect to our own constitution and rule of law. And vice-president Harris, who has been clear in terms of support for Ukraine, in terms of recognizing and understanding across the board that America cannot maintain our own freedom and security if we walk away from our allies around the world. Donald Trump has taken an almost humorous tack to his campaign lately, including holding a staged campaign event at a McDonald\u2019s over the weekend that saw him work the drive-thru window. Speaking alongside Liz Cheney, Kamala Harris warned voters not to fall for his jokes: In many, many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of him being president of the United States are brutally serious. There are things that he says that will be the subject of skits and laughter and jokes, but words have meaning coming from someone who aspires to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. These are the things that are at stake. Harris and Cheney\u2019s event in Malvern, Pennsylvania is set up as a moderated conversation with Sarah Longwell, the publisher of the Bulwark and the leader of a group called Republican Voters Against Trump. Longwell began by asking Harris and Cheney about their unusual decision to campaign together. Harris replied: I think that this moment, with the choice that the American people have in this election, in two weeks and one day, this election is presenting, for the first time, probably in certainly recent history, a very clear choice and difference between the two nominees. And I think that is what, as much as anything, is bringing us as Americans together who are understanding that we cannot, with such fundamental stakes being presented, afford to be mired in ideological differences without really staking our claim to the most fundamental ideals upon which our country stands. And here\u2019s Cheney\u2019s answer: For me, every single thing in my experience and in my background has played a part in my decision to endorse vice-president Harris. And, you know, that that begins with the fact that I\u2019m a conservative, and I know that the most conservative of all conservative principles is being faithful to the constitution. And you have to choose in this race between someone who has been faithful to the constitution, who will be faithful, and Donald Trump, who is not just us predicting how he will act. We watched what he did after the last election. Kamala Harris is soon to take the stage in Malvern, Pennsylvania, where she will be campaigning with Republican former congresswoman Liz Cheney. It\u2019s one of three events in each of the Great Lakes battleground states she will do today with Cheney, who lost her primary two years ago after falling out with Donald Trump. The push is part of the Harris campaign\u2019s efforts to win over moderate voters in key areas who they believe can be persuaded not to back the former president. We\u2019ll let you know what the vice-president has to say. Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate is being interviewed on ABC daytime talk staple \u201cThe View\u201d right now, where he warned that Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments about sending the national guard after \u201cthe enemy within\u201d \u2013 as he has taken to calling his political enemies \u2013 is a sign that he is willing to bend America\u2019s \u201cconstitutional guardrails\u201d. \u201cThe guardrails are off with Donald Trump right now,\u201d Walz said. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist, but our systems are strained, and the ability to politicize the military has never been tried in this country. He\u2019s trying it.\u201d Walz also took a crack at answering the question of what Harris would do differently as president than Joe Biden. Trump\u2019s campaign attacked the vice-president last week after she said she wouldn\u2019t do anything differently, comments she then had to walk back. Here\u2019s what Walz said: Kamala Harris will be joined on the campaign trail today by Liz Cheney, a Republican former congresswoman who lost her primary because of her opposition to Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Cheney, who was the top Republican on the January 6 committee, expressed doubts that Republican House speaker and Trump ally Mike Johnson would certify Harris\u2019s election win. \u201cI do not have faith that Mike Johnson will fulfill his constitutional obligations,\u201d she said on NBC. Axios reported yesterday that Johnson reached out to Cheney by text message to object to her comments. \u201cWe had a little debate in conversation, on text message, back and forth and agreed to disagree,\u201d the speaker told Axios, adding that he told Cheney \u201chow disappointed I was in that, to make things personal, because I\u2019ve not done that.\u201d He continued: You know the idea that President Trump is somehow a danger to the Republic, and that any of us who support him are a danger or would not fulfill our constitutional obligations, all these things that have been said are it\u2019s just nonsense. She knows, she knows me. She used to know me well and knows that I\u2019m a constitutional conservative, and I take all matters at this level very seriously, and I will fulfill my constitutional oath. And to say otherwise is just dishonest. In her own statement to Axios, Cheney said: \u201cMike knows this is a conscious choice between right and wrong and can\u2019t honestly rationalize supporting Trump on this.\u201d Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic governor Josh Shapiro has suggested that law enforcement should investigate Elon Musk\u2019s handout of checks to encourage people to vote for Donald Trump, the Guardian\u2019s Anna Betts reports: Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, said law enforcement should look into Elon Musk\u2019s new ploy to give $1m to a registered voter who signs a petition supporting free speech in key swing states each day until the US presidential election. Legal experts have said it appears to violate laws that prohibit giving incentives to people to register to vote. On Sunday, Shapiro expressed similar concerns. Monday is Pennsylvania\u2019s deadline to register to vote. \u201cI think there are real questions with how he is spending money in this race, how the dark money is flowing, not just into Pennsylvania, but apparently now into the pockets of Pennsylvanians,\u201d Shapiro told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday. \u201cThat is deeply concerning.\u201d Later in the interview Shapiro added: \u201cI think it\u2019s something that law enforcement should take a look at. I\u2019m not the attorney general any more of Pennsylvania, I\u2019m the governor, but it does raise serious questions.\u201d Kamala Harris will sit for an interview with NBC News tomorrow from her home at the Naval Observatory in Washington DC, the network announced. The vice-president will speak to Hallie Jackson as she steps up her interviews and media appearances ahead of the 5 November election. The interview is set to air at 6.30pm on Tuesday. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released this morning contained some positive news for Kamala Harris, though there\u2019s no telling if it is predictive of the election outcome. The survey found that Harris is viewed more favorably than Donald Trump, including among the independent voters that could decide the seven swing states. It also reported that Trump no longer appears to have the advantage he once did on handling of economic issues, even though the former president has made that a centerpiece of his campaign with accusations that Democratic policies have driven up prices. That\u2019s one of two main messages he\u2019s been pushing, along with promises to crack down on migrants \u2013 an area on which the poll finds Trump maintains his advantage. Here\u2019s what it found about the two candidates\u2019 favorability: Registered voters\u2019 opinions of the candidates have not changed much since last month. In general Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, are viewed more positively than Trump or JD Vance. A large majority of Democratic voters have positive views of Harris and Walz, and Republicans voters feel favorably toward Trump and Vance. Independent voters are closely divided in their opinion of Harris while most have a negative view of Trump. Independent voters have similar opinions about both vice-presidential candidates. When it comes to economic issues, 40% of registered voters trust Harris to handle the cost of groceries and gas, and 42% trust Trump. Six percent trust both equally, and 12% neither. On the cost of housing, Harris is more trusted with 42% support to Trump\u2019s 37%, while 7% truth both and 14% trust neither. The Washington Post released a comprehensive new poll this morning that tells us \u2026 not much new. For weeks, surveys of swing states have found Donald Trump and Kamala Harris effectively tied, and the Post\u2019s poll, conducted with George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government, is no different. The two candidates are neck-in-neck nationally, and within the poll\u2019s margin of error in the seven states that are expected to decide the election. Here\u2019s what they found: A Washington Post-Schar School poll of more than 5,000 registered voters, conducted in the first half of October, finds 47 percent who say they will definitely or probably support Harris while 47 percent say they will definitely or probably support Trump. Among likely voters, 49 percent support Harris and 48 percent back Trump. Trump\u2019s support is little changed from the 48 percent he received in a spring survey of six key states using the same methodology, but Harris\u2019s standing is six percentage points higher than the 41-percent support registered for President Joe Biden, who was then a candidate. \u2026 Among these key-state voters, Harris runs strongest in Georgia, where she has an advantage of six percentage points among registered voters and four points among likely voters, which is within the margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Harris also is slightly stronger than Trump in the three most contested northern states \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 but by percentages within the margin of error. The seventh battleground state, Nevada, is tied among likely voters though Harris is three points stronger than Trump among registered voters. Our own poll tracker reaches much the same conclusion: We reported earlier that Kamala Harris has a huge advantage in campaign cash over Donald Trump. But the former president has his own deep-pocketed backer in the former of Tesla boss Elon Musk, who held a strange town hall in swing state Pennsylvania this weekend where he started handing out mammoth checks to voters to get them to back Trump. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland witnessed the spectacle in person: Standing before a large US flag, which spanned the breadth of a vast stage, the world\u2019s richest man told an assembled crowd that he loved them. \u201cThis kind of energy lights a fire in my soul,\u201d he said, having just made one of the crowd a millionaire after everyone chanted his name. His love \u2013 and that $1m \u2013 of course, was contingent on them all doing exactly as Elon Musk wanted: signing a petition tied to his political action committee (Pac) , which is dedicated to sending Donald Trump back to the White House. The spectacle was both surreal and potentially illegal. But no one here, not least Musk himself, seemed to care in the slightest. The billionaire was in Pittsburgh on his final stop across the vital swing state of Pennsylvania, having donated $75m to help get Trump re-elected, and seemingly willing to accept a job offer in Trump\u2019s government should he win. Musk\u2019s latest ploy to assist Trump to attain more political power, has been to give away $1m every day to a member of the public, provided they also live in a swing state and are registered to vote. The stunt is prohibited and akin to buying votes, in the view of some experts, as it violates federal election law preventing payments for registering to vote. The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, on Sunday described it as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and encouraged law enforcement to \u201ctake a look at\u201d. Musk\u2019s America Pac did not respond to a list of questions from the Guardian after the Pittsburgh town hall. In a statement released as his administration announced a proposed rule that would allow women to receive birth control without a prescription under the Affordable Care Act, Joe Biden signaled that the move was part of an effort to highlight the differences between the two parties on the issue. \u201cSince Roe v Wade was overturned more than two years ago, Republican elected officials have made clear they want to ban or restrict birth control, defund federal programs that help women access contraception, and repeal the Affordable Care Act. And Congressional Republicans have repeatedly blocked federal legislation to safeguard the fundamental right to birth control for women in every state. It\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d the president said, continuing: Today, my Administration is taking a major step to expand contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This new action would help ensure that millions of women with private health insurance can access the no-cost contraception they need. Vice President Harris and I have worked tirelessly to protect and build on the Affordable Care Act. We lowered costs for Marketplace coverage by an average of $800 per year for millions of Americans, and more Americans than ever before have signed up for health insurance through the law. At a time when contraception access is under attack, Vice President Harris and I are resolute in our commitment to expanding access to quality, affordable contraception. We believe that women in every state must have the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family. We will continue to fight to protect access to reproductive health care and call on Congress to restore reproductive freedom and safeguard the right to contraception once and for all. While the Biden administration has moved to expand contraception access, Donald Trump, if returned to the White House, will likely pursue policies that make it harder to access reproductive care, particularly abortions. Here\u2019s more, from the Guardian\u2019s Carter Sherman: When Jennifer Adkins and her husband were considering having a second child in Idaho, they vaguely thought how the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban could affect them. But Adkins\u2019 first pregnancy had gone so smoothly, she didn\u2019t even use an epidural when she gave birth. Her next pregnancy, she expected, would be similar. But in April 2023, 12 weeks into her second pregnancy, an ultrasound scan shattered that hope. The ultrasound indicated a litany of issues with the fetus, whom Adkins and her husband had taken to calling \u201cSpooky\u201d, since Adkins\u2019 due date was Halloween. Spooky, Adkins learned, showed multiple signs of a chromosomal disorder as well as dangerously severe swelling. Together, these conditions usually lead to a miscarriage or death shortly after delivery, Adkins\u2019 doctors told her. And if the pregnancy continued, Adkins herself was at risk of developing life-threatening pre-eclampsia and swelling. As the mother of a toddler son, Adkins was not willing to take that chance. \u201cI don\u2019t think that you understand, until you are in that situation, how scary and how awful that actually is,\u201d Adkins said during a recent interview at a coffee shop outside Boise. Under Idaho law, abortions are permitted in medical emergencies. But although Adkins\u2019 health was in jeopardy, her doctors didn\u2019t believe her case was enough of an emergency to legally end the pregnancy. They were too afraid of Idaho\u2019s ban to even refer her to an out-of-state abortion clinic. So Adkins and her husband frantically called clinics in Washington, Oregon and Utah, trying to find somewhere within driving distance that was not booked up for weeks with other patients fleeing the abortion bans now blanketing the US. The couple also scrambled for financial support to pay for the procedure and travel. If they had to shoulder all those costs on their own, the family would be at risk of being unable to afford their mortgage. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about all these logistics when all you want to think about is grieving the loss of a baby that you really wanted,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cNone of us feel good about making that decision. But it is a loving choice that we should be able to make for our family.\u201d The Biden administration has proposed allowing women with private health insurance to receive birth control without a prescription, in a major expansion of contraception access. The rule is under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and comes as Kamala Harris and Democrats nationwide seek to make voters aware of their support for reproductive rights ahead of the 5 November election. Here\u2019s what Harris had to say about the proposed rule: Today, our Administration is proposing the largest expansion of contraception coverage in more than a decade. This new proposed rule will build on our Administration\u2019s work to protect reproductive freedom by providing millions of women with more options for the affordable contraception they need and deserve. That includes coverage for no-cost over-the-counter contraception without a prescription for the first time in our nation\u2019s history. These lower contraception costs would be in addition to the billions of dollars that women have already saved on contraception under the Affordable Care Act which President Biden and I have strengthened since taking office. On Thursday, former Democratic US President, Barack Obama, is expected to campaign with Kamala Harris in Georgia, a state Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020. Michelle Obama plans to join Harris for a rally - to encourage people to get out and vote - in Michigan on Saturday as early voting begins in the state that helped propel Donald Trump to victory in 2016, before Biden took it back in 2020. Barack Obama, who become America\u2019s first black president when he was elected in 2008, campaigned for Harris for the first time, appearing alone in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in early October. He held a rally for Harris in Las Vegas over the weekend on the first day of early voting in Nevada. As my colleague Michael Sainato notes in this story, the Obamas and Harris have a friendship stretching over two decades. Harris was an early supporter of Obama\u2019s presidential campaign in the closely contested 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, and one of the few elected officials in California to back him over Hillary Clinton for the party\u2019s nomination. Key rightwing legal groups with ties to Donald Trump and his allies have banked millions of dollars from conservative foundations and filed multiple lawsuits challenging voting rules in swing states that are already sowing distrust of election processes and pushing dangerous conspiracy theories, election watchdogs warn. They also warn that the groups appear to be laying the groundwork for a concerted challenge to the result of November\u2019s presidential election if Trump is defeated by Kamala Harris. America First Legal and the Public Interest Legal Foundation together reaped more than $30m dollars from the Wisconsin based Bradley Impact Fund and its parent, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, from 2017 through 2022, according to a financial analysis from the Center for Media and Democracy. Lawsuits filed by the groups, which overlap with some Republican party litigation, focus in part on conspiratorial charges of non-citizen voting, which is exceedingly rare, and bloated voter rolls, and pre-sage more lawsuits by Trump if his presidential run fails, in an echo of his 2020 election-denialist claims, say watchdogs. \u201cIt seems clear that the lawsuits these rightwing groups are bringing attacking the integrity of the voting rolls, methods of voting and how the ballots are counted are an attempt to make it harder for people to vote, disenfranchise and intimidate legitimate voters, and create confusion,\u201d said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission. Noble added: \u201cAt the same time, they also appear to be laying the groundwork to challenge the results of the election after November 5, if Trump loses.\u201d You can read the full story here: As we mentioned in the opening summary, Donald Trump will be campaigning in North Carolina \u2013 a crucial swing state \u2013 today. The Republican presidential nominee is visiting the city of Asheville to survey the damage Hurricane Helene brought last month. Communities in western North Carolina have been reeling since the storm ravaged the region, killing about 100 people and destroying homes and causing widespread power outages. Trump has falsely accused Joe Biden and Kamala Harris of deliberately diverting assistance away from Republican areas. As well as visiting Asheville, Trump will be holding a rally in Greenville this afternoon, before attending a meeting of 11th Hour Faith leaders, alongside his son Eric and Dr Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, former US housing secretary, in Concord. You can keep up-to-date with Trump\u2019s campaign schedule here. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, will join Republican Congresswoman and vocal Trump opponent Liz Cheney in Chester County, Pennsylvania, for a campaign event before heading to Waukesha County, Wisconsin, and Oakland County, Michigan. There are mounting concerns from Trump\u2019s Republican allies that crippling damage from Hurricane Helene will depress turnout in the battleground state\u2019s conservative mountain regions. Trump won about 62% of the vote in 2020 in the 25 counties declared to be a disaster area after Helene, while Biden won about 51% in the remainder of the state. New emergency voting arrangements have been put in place by the state board of election covering some of the most devastated counties. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ\u2019s polling average shows North Carolina is too tight to call with confidence, with Harris, the US vice president and Democratic nominee, trailing behind Trump by 0.7 percentage points. More than one million North Carolinians have already voted in the November general election, according to estimates. More than 400 early voting sites opened as scheduled on Thursday. The Harris campaign reported raising $221.8m (\u00a3170.4m) in September, compared to Trump\u2019s campaign raising $62.7m (\u00a348.2m), the Washington Post reported after new federal campaign finance filings showed her huge financial advantage in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. The Federal Election Commission filings, released yesterday, also showed that the Democratic National Committee raised $98.6m (\u00a376m) last month, compared to the Republican National Committee raising $37.8m (\u00a329m). The Washington Post reported: New reports filed on Tuesday showed that Harris\u2019s primary fundraising vehicle for big-dollar donations, the Harris Victory Fund, brought in a staggering $633m (\u00a3486m) during the third quarter. That was more than four times as much as the $145m (\u00a3111m) that the victory fund\u2019s GOP counterpart, the Trump 47 committee, brought in, according to reports filed last week. Despite that huge spending edge and Harris\u2019s sprawling ground game, her campaign has still struggled to significantly outpace Trump in key swing state polls. The vice president\u2019s campaign has a much larger footprint than Trump\u2019s, which relies on outside groups to help it turn out voters, and her advisers are worried about whether they will have enough money to secure victory. Harris\u2019s advisers believe that the race remains close in all of the key swing states, and point to the high cost of targeting hard-to-reach and infrequent voters in seven very different states. Harris is running a campaign that is about three times the size of Trump\u2019s operation, spending more money on ads and having more staff, volunteers and a larger surrogate operation than her Republican opponent, according to a Washington Post analysis of campaign spending. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, is making an unexpected visit to Ukraine today to reaffirm Washington\u2019s support of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy when he meets him later. Austin is also expected to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov. US backing is crucial if Kyiv is to get support from other allies for proposals Zelenskyy believes are necessary to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s position on the battlefield and ahead of any peace negotiations. There are concerns that a second Trump administration could suspend military support for Kyiv, at a time when Ukraine is in desperate need for financial support and military equipment, much of which is supplied by the US. Kamala Harris seems set to follow Joe Biden\u2019s policy towards Ukraine, supplying Kyiv with military aid and supporting them diplomatically. She has ruled out meeting one-on-one with Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine unless leaders from Kyiv are involved. \u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely remarkable that Ukraine has been able to do what it\u2019s done,\u201d Austin told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s been able to do that, of course, because of the fact that we have supported them from the very beginning, and we\u2019ve rallied some 50 countries to be a part of that support,\u201d he added. Good morning, US politics readers. There are now only 15 days to go until voting day and the attacks traded between the two presidential candidates \u2013 Kamala Harris (D) and Donald Trump (R) \u2013 are intensifying. On Sunday, Harris celebrated her 60th birthday and gave an interview with Rev Al Sharpton on MSNBC. Sharpton asked her about Trump calling her a \u201cshit vice-president\u201d at a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. Harris, who became the first black vice-president and woman in the role after Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential election, responded: The American people deserve so much better. That is how I come at it. And to your point, the President of the United States must set a standard \u2013 not only for our nation but understanding the standard we as a nation must set for the world. We representing the United States of America walk into rooms around the world with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about the importance of democracy, of rule of law and have been thought of as a role model \u2026 of what it means to be committed to certain standards, including international rules and norms, but also standards of decorum. And what you see in my opponent, a former President of the United States, demeans the office. And I have said \u2013 and I am very clear about this \u2013 Donald Trump should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. He has not earned the right \u2026 and that is why he is going to lose. The presidential race is essentially deadlocked, both nationally and in so-called battleground states. The contest on 5 November will be decided by the slimmest of margins. In order to appeal to voters in the critical swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), both Trump and Harris are trying to appeal to moderate, swing voters and ensure their bases are enthused enough to go out and vote. Later today, Harris will be targeting suburban Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 holding a series of conversations with Republican Liz Cheney that will be moderated by Republican strategist Sarah Longwell and conservative radio host Charlie Sykes. Trump has three North Carolina stops on Monday, including a visit to see storm damage in Asheville. He beat Biden in the state by 1.3% in 2020, but the polls this year are extremely tight, giving the Democrats a rare chance of winning the state.",
